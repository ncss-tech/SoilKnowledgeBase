  "OVERVIEW": "The Rhylow series consists of very deep and well drained soils on tablelands, canyons, foothills and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. These soils formed in local alluvium and colluvium derived from loess, volcanic ash and igneous or sedimentary rocks. Rhylow soils have a moderately rapid permeability. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

Recent clearcut areas of these soils support communities dominated by pinegrass or elk sedge. The potential native vegetation are the subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry and subalpine fir/pinegrass plant associations."
