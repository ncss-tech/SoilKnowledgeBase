The soil formed in colluvium or local alluvium from loess, volcanic ash and igneous and sedimentary rocks. Cobbles and stones are dominantly angular. Elevations range from 5,300 to 10,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 22 to 35 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 29 to 39 degrees F. The frost-free season is less than 70 days."

These soils commonly support lodgepole pine/grouse whortleberry, lodgepole pine/pinegrass and Douglas fir/pinegrass communities. Recent clearcut areas of these soils support communities dominated by pinegrass or elk sedge. The potential native vegetation are the subalpine fir/grouse whortleberry and subalpine fir/pinegrass plant associations."
