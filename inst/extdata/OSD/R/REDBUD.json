Baraboo soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 inches).  Birkbeck, Campton, Elco, Minnith, Morningsun, Rockfield, Somonauk, and Zurich soils contain more than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Cadiz soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Eleroy and Rocheport soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Iona, Mayville, and Uniontown soils are less than 137 cm (54 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon.  Inton soils typically have gray iron depletions within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches). Libre soils have a dense layer (2Btd horizon) in the middle part of the argillic horizon. Winfield soils have overlapping soil properties within the series control section but do not have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redbud soils are on loess-covered lacustrine terraces treads and risers.  Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent.  These soils formed in 91 to about 152 cm (36 inches to about 60 inches) of loess (Peoria silt), and the underlying lacustrine deposits (Equality Formation).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1016 mm (36 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F).  Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 104 to 131 mm (340 to 430 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Bartelso and Millstadt soils are on nearly level or gently sloping convex treads of lacustrine terraces.  Also, Bartelso soils have a mollic epipedon.  The poorly drained Floraville and Lakaskia soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional treads of lacustrine terraces.  Also, the Lakaskia soils have a mollic epipedon.  The poorly drained Floraville soils and the somewhat poorly drained Millstadt soils form a hydrosequence with the Redbud soils.  The very poorly drained Wabash soils have a mollic epipedon and are in drainageways on lacustrine terraces."
