  "OVERVIEW": "The Redbud series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on loess-covered lacustrine terraces.  Redbud soils formed in loess and the underlying lacustrine deposits.  Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

Baraboo soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 inches).  Birkbeck, Campton, Elco, Minnith, Morningsun, Rockfield, Somonauk, and Zurich soils contain more than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Cadiz soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Eleroy and Rocheport soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Iona, Mayville, and Uniontown soils are less than 137 cm (54 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon.  Inton soils typically have gray iron depletions within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches). Libre soils have a dense layer (2Btd horizon) in the middle part of the argillic horizon. Winfield soils have overlapping soil properties within the series control section but do not have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower part of the series control section."
