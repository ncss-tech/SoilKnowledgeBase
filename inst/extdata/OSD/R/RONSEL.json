  "OVERVIEW": "The Ronsel series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till high in  serpentinized basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Ronsel soils are on mountain sides and valley floors at elevations of 3,000 to 5,200 feet.  Slope is 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 8 to 26 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The\nexchange complex is dominated by amorphous material in the family control section. Thickness of spodic horizon ranges from 4 to 8 inches.\nThe E horizon has a value of 5 through 7 dry, 3, 4, 6 moist, chroma of l, 2, or 3 dry and moist.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe Bs horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 dry and moist.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has a hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It is a very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It averages 25 to 35 percent pebbles and 5 to 25 percent cobbles.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe 2C horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry and moist, chroma of 4 or 6 dry.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or extremely stony sandy loam.  It averages 25 to 40 percent pebbles, l0 to 35 percent cobbles and 0 to 25 percent stones.  Reaction is medium acid or slightly acid."

Esmeralda soils have a solum more than 30 inches thick and a mean annual soil temperature of 40 to 42oF.  Gilpar soils have a solum 26 to 40  inches thick and have a hue of 10YR in the 2C horizon.  Jackman soils  have 40 to 60 percent dunite fragments in the particle-size control  section.  Kachess soils have a solum 26 to 38 inches thick and a spodic  horizon 6  to 11 inches thick.  Kindy, Ohana, Waptus and Vabus soils  have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Lemah soils have a solum  26 to 40 inches thick and a spodic horizon 1 to 3 inches thick.  Playco  soils have the upper part of the spodic horizon formed in volcanic ash  and pumice.  Thetis soils have a solum 28 to 50 inches thick and the  soils are dry for 15 to 30 consecutive days in the moisture control  section."
