  "OVERVIEW": "The Ragsdale series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loess. The Ragsdale soils are on terraces and uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
