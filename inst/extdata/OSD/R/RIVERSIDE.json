  "OVERVIEW": "The Riverside series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium. These soils are on fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, hills, and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 368 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
