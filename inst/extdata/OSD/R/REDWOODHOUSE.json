These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from interbedded sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 300 days."

Redcrest soils have less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser in the particle size control section.  Mailridge and Mountbaldy soils are on convex ridge and bench shoulder positions. Yagercreek soils are on linear to convex positions dominated by strongly cemented sandstone. Redcrest soils occur on areas of weakly cemented siltstone and fine grained sandstone."
