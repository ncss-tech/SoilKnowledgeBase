  "OVERVIEW": "The Raton series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basalt on mesas, plateaus, ridges and hills.  Slopes are 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees.",
