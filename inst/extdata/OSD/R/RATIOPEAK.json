  "OVERVIEW": "The Ratiopeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from fine grained sandstone or fine grained igneous rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, stream terraces, hills, mountain slopes, ridges and landslides. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
