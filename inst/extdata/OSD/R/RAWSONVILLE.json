  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mineral solum and depth to bedrock range from 50 to 100 cm. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout the mineral soil. Rock fragments are mostly gravel, cobbles channers, or stones and range from 0 to 30 percent throughout.\nThe O horizons, where present, have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. The E horizon may be discontinuous because of tree throw and other disturbances.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR with value and chroma of 3 or less.\nSome pedons have a Bh horizon that is neutral with value of 2 or less or has hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 1.\nSome pedons have a Bs horizon with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or more and chroma of 4 or more.\nThe Bhs, Bs, and Bh horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. They are moderately or weakly smeary.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a C or Cd horizon with hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nBedrock is slightly weathered schist, gneiss, phyllite, granite, or anorthosite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rawsonville soils are on glaciated uplands. They are on mountain tops, mountain side slopes, ridges, hill tops, and hill slopes. Slope ranges from 3 to 70 percent. The soils formed in loamy glacial till of Wisconsin age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 790 to 2,420 mm, and the mean annual temperature ranges from -3 to 9 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from about 60 to 120 days. Elevation is typically between 450 to 950 meters."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The shallow Hogback and very deep Houghtonville soils are on similar landscapes. The very deep Mundal soils are moderately well drained, have a dense substratum, and are on slightly lower positions on the landscape. The very deep Ampersand soils are somewhat poorly drained, have a dense substratum, and are on nearly level to steep, shallow depressions and drainageways. The very deep Wilmington soils are poorly drained, have a dense substratum, and are on nearly level to sloping, concave, or depressional areas."
