The matrix of the control section is clay loam or clay with clay ranging from 35 to 50 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.\nThe soil has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Rhoame soils are on alluvial fans and valley-filling sideslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Elevation is 3,200 to 6,000 feet.  These soils formed in thick, fine textured, noncalcareous sediments derived principally from the weathering of noncalcareous, partly metamorphosed shale.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 95 to 100 days."
