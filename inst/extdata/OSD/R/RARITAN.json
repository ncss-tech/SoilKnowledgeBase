  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 42 to 56 inches. Depth to unconforming material is more than 40 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 5 to 20 feet. The amount of water rounded gravel in the solum ranges from 0 to 15 percent and from 0 to 50 percent in the C horizon. The solum and substratum range from very strongly acid through moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. In undisturbed areas a thin A horizon has a value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is typically weak or moderate fine or medium granular. Consistence is friable. Reaction varies with cultural practices.\nThe BA and Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Btx horizons and redox features have hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 6. Low chroma of redox features occur at depths less than 16 inches or in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Texture is typically loam, silt loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction but the range includes silty clay loam and sandy clay loam. Structure is weak to moderate medium subangular blocky. Consistence is friable to firm becoming very firm and brittle with depth. Structure of the fragipan is typically weak to moderate very coarse prismatic parting to moderate medium subangular blocky or moderate coarse platy.\nThe C horizon has color similar to the B horizon but tending to be lower in value and chroma. Texture of the stratified sediments range from silty clay loam to gravel."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Cookport, Glenville, and Kedron series are in the same family. All of these soils lack rounded rock fragments and unconforming C horizons of sand, silt, and gravel. In addition, Cookport soils have hues of 7.5YR or yellower and have a solum less than 48 inches thick and Glenville soils have hues of 7.5YR or yellower and contain mica."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Raritan soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping stream terraces, usually above present overflow. Slopes range from 0 to about l5 percent. The soils are formed in alluvium sediments from reddish, noncalcareous shale, siltstone and sandstone uplands. The climate is humid temperate with mean annual precipitation of 38 to 46 inches, mean annual air temperatures of 50 to 55 degrees F., and a frost-free season of 150 to 200 days."

Well drained Klinesville, Lewisberry and Penn and moderately well drained Readington and Reaville are some of the more important soils on nearby uplands. Well drained Bermudian, moderately well drained Rowland, somewhat poorly drained Bowmansville and poorly drained Knauers are on adjacent flood plains."
