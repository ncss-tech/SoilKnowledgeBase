The soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days during the summer months. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay and has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or loam with 10 to 18 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent boulders, 0 to 15 percent stones, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent gravel. Organic matter is 3 to 4 percent.\nThe A2 and A3 horizons have color similar to the horizon above. It has 0 to 5 percent stones, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent gravel. Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent.\nThe AC horizon, when present, has color and texture similar to the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. It is sandy loam or loam with 5 to 15 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent stones, 15 to 30 percent cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent gravel."

Baldridge soils are dry 45 to 60 consecutive days and have a cambic horizon. Beehunt soils have a cambic horizon and a pscs with 18 to 25 percent clay.  Burgi soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Chambeam soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock, have 20 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and have channer and flagstone size rock fragments. Climine soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and a 2Bq horizon at 20 to 30 inches. Glean soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact and have angular basalt and andesite rock fragments. Lambring soils are dry for more than one half of the time when the temperature is greater than 41 degrees F. and average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Sinker, and Westbutte soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Ginser soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact. Shorthike soils have a cambic horizon and are dry for greater than 75 consecutive days.  Smidale soils have cambic horizons and mollic epipedons 50 inches or more thick. St. Anthony soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Webfoot soils are somewhat poorly drained and have low chroma mottles beginning 6 inches below the surface.

They formed in glacial till of mixed mineralogy including basalt, quartz diorite, greenstone, shale, sandstone and limestone with an influence of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature of 42 to 45 degrees F.
