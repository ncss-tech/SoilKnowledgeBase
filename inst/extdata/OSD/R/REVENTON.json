The soils formed in alluvium derived from\nnearby ridges and mountains underlain by limestone or basic\nigneous rocks.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 to\n55 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to\n16 inches, but the soil receives an additional 4 to 6 inches\nfrom surrounding areas.  Elevations are 6,000 to 7,000 feet.  Frost-free period is about 160 to 180 days."
