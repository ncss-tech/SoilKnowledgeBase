  "OVERVIEW": "The Reventon series consists of deep, well drained soils\nthat formed in alluvium from sedimentary and igneous rocks.\nThese soils are on concave side slopes. Slopes range from 0\nto 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches\nand mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
