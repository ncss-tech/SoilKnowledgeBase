  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Razorback series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks.  Razorback soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 1 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Akela (NM), Beach (TX), Dalvord (CA), Galehills (NV), Haleburu (NV), Hindu (AZ), Hulda (AZ), Noble Pass (CA), Paintrocks (CA), Pearce (AZ), Tecopa (CA), Terlingua (TX) and Upspring (CA) soils.  Akela soils are usually dry from October through May and formed on Basalt.  Beach soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and formed on metamorphic sandstone.  Dalvord soils do not have visible accumulations of calcium carbonate and formed in granite. Galehills soils have a drier soil moisture control section due to a mean annual precipitation of 3 to 5 inches and formed in sandstone conglomerate. Haleburu soils formed from rhyolite and are drier in the soil moisture control section.  Hindu soils are moist for more than 20 cumulative days during July-September.  Hulda soils have dominantly cobble-size rock fragments and coarse and very coarse sands and formed from granite.  Noble Pass soils are dry in the summer.  Paintrocks soils are less than 3 inches deep to a paralithic contact and have a lithic contact begins at 3 inches and formed in granite.  Pearce soils have rock fragments that are dominated by gravel and formed in limestone.  Terlingua soils are dry in the winter. Tecopa and Upspring soils are usually dry from June through November with Tecopa soils forming in quartz and schist."

Elevations range from 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 200 to 280 days."
