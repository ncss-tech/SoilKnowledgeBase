  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Regal series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loamy material overlying calcareous sandy and gravelly material on outwash plains and stream terraces.  These soils have moderate permeability in the upper mantle and rapid permeability in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The thickness of the fine-loamy mantle ranges from 15 to 20 inches.  Typically, free carbonates occur throughout the upper 10 inches, however some pedons are noneffervescent.  The upper loamy mantle averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent fine sand and coarser.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology comprise up to 10 percent (by volume) of the upper mantle and 10 to 45 percent of the underlying material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 with distinct 4 to 6 chroma mottles.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is stratified with textures of loamy sand, sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches."

Dual particle size class- abrupt textural change at about 18 inches.\nClassification only was changed 5/94.  Competing series and other updates will be made later.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
