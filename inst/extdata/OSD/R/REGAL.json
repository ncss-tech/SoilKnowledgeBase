  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The thickness of the fine-loamy mantle ranges from 15 to 20 inches.  Typically, free carbonates occur throughout the upper 10 inches, however some pedons are noneffervescent.  The upper loamy mantle averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent fine sand and coarser.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology comprise up to 10 percent (by volume) of the upper mantle and 10 to 45 percent of the underlying material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 with distinct 4 to 6 chroma mottles.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is stratified with textures of loamy sand, sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Regal soils are on nearly level outwash plains and stream terraces with slightly concave to slightly convex slopes typically less than 2 percent.  They formed in a fine-loamy upper mantle 15 to 20 inches thick overlying calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches."

Estherville and Hawick soils are in higher lying positions with better drainage.  The organic soils are in large post-glacial basins."

Dual particle size class- abrupt textural change at about 18 inches.\nClassification only was changed 5/94.
