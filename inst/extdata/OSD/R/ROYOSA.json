  "OVERVIEW": "The Royosa series consists of very deep, excessively or somewhat excessively drained, rapid and very rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian parent material derived from sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
