  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev.GDW-WEF",
  "REVDATE": "02/2003",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockcut series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy deposits, underlain by stratified loamy material on former glacial river flood plains. Permeability is rapid in the sandy upper part and moderately slow in the loamy lower part. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 15 to 25 inches. Depth to the stratified material ranges from 14 to 21 inches. Gravel content in the sandy upper part ranges from 10 to 30 percent and cobble and stone content ranges from 20 to 50 percent. The control section averages greater than 35 percent rock fragments. The 2BC horizon has up to 10 percent cobbles and 5 to 15 percent gravel. Reaction of the solum ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid and reaction of the substratum ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is extremely stony or very stony analogues of sandy loam or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is the extremely cobbly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly or very gravelly analogues of loamy sand, sand or coarse sand.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is stratified silt loam, loamy sand, silty clay loam, sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is stratified silt, silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay."
