Last revised on 10/2013.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nSeries control section: 0 to 200 centimeters\nParticle size control section: 25 to 100 centimeters (10 to 40 inches).\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches). (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 46 to 89 centimeters (18 to 35 inches). (Bk1 horizon)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nLAN 3/2013 The previous classification of calcareous Ustic Torriorthents became obsolete following a field project that indicated soils in the area had mollic epipedons.  As a result of this update, the type location has been moved from from Prowers County, Colorado to Otero County, Colorado and taxonomic class changes to Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls.\nTaxonomic Version: Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
