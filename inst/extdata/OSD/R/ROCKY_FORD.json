  "OVERVIEW": "The Rocky Ford series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium Rocky Ford soils are on terraces. The surface horizon formed in clayey alluvium from sediment-rich irrigation water. The subsoil and substratum formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary materials. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F.) and the mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches).",

(Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 46 to 89 centimeters (18 to 35 inches). (Bk1 horizon)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nLAN 3/2013 The previous classification of calcareous Ustic Torriorthents became obsolete following a field project that indicated soils in the area had mollic epipedons.  As a result of this update, the type location has been moved from from Prowers County, Colorado to Otero County, Colorado and taxonomic class changes to Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls.\nTaxonomic Version: Eleventh Edition, 2010."
