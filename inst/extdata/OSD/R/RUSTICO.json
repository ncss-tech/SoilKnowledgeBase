They are usually dry in some part of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days out of the 120 days after 21st of June.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature: 9 to 11 degrees C.\nMean summer soil temperature: 19 to 22 degrees C.\nMollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 75 cm.\nOther features: Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth or remains above 0.5 percent within the depth of 127 cm. Buried A horizons within or below the C horizon are common, and may have few fine faint redoximorphic features.\nParticle-size control section (weighted average):\nClay content: 27 to 35 percent.\nSand content: Less than 15 percent of fine sand or coarser.\nEffervescence: The upper part of the control section is effervescent and the  lower part is noneffervescent.\nCalcium carbonate: the control section contains filaments of calcium carbonate.\nA horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR.\nValue: 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nC horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR.\nValue: 2 to 4 moist and 4 to 6 dry.\nChroma: 2 to 4.\nMottles: Few fine faint relic redoximorphic features occur in many pedons.\nTexture: Silty clay loam or clay loam, with some pedons having subhorizons of loam.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

Caldwell, Loupence and Snow soils are noneffervescent throughout.  Harana soils have noneffervescent A horizons, chroma of 1 in the control section and chroma of 1 or less below 100 cm.  Jett and Red Rock soils have silt loam control sections averaging 18 to 27 percent clay.  Keigley soils are effervescent throughout and carbonates are disseminated.  Keigley soils also have a xeric soil moisture regime."
