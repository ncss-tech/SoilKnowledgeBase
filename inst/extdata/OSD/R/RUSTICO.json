  "OVERVIEW": "The Rustico series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Rustico soils occur on stream terraces and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",

The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature: 9 to 11 degrees C.\nMean summer soil temperature: 19 to 22 degrees C.\nMollic epipedon thickness: 50 to 75 cm.\nOther features: Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth or remains above 0.5 percent within the depth of 127 cm. Buried A horizons within or below the C horizon are common, and may have few fine faint redoximorphic features.\nParticle-size control section (weighted average):\nClay content: 27 to 35 percent.\nSand content: Less than 15 percent of fine sand or coarser.\nEffervescence: The upper part of the control section is effervescent and the  lower part is noneffervescent.\nCalcium carbonate: the control section contains filaments of calcium carbonate.\nA horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR.\nValue: 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nC horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR.\nValue: 2 to 4 moist and 4 to 6 dry.\nChroma: 2 to 4.\nMottles: Few fine faint relic redoximorphic features occur in many pedons.\nTexture: Silty clay loam or clay loam, with some pedons having subhorizons of loam.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."
