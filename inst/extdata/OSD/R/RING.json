  "OVERVIEW": "The Ring series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in fine to coarse textured material weathered from sandstone, shale, and igneous intrusive rocks. These soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping outwash terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
