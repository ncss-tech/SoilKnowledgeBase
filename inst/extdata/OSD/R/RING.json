  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The annual soil temperature is about 45 degrees F. and the summer soil temperature is about 60 degrees F.  The solum ranges from 30 to 45 inches thick.  In some pedons there are lenses and pockets of sandstone and shale at a depth of 50 inches.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 40 percent in the A horizon, from 20 to 35 percent of the B21t horizon, from 40 to 65 percent of the B22t and B23t horizons, and 45 to 75 percent in the C horizon.  Stones make up about 45 percent, cobbles about 40 percent, and pebbles about 15 percent.  Some pedons lack an 0 horizon.  The A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has weak or moderate, fine or very fine granular structure.  The B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is sandy clay or heavy sandy clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay and 45 to 60 percent sand.  This horizon has weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and moist.  It is sandy clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  This horizon has weak coarse subangular blocky structure or it is massive."

    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Ring soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping outwash terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Elevation ranges from 8,000 to 8,500 feet.  The soils formed in fine to coarse textured material weathered from sandstone, shale, and igneous intrusive rocks.  The climate is continental with an annual temperature of about 43 degrees F. and a summer temperature of about 58 degrees F.  The annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 18 inches with about 60 percent falling during the frost free period."
