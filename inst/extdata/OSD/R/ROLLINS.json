  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to gravelly loamy sand or coarser material ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The depth to free carbonates is more than 80 inches. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the mantle, and 15 to 75 percent in the underlying sediment. It averages 35 to 65 percent in the particle size control section. The loamy mantle contains less than 50 percent fine sand and finer particles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 15 percent by volume with 3 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 7 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones and boulders. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 through 6. It is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly loam or their nongravelly analogues. The rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent. The gravel content ranges from 3 to 35 percent. Thin subhorizons may contain 35 to 65 percent gravel. Cobbles range from 0 to 7 percent. The stone and boulder content ranges from 0 to 3 percent. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a 2Bw horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 6. Some pedons have hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 in some Rainy lobe materials. It is very gravelly sand, very gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly analogues. The gravel content ranges from 35 to 75 percent. Thin subhorizons below 40 inches may contain 5 to 95 percent gravel. Cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent. The stone and boulder content ranges from 0 to 3 percent. It is moderately or slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rollins soils have linear to convex slopes on outwash plains, moraines, drumlins and eskers. They formed in a loamy mantle overlying acid, gravelly glacial outwash. The material is from the Rainy Lobe, Superior Lobe or mixed from both sources and is of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 30 inches. Annual frost-free days range from 90 to 120 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 1,150 to 1,650 feet."
