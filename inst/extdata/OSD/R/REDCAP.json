Pumice cinder content averages 35 to 50 percent by volume in the 10 to 24 inch portion of the control section. The underlying residual soil is 24 to 36 inches thick. Andesite gravel content averages 40 to 50 percent by volume in the 24 to 40 inch portion of the control section.  Depth to andesite flow rock or compacted glacial till is 40 to over 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. The soil is dry in the 12 to 24 inch control section from July to mid-October. It is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year. O horizons are 1/2 inch to 1 1/2 inches thick.\nThe A horizon of the surface soil has dry color of lOYR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2 or 7/3 and moist color of lOYR 4/2, 5/2 5/3 6/2, 6/3, or 6/4.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redcap soils are on sideslopes of volcanic mountain peaks at elevations of 5,000 to 6,600 feet. Slopes are 20 to 50 percent.  The soils are formed in pumice cinders deposited over a soil formed from pyroclastic material and weathered from andesite flow rock. The depth of the over-lying pumice soil is dependent on the distance from source. It is 20 to 36 inches. The climate is continental and subhumid with warm nearly dry summers and cold, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches. Snowfall is 20 to 45 inches and lasts from early December until early April in most years. Mean January temperature is 25 to 30 degrees F.; mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 40 to 65 days."
