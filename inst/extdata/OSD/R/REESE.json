Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,465 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Bubus soils are coarse-loamy and have durinodes in a friable matrix.  Duffer soils are fine-silty and have calcic horizons.  Sombrero soils are shallow to duripans.  Sonoma soils are fine-silty and have buried A horizons."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 150 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) year-round and ranges up to depths of 30 to 90 cm for brief periods during the spring runoff period between March and July.  Cumulative annual duration class for deep endosaturation is Persistent.  Flooding is none, rare or occasional.  Some phases are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration year-round with water up to 30 cm deep.  A drained phase is recognized."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The revision of July 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aeric Halaquepts.  Future study is needed to determine the amount of volcanic glass in this series and whether the taxonomic class should be changed to Ashy, glassy, calcareous, mesic Aquandic Halaquepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1 and part of the A2 horizons).\nDurinodes - The zones from 48 to 69 cm and 124 to 152 cm (Cq and Cqk2 horizons).\nDuric feature - The zone from 69 to 100 cm (Cqk1 horizon).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 46 and 90 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the C, Cq, and Cqk1 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Cq horizon and parts of the C and Cqk1 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon from Lake County, Oregon is reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S86OR-037-005 (pedon # 86P0991).  Selected data are available.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
