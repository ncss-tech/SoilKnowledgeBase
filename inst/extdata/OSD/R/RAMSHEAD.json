  "OVERVIEW": "The Ramshead series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary rocks. Ramshead soils are on hills. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
