  "OVERVIEW": "The Raftriver series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from schist, quartzite, and volcanic ash on dissected fan terraces. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 355 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
