  "OVERVIEW": "The Rabun series consists of deep, well drained permeable soils\nthat formed in residuum weathered from dark colored rock high in ferromagnesium minerals.  These soils are on gently sloping to\nsteep ridges and mountain slopes.  The slope is dominately 25 to 45 percent but ranges from 2 to 50 percent.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 72 inches.",

Medium to coarse red and brown mottles range from none to common.  Texture is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, stony clay loam, clay, or cobbly clay loam.  Pebbles, cobbles, and stones range from 10 to 25 percent, many of which are fragments of saprolite.\nThe C horizon has hues of 10R to 2.5YR, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of 6 through8.  This fine earth fraction of clay loam and loam fills cracks, pockets, and space between rock fragments.  The soil comprises 3 to 8 percent of the horizon by volume.  Pebbles, cobbles, and greenstone make up the remainder of the horizon.  2 to 20 percent of these fragments are hard, others are weathered\nand soft."
