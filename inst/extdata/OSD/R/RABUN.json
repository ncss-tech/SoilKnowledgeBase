    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to hard rock ranges from 5 to 10 feet or more.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, clay loam,\nor silt loam.  Eroded areas range to clay texture.  Pebbles,\ncobbles, and stones range from 2 to 35 percent by volume.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hues of 10R to 2.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of\n2 through 6.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or\nclay.  Pebbles and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hues of 10R to 2.5YR, values of 3 or 4 and\nchroma of 2 through 8.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty\nclay, or clay.  Pebbles and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.  Structure ranges from moderate to strong angular to subangular blocky.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10R to 2.5YR, values of 3 or 4 and\nchroma of 2 through  8.  Medium to coarse red and brown mottles\nrange from none to common.  Texture is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, stony clay loam, clay, or cobbly clay loam.  Pebbles,\ncobbles, and stones range from 10 to 25 percent, many of which are fragments of saprolite.\nThe C horizon has hues of 10R to 2.5YR, values of 3 or 4, and\nchroma of 6 through8.  This fine earth fraction of clay loam and\nloam fills cracks, pockets, and space between rock fragments.  The soil comprises 3 to 8 percent of the horizon by volume.  Pebbles, cobbles, and greenstone make up the remainder of the horizon.  2\nto 20 percent of these fragments are hard, others are weathered\nand soft."

Coronaca, Cumberland, and Davidson soils have solum thickness of more than 60 inches; in addition, Coronaca and Cumberland soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  Dyke soils have mixed mineralogy and a regolith of local colluvial material in concave and toeslope landscapes.  Gwinnett, Hanceville, Hiwassee, Musella, and Tellico soils have mean annual soil temperatures higher than 59 degrees F.  In addition, Musella soils have a solum thickness less than 20 inches.  Rapidan soils\nhave more than 35 percent silt in the control section."
