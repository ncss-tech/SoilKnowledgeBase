The reference to I-10 and Wilmont Rd. does not agree with the PLSS.  More importantly, and concerning, is there is no Rillino mapped in either place.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nUpdated competing series section December 2008, CEM\nRevised for the correlation of AZ661, 2/2009, WWJ\nRevised for the correlation of AZ675, 5/2009, WWJ\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data numbers; S79AZ 003 013, S84AZ 003 400, and S84AZ 003 418.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
