  "OVERVIEW": "The Retsongulch series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from coarse grained metamorphic rocks, mainly metadiorite.  Retsongulch soils are on canyon side slopes in metamorphic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 50 to 100 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 73 inches, (1854 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F, (11 degrees C).",
