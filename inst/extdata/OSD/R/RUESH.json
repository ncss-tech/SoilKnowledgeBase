  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruesh series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from sedimentary formations high in gypsum.  Ruesh soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 3 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
