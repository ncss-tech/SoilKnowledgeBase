  "OVERVIEW": "The Rogrube series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and residuum derived from gypsiferous shales.  Rogrube soils are on plateaus.  Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The moisture control section is dry in all parts more than three-fourths of the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature is 41 degree7 F. or higher at a depth of 20 inches.  The particle size control section averages 18 to 34 percent clay.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 2 to 20 inches; depth to the gypsic horizon is 17 to 45 inches.  The product of the percentage of gypsum and the thickness in centimeters of the gypsic horizon above a depth of 60 inches is 400 to 1,500.  The calcic horizon averages 20 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist.  Textures are sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 15 to 35 percent and is both disseminated and concentrated in white filaments.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe By horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The content of gypsum ranges from 5 to 25 percent in individual subhorizons and occurs as white powders, filaments, and sometimes visible crystals.  Reaction is mildly alkaline and moderately alkaline."
