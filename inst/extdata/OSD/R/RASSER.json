  "OVERVIEW": "The Rasser series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains and foothills. They formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived from metasedimentary bedrock that is influenced with loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. The average annual temperature is about 44 degrees and the average annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",
