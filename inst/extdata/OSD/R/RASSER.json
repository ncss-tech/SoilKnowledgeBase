  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rasser soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains and foothills. Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived dominantly from metasedimentary bedrock, with an influence of loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface.  Elevation ranges from 2,700 to 3,700 feet. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches, including 3 to 6 feet of snow. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

Huckle soils are on north-facing backslopes, have a thick volcanic ash mantle and have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches."
