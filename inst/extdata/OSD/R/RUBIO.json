These soils are moderately acid or strongly acid in the most acid part.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1, or is olive gray (5Y 5/2).  Redox concentrations have 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 3 through 8.  Redox depletions of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 are evident in interiors of peds in the lower part of the Btg horizon.  The upper part of the argillic horizon contains 35 to 42 percent clay.  Textures are silty clay loam or silty clay.  Some coatings of silt are evident in the upper part of the Btg horizon.\nThe BCg and C horizons have hue of 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The BCg and C horizons are silty clay loam with clay content ranging from 32 to 38 percent."

Adco, Appanoose, Awbrig, Belinda, Chariton, Glensted, and Putnam soils average more than 42 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Brooklyn and Cisne soils contain more sand in the sola.  Cowden soils contain layers below the sola that contain more sand.  Denny soils average less than 32 percent clay in the lower part of the control section.  Wagner soils have strata in the lowest part of the control section with as much as 90 percent sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rubio soils are in slight depressions or on nearly level, broad, upland divides, and on broad, nearly level high stream terraces.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  Rubio soils formed in loess of Wisconsin age which ranges from 10 to 16 feet in thickness and contains less than 5 percent sand.  Carbonates are usually lacking in the loess, but thin, discontinuous layers of secondary carbonates are below a depth of 60 inches in some places.   Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 50 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 34 inches.  The annual frost free period ranges from about 155 to 180 days.  Elevation ranges from about 650 to 1350 feet above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Givin and Ladoga soils. The somewhat poorly drained Givin soils are on the nearly level divides and high stream benches and generally border the Rubio soils.  The moderately well drained Ladoga soils are on convex slopes at lower elevations."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Rubio soils are poorly or very poorly drained.  The poorly drained areas are on the nearly level broad divides and the very poorly drained areas are in depressions.  Surface runoff typically is very slow, and permeability is slow.  The intermittent perched seasonal high water table is +.5 to 1 foot for some time from November through July during most years."
