    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carpetflat (CA), Cheme (NV), Cherioni (AZ), Cipriano (AZ), and Tyro (AZ) series. Carpetflat soils are 18 to 36 centimeters to the upper boundary of a very strongly cemented duripan. Cheme, Cipriano, Cherioni and Tyro soils do not have a rock C horizon above the A horizon. In addition, Cheme soils have semi-consolidated gravelly sediments below the duripan and Cipriano and Cherioni soils are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative from July to September. In addition, Cherioni soils are formed in volcanic materials and have a lithic contact within a depth of 15 centimeters. Tyro soils are on pediments with a lithic contact between 15 and 48 centimeters and have a calcic horizon above the duripan."

Elevations range from 515 to 800 meters (1,690 to 2,625 feet). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."
