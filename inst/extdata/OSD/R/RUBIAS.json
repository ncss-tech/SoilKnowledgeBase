Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral throughout, except where the surface has been limed.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Content of rock fragments range from 5 to 12 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Content of rock fragments range from 5 to 40 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Content of rock fragments range from 5 to 10 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam.\nThe Cr layer is composed of moderately weathered, unconsolidated mudstone. It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanized equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured consolidated mudstone."

A soil moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature regime at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic Soil Moisture Regime) and 900 meters above sea level (in Udic Soil Moisture Regime) and adjusted the isothermic-isohyperthermic line.\nRubias soils are in MLRA 270.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
