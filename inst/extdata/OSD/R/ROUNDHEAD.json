  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The McGuffey and Olentangy soils are in closely related families. McGuffey soils have illitic clay mineralogy and average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Olentangy soils are formed in coprogenous earth, and do not have carbonates in the upper part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Roundhead soils typically are on broad, nearly level areas or in depressions associated with Wisconsin age lake plains. Slope gradients are less than 1 percent. The soils formed in organic plant material in former marshes and bogs and in the underlying silty glaciolacustrine sediments. However, drainage of the marshes, subsidence, and loss of surface has nearly depleted the organic soil material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 274 to 305 meters (900 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carlisle, Linwood, McGuffey, Milford, Montgomery, Patton, and Willette soils. Carlisle, Linwood, and Willette soils have surface layers of sapric material more than 41 cm (16 inches) thick. Carlisle soils are in the deepest part of the lake basin or upper end of drainage systems where organic materials have accumulated to the greatest depth. Linwood and Willette soils are in landscape positions between Roundhead and Carlisle soils. McGuffey soils are on similar landscape positions as Roundhead soils. Milford, Montgomery, and Patton soils are very poorly drained mineral soils on the perimeter of the lake plain."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between December and June in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic material and moderately high or moderately low in the underlying glaciolacustrine material. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the organic material and slow or moderately slow in the underlying glaciolacustrine material."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Roundhead series were originally identified as Carlisle or Linwood series, but with continued subsidence and loss of surface by soil blowing these soils no longer qualify as Histosols.\nA loamy substratum phase has been recognized. This phase should be investigated during MLRA update activities to determine if sufficient acreage exists to warrant the development of a new series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nHistic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Oap horizon).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 94 cm (Bg horizon).\nAquic conditions: from the surface to a depth of 152 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data is available from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory for HD-23, the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
