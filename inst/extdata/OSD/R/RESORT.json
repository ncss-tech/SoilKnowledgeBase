  "OVERVIEW": "The Resort series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in materials derived from weathered granite, rhyolite, and basic andesite.  Resort soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 3 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

(Cr horizons)\nThe assignment of the paramicaceous mineralogy is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010."
