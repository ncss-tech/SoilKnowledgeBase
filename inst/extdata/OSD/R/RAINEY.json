The soils formed in residuum, alluvium, and colluvium\nweathered from coarse-grained intrusive igneous bedrock, which is high\nin quartz and mica.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 5,500 feet.\nAverage annual precipitation is 13 to 20 inches, including 3 to 6 feet\nof snow.  Average annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.\nFrost-free period is 90 to 160 days."
