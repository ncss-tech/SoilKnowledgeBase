  "OVERVIEW": "The Rainey series consists of moderately deep over bedrock, well\ndrained soils on south-facing hillsides and ridgetops.  They formed in\nmaterial weathered from coarse-grained intrusive igneous rocks.\nPermeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes are 15 to 40 percent.  The\naverage annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual\nair temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Elevations range from 2,000 to 5,500 feet.\nAverage annual precipitation is 13 to 20 inches, including 3 to 6 feet\nof snow.  Average annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.\nFrost-free period is 90 to 160 days."
