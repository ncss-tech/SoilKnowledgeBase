  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches thick and depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon of the upper 15 inches is approximately 0.8 percent and the sand/clay ratio ranges from less than 1 to about 3.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are typically less than 5 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 76 degrees F.  The A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It usually has granular or crumb structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard and slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It usually has prismatic structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is typically heavy clay loam or light clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay, 15 to 45 percent silt, and 15 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Oriented clay films occur in some part of the horizon.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The C horizon if present has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

Agua Fria, Baca, Bew, Hesper, Manzanola, Panky, Thurlow, Ulm, and Wyarno soils lack a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Arp soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Mughouse soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments throughout the solum most of which are stones larger than 10 inches in diameter.  Renohill soils are calcareous above a depth of 40 inches and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Rencalson soils are on gently to moderately sloping upland hills and ridges.  Slopes usually range from 2 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in fine textured, noncalcareous parent sediments weathered from noncalcareous sedimentary bedrock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 46 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 68 degrees F."
