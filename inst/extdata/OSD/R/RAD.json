These soils formed in loess high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevations are 975 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."
