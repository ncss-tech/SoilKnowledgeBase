  "OVERVIEW": "The Rad series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  The Rad soils are on fan piedmont remnants, inset fans, fan skirts and narrow hill drainageways and terraces. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
