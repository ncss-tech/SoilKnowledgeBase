    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roden soils are on hills, mountains, and rock pediments.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from calcareous shale, sandstone, siltstone, and claystone. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,890 to 2,195 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
