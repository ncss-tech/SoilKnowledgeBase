  "OVERVIEW": "The Roden series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from calcareous shale, sandstone, siltstone, and claystone.  Roden soils are on hills, mountains, and rock pediments. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
