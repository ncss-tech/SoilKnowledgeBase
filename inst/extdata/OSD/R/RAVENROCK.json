  "OVERVIEW": "The Ravenrock series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils with a seasonal water table in the substratum. They formed in colluvium or soil creep from chloritic metabasalt (greenstone) or metarhyolite and occur on mountain tread-riser backslopes and footslopes. Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.",

Aquic conditions and redoximorphic features in some pedons are below a depth of 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 1 to 50 percent on and in the surface, 15 to 70 percent in individual subsoil and substratum horizons with a weighted average of greater than 35 percent in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon. Rock outcrops of metabasalt commonly occur within Ravenrock soil landscapes and occupy from 0 to 25 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE, EB, and/or E horizons where present have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through B. It is commonly silt loam or loam, but ranges to clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. Redoximorphic features are evident in some pedons.

These soils are generally stony, very stony, extremely stony or bouldery and commonly occur with 0 to 25 percent rock outcrops of metabasalt. Ravenrock soils formed in colluvium and/or soil creep derived from metabasalt (greenstone) and metarhyolite. Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches. Elevations are 800 to 2,000 feet."
