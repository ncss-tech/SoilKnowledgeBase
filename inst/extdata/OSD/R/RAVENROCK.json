  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Aquic conditions and redoximorphic features in some pedons are below a depth of 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 1 to 50 percent on and in the surface, 15 to 70 percent in individual subsoil and substratum horizons with a weighted average of greater than 35 percent in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon. Rock outcrops of metabasalt commonly occur within Ravenrock soil landscapes and occupy from 0 to 25 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE, EB, and/or E horizons where present have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through B. It is commonly silt loam or loam, but ranges to clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. Redoximorphic features are evident in some pedons. It is commonly clay loam, but ranges from loam to silty clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizons, where present, have hue of 2.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lew, Linganore and Neotoma series. Lew soils do not have redoximorphic features or aquic conditions in the lower part of the Bt horizon. Linganore soils are less than 40 inches to a paralithic contact. Neotoma soils have rock fragments dominated by siltstone or sandstone and depth to bedrock is 60 inches or less."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ravenrock soils are on tread-riser backslopes and footslopes in the Blue Ridge Mountains.  Slope is commonly 8 to 45 percent but ranges from 0 to 65percent. These soils are generally stony, very stony, extremely stony or bouldery and commonly occur with 0 to 25 percent rock outcrops of metabasalt. Ravenrock soils formed in colluvium and/or soil creep derived from metabasalt (greenstone) and metarhyolite. Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches. Elevations are 800 to 2,000 feet."

Bagtown, Highfield, and Spoolsville soils have less than 18 percent clay in the textural control section. Catoctin soils have a discontinuous argillic horizon and are less than 40 inches to bedrock. Foxville soils have redoximorphic features above 40 inches and are on adjacent floodplains. Lantz, Mt. Zion, Myersville, and Rohrersville soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the textural control section. In addition, Lantz and Rohrersville soils occur in swales and drainageways and have redoximorphic features and an aquic condition above a depth of 40 inches."
