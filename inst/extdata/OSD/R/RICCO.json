Blend soils have a buried soil at depths of 24 to 36 inches and occur in a udic soil moisture regime environment.  Darwin soils occur in a udic soil moisture regime environment.  Saddlerock soils are slightly or moderately alkaline and have 2 to 4 percent organic matter.  Stillwater soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 53 to 57 degrees F. and contain significant amounts of sodium.  Waldo soils are strongly acid to slightly acid and have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 56 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ricco soils are on low alluvial fans and floodplains at elevations of 2,400 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived largely from fine-textured waterlain sediments weathered from basalt, volcanic tuffs and diatomaceous earth.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches.  The mean July temperature is 66 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 32 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 150 days."
