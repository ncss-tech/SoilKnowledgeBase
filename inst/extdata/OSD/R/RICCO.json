  "OVERVIEW": "The Ricco series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Ricco soils are on low alluvial fans and floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived largely from fine-textured waterlain sediments weathered from basalt, volcanic tuffs and diatomaceous earth.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches.  The mean July temperature is 66 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 32 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 150 days."
