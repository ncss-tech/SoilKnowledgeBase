  "OVERVIEW": "The Riggins series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess mixed with material weathered from basalt. Riggins soils are on south-facing slopes of uplands and have gradients of 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Lacy soils are slightly acid to strongly acid in the Bt horizon and the rock fragments in the particle-size control section are dominantly cobbles and stones.

They formed in loess mixed with residuum and colluvium from Columbia River basalt or Seven Devils volcanics.  Elevation is 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The subhumid climate has moderately dry summers. Average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches. Average annual temperature is 45 degrees to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 110 to 140 days."
