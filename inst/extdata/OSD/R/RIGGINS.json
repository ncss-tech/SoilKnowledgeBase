Lacy soils are slightly acid to strongly acid in the Bt horizon and the rock fragments in the particle-size control section are dominantly cobbles and stones.  Ragpie soils have lime accumulations at the contact between the argillic horizon and the bedrock and have average annual precipitation of 14 to 16 inches."

They formed in loess mixed with residuum and colluvium from Columbia River basalt or Seven Devils volcanics.  Elevation is 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The subhumid climate has moderately dry summers. Average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches. Average annual temperature is 45 degrees to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 110 to 140 days."
