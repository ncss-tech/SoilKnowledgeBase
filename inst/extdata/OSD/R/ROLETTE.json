Olga soils are on nearby sloping and hilly valley sides and uplands.  Barnes, Bottineau, Buse and Waukon soils are on nearby till plains and are fine-loamy.  In addition, Waukon soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Brantford and Vang soils have formed in nearby outwash sandy-skeletal.  Kelvin soils formed in nearby till and do not have mollic epipedons.  Nutley soils have formed on nearby glaciolacustrine plains and do not have argillic horizons.  Rolla soils are on nearby glaciolacustrine plains and do not have mollic epipedons.  Walsh soils have formed in nearby glacial outwash containing a high percentage of shale particles and are fine-loamy."
