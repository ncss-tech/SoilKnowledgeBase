Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,160 to 1,590 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and hot, intermittently moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 150 to 180 days."
