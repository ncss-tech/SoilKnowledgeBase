  "OVERVIEW": "The Rakane series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The Rakane soils are on old dissected terraces and terrace sideslopes.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Arbidge and Ochoco soils have duripans less than 10 inches thick.  Dacker soils have a silty clay loam argillic horizon.  Debab and Womack soils have a loamy skeletal layer between the argillic and the pan.  Deerlodge and Exel soils have hues redder than 10YR in the argillic horizon.  Ditchcamp, Snowmore, and Wendell soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Lembos soils are slightly to moderately calcareous in the argillic horizons.  Madras soils have 10 to 30 percent pumice fragments above the pan, and are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Idow soils have Bk horizons.  Wako soils have E horizons.  Wellsed soils are strongly or very strongly alkaline in the soil layer between the argillic and the duripan."
