Arbidge and Ochoco soils have duripans less than 10 inches thick.  Dacker soils have a silty clay loam argillic horizon.  Debab and Womack soils have a loamy skeletal layer between the argillic and the pan.  Deerlodge and Exel soils have hues redder than 10YR in the argillic horizon.  Ditchcamp, Snowmore, and Wendell soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Lembos soils are slightly to moderately calcareous in the argillic horizons.  Madras soils have 10 to 30 percent pumice fragments above the pan, and are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Idow soils have Bk horizons.  Wako soils have E horizons.  Wellsed soils are strongly or very strongly alkaline in the soil layer between the argillic and the duripan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 3,000 to 4,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The average annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F., and the frost free season is 120 to 140 days."

Chuska and Yahoo soils are shallow to a duripan.  Purdam soils have fine-silty control sections.  Dolman and Sluka soils have coarse-silty control sections, and do not have argillic horizons.  All of the above soils are on the same land form as Rakane soils.  Tulch soils have fine-silty control sections, do not have argillic horizons or duripans, and are on lower terraces and along larger drainageways."
