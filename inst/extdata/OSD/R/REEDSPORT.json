  "OVERVIEW": "The Reedsport series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary rock. Reedsport soils are on side slopes, benches, and rounded ridgetops of mountains. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is 5 to 9 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is from 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. It has 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent sandstone parafragments. Organic matter is 5 to 12 percent. Soil reaction is moderately to strongly acid.  It is medial loam and has ammonium-oxalate extractable Al +  1/2Fe of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, a phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, and a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc.\nThe A2, or AB horizon, when present, has ammonium-oxalate extractable Al +  1/2Fe of 1.0 to 3.0 percent, a phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, and a moist bulk density of 0.80 to 1.00 g/cc.\nThe Bw1 horizon has ammonium-oxalate extractable Al+1/2Fe of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, and moist bulk density of 0.80 to 1.00 g/cc.\nThe Bw2 and Bw3 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry.  It is loam and clay loam with 5 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 15 to 65 percent sandstone parafragments. It averages 20 to 35 percent clay. It is very strongly to strongly acid.  Organic matter is 2 to 7 percent."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum dominantly from sedimentary rock with some areas of metasedimentary or metavolcanic in origin. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The frost-free period is 120 to 270 days."

If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties."
