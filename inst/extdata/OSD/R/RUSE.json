  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Cobble or flagstone content ranges from 0 to 20 percent throughout. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 30 percent in the A horizon and from 0 to 15 percent in the remainder of the pedon.  Rock fragments are primarily limestone.\nSome pedons have a thin muck surface, less than 4 inches thick over the mineral soil material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam or the mucky, gravelly or cobbly analogues of textures. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or the gravelly or flaggy analogues of these textures. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or the gravelly or flaggy analogues of these textures. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nA thin calcareous C horizon is in some pedons.  The upper 1 to 4 inches of the bedrock is weathered in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ruse soils are on nearly level areas and in depressions of lake benches and ground moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in glacial till of Wisconsinan Age, over Ordovician, Devonian, or Silurian limestone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F."

The Longrie, Summerville, and Sundell soils are well drained and in higher landscape positions. Ensign soils are somewhat poorly drained and are in slightly higher landscape positions. Angelica, Chippeny, and Nahma soils are poorly drained associates found on similar landscape positions. Angelica soils are very deep to bedrock, Chippeney soils are organic soils and Nahma soils are moderately deep to bedrock."
