  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 49 to 54 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from about 67 to 73 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock and the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Fine and coarser sands comprise 50 percent or more of the fine-earth fraction.  Content of rock fragments throughout the profile ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  Rock fragments are mainly pebbles and cobbles; however, a few stones may be present in some pedons.  The moisture control section in most years is dry in some part more  than one-half the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but in most years it is moist in some part more than 60 consecutive days in April through September.  It is usually moist in some part throughout the spring season.  Reaction is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Rock fragment content by volume is 35 to 75 percent.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Textures are very gravelly sandy clay loam, extremely gravelly clay loam, or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 to 52 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 11 to 14 inches.  The average frost-free period is about 130 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision updates the classification from a Lithic Ustollic subgroup to be compatible to the 1994 Amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil include:  an ochric epipedon; an argillic horizon from 2 to 11 inches; a Bkm horizon from 11 to 12 inches; over 35 percent rock fragments in the texture control section; a lithic contact at 12 inches; an ustic aridic moisture regime; and a mesic temperature group.  Last updated by the state 4/88.  Entered on OSED file 8/95.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
