  "OVERVIEW": "Roygorge series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from gneiss, sandstone, and granite on mountain slopes and footslopes of mountains.  Slope ranges from 5 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 310 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
