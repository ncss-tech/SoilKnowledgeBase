  "OVERVIEW": "The Risley series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from altered andesite, shale and sandstone.  Risley soils are hillsides, mountains and rock pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
