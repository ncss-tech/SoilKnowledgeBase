These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from altered andesite and other basic volcanic rock or shale, and sandstone.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,070 to 2,080 meters.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 300 mm; the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 100 to l20 days."
