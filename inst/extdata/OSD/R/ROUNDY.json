  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 24 inches thick or less and organic matter decreases regularly with increasing depth. The upper boundary of the argillic horizon is deeper than 24 inches.  The textural change from the A2 to the B2t horizon exceeds 20 percent increase in clay, with an abrupt boundary.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at 20-inch depth is about 58 degrees F.   The soils are usually moist and are dry less than 90 cumulative days in some subhorizon. Commonly, an organic layer of leaf litter 0 to 3 inches thick occurs on the surface.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is cobbly or very cobbly very fine sandy loam and has 40 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, dominantly 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is cobbly clay or cobbly heavy clay loam and has more than 35 percent clay.   Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent cobbles and stones in the upper part and increase to 70 percent in the lower part adjacent to the underlying fractured bedrock.  Structure in the B2t horizon ranges from strong coarse to medium angular blocky. Reaction is strong or medium acid.\nThe underlying fractured sandstone has cracks and crevices filled with material similar to the B2t horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baird Hollow, Bear Basin, Clayburn, Everman, Flygare and Scave series.  All of these soils except Scave lack the abrupt textural change at the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  Bear Basin and Clayburn soils have argillic horizons with less than 35 percent clay and with the upper boundary within 24 inches of the surface.  Clayburn soils lack A2 horizons.  Flygare soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick and argillic horizons containing less than 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Scave soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roundy soils occur on sloping to very steep mountain slopes with slope gradients of 5 percent. They formed in residuum, colluvium and alluvium from mixed sedimentary parent rocks.  Elevation ranges from 6,500 feet on steep north exposure to 8,500 feet on other exposures. The climate is humid with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 35 inches falling mostly as snow.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 F. and the mean summer temperature is about 58 F.  Frost-free period is about 50 to 80 days."

Cluff soils lack a mollic epipedon and have argillic horizons containing more than 35 percent rock fragments and with the upper boundary within 24 inches of the surface.  Daybell soils lack argillic horizons and have very gravelly loamy sand control sections with fines too few to fill the voids."
