These soils receive runoff from surrounding uplands and are moist for longer periods than normal for the climate.\nThe soil cracks and is dry in some or all parts of the upper 51 cm (20 in) for more than 90 cumulative days in normal years. July through August and November through March are the driest months. These soils are intermittently moist in September through October and April through June.

Distance between the center of the microhigh and the center of the microlow is about 1.5 to 4.6 m (5 to 15 ft). The microhigh makes up about 20 percent, the intermediate, or area between the high and low, about 40 percent, and the microlow about 40 percent. Cracks open and close each year, except during higher than normal rainfall years and remain open for 90 or more cumulative days during most years. When dry, 1 to 5 cm (0.4 to 2 in) wide cracks extend from the surface to a depth of 102 cm (40 in) or more. Cracks are more prominent in the microlows. COLE is more than 0.07.

It includes knotgrass, bur ragweed, sedges, spike rushes, smartweed, saltmarsh aster, curly dock, frog-fruit, and bushy knotweed. In areas of standing water longbarb arrowhead, soft-stem bulrush, and southern cattail may be present. Around the margins, where ponding occurs for shorter periods the woody vegetation includes western willow and some saltcedar. This soil has been correlated to the Playa (077CY027TX) range site in MLRA-77."
