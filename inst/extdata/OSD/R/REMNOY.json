  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a duripan composed of silica and carbonates, ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  Remnoy soils are usually effervescent throughout.  The carbonates are disseminated or segregated in filaments, soft masses, or concretions.  The upper part of the A horizon, the E horizon, and the lower part of the C horizon are noneffervescent in some pedons. Reaction is strongly alkaline to very strongly alkaline. It is saline-sodic below the E horizon.\nFew to many fine or medium distinct redoximorphic iron concentrations occur in the Btn horizon, the duripan, and the C horizon.  They have moist color of 5Y 6/3, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/4; 10YR 5/6, 4/6, 3/6; or 5YR 4/6.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 6/2, 7/1 or 7/2. The texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Clay content is 8 to 25 percent.  This horizon has strong thin, medium, or thick platy structure.  The organic carbon is less than 0.5 percent.\nThe E horizon tongues into the Bt horizon and between prism faces in some pedons.\nThe Btn horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 7/2; or 10YR 7/3 and moist color of 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 4/4; or 10YR 4/3.  It is clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent clay.  This horizon has weak to strong, medium or coarse, prismatic or columnar structure that parts to subangular blocky.  There are continuous or moderately thick clay films in pores and on ped faces.  The sodium adsorption ratio ranges from 13 to 100.\nThe Bqkm horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 6/2 or 7/2.  The duripan contains 10 to 20 percent carbonates.  It is not fractured in some pedons.\nThe lower part of the C horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 7/2, 6/2, 6/4 or 7/4.  It is stratified sandy loam to silt loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Remnoy soils occur on alluvial fans, terraces, and flood plains at elevations of 190 to 300 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from granitic and sedimentary rocks.  The climate is arid, and has hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 8 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 81 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 275 days."
