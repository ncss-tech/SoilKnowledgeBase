These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 7 to 24 inches and has a moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic ash content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock (lithic) is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is gravelly ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy loam. It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  It has 25 to 50 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."

Brevco, Huntrock, Kamela, Redpeak, Santop, and Thout soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Coxit, Jimbluff, and Ontrail soils are very deep.  Highhorn soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Longort soils are moderately deep to densic material.  Jumpe soils are very deep.  Seeburg soils are very deep.  Lekrem soils are similar but have developed in granitic rock parent material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Radercreek soils are on upper backslopes of mountains at elevations of 3,350 to 4,900 feet.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and volcanic rock, with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F; the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F; and the average air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
