  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 30 to 45 inches. Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 15 to 30 inches.   Depth to bedrock ranges from 5 to 20 feet.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 10 to 35 percent in the till or residuum.   Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the soil. Redox features and saturation are in the albic or spodic horizon within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have a Bhs horizon. Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nSome pedons have a glossic horizon (2E/B or 2B/E horizon, or both). The 2E part has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy sand or sandy loam.  The 2Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR,value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Btg horizon has color and texture like the 2Bt part described above. Clay content of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 18 percent and the content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 15 to 50 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs."

Gaastra, Gastrow, and Zeba soils are not sandy in the upper part of the series control section and, in addition, Zeba soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rockers soils are on stream terraces and on broad areas along drainageways of uplands underlain by igneous and metamorphic bedrock.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in a sandy mantle and in loamy glacial till or the underlying loamy residuum or a mixture of the two.  The glacial stratigraphy in the area where these soils occur has not been fully worked out.  The till is derived mainly from the local residuum.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dancy, Guenther, and Mosinee soils.  The well drained Guenther and Mosinee soils and the poorly drained Dancy soils form a drainage sequence with the Rockers soils.  Guenther soils are nearby in more sloping sandy areas.  Mosinee soils are on nearby sloping areas, but do not have a spodic horizon.  Dancy soils occupy the large drainageways and depressions."

Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow in the till or residuum.  These soil have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 0.5 to 1.5 feet for some time in most years."
