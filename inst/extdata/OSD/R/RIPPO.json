The epipedon is too thin to meet Follistic or mollic epipedon criteria.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 10 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: 60 to 85 percent, mainly gravel in the upper and cobbles and stones in the lower part. Lithology of the fragments is mainly limestone and quartzite.\nA horizons - Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nOrganic matter content: 2 to 4 percent.\nReaction: Slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nBC and C horizons - Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nTexture: Loam or sandy loam; Texture modifiers are extremely stony or extremely cobbly.\nClay content: 10 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: 60 to 85 percent.\nStructure: Weak to moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky, or single grain.\nConsistence: Soft or slightly hard, dry.\nReaction: Neutral to slightly alkaline.\nOther features: Some pedons contain thin subhorizons with less than 60 percent rock fragments but when averaged it is 60 to 80 percent."

Elevations range from 2,240 to 2,750 meters.  The climate is dry-subhumid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm. These soils receive additional run-on moisture making it wetter than the precipitation zone would indicate. Mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C. The frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
