These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone or mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm dry, summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 3050 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 22 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days."
