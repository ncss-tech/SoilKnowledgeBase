  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to phyllite, slate, or siltstone rock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Amount of coarse fragments of phyllite, slate, or siltstone in various stages of weathering averages between 10 and 35 percent by volume in the A horizon and between 35 and 65 percent in the B horizons.  Size of the fragments ranges from about 1 inch to 12 inches long, and from less than 1 to about 3 inches thick.  Some of the fragments are soft enough to crush between the fingers.  The silt and sand fractions are more than 30 percent weatherable minerals consisting chiefly of sericite and chlorite.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A1 horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2).  The A2 horizon and Ap horizon in the few cultivated areas, is brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3) or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4).  The fine-earth fraction is silt loam.  Structure of the A horizon is moderate, weak medium granular, rarely weak medium, or fine subangular blocky.\nThe B2 horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), or brown (7.5YR 4/4, 5/4).  The fine-earth fraction is silt loam or rarely silty clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, medium or fine subangular blocky.  The B2 horizon is dominantly a cambic horizon, but some part of each pedon has sufficient illuviated clay, as evidenced by clay films and clay increase, for an argillic horizon.  The argillic part is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), or rarely yellowish red (5YR 5/6) silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe B3 horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6) or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) channery silt loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Armuchee, Goldston, Litz, Louisa, Louisburg, and Steekee series.  Armuchee, Louisa, Louisburg, and Steekee soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments and have average annual temperatures more than 59 degrees F.  In addition, Steekee soils have reddish colors and sandy loam and loam textures.  Goldston soils have siliceous mineralogy and average annual temperature more than 59 degrees F.  Litz soils have thinner sola and a paralithic contact with shale.  In addition, the argillic horizon portion of Litz soils has a higher clay content than that of Ranger soils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevation ranges from about 1,200 to 3,500 feet above sea lever.  These soils formed in rescuum from phyllites, slates, rhyolites, and siltstones.  They are in areas having about 50 to 57 degrees F. average annual temperature, and about 54 inches average annual rainfall."
