Irock, Mokiak, and Salas soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact.  Majada and Purcella soils have calcic horizons.  Montoso soils are influenced by pyroclastic materials and have cinders within 40 inches.  Murdo and Willowman soils are less than 20 inches to the base of the Bt horizon.  Nederland soils lack horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation."
