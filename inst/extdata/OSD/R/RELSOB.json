  "OVERVIEW": "The Relsob series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived primarily from noncalcareous sandstone.  These soils are on fan aprons and toeslopes of hills and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  EC is less than 2 mmhos throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline (pH 6.6-8.0.)\nThe Bt (argillic) horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam with clay ranging from 20 to 35 percent, silt from 0 to 28 percent, and sand from 45 to 80 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 20 percent and are fine or very fine pebbles.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture of the matrix is sand or loamy sand modified with 0 to 60 percent fine pebbles.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Relsob soils are on relict fan aprons and toeslopes of hills and ridges.  These soils formed in alluvium derived primarily from noncalcareous sandstone.  The finer sediments overlie strata of sand or gravel and sand mixtures.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent and typically simple.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and ranges from 10 to 14 inches with about half falling as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. and ranges from about 34 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated at 80 to 110 days; but, because of elevation, aspect, and air drainage, frost may occur at any time."
