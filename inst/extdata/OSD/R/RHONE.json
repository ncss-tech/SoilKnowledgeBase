  "OVERVIEW": "The Rhone series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from hard fine-grained sandstone.  Rhone soils are on upland ridges and mountainsides.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 34 to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 51 to 58 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 40 inches thick.  The C horizon is normally very channery sandy clay loam or loam with 35 to 45 percent channery material and occurs between a depth of 20 and 40 inches.  Rock fragments range up to 60 or more percent in the lower parts of some pedons.  This soil is noncalcareous and is usually neutral, but ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section is loam or sandy clay loam and has 18 to 30 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.   Depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches, but usually is within 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have Bw horizons (cambic horizons).\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4."

Adel and Lamphier soils have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments throughout the profile.  Bullrey soils have a cambic horizon and formed in rhyolite or similar materials.  Gallatin soils are calcareous, somewhat poorly drained and have a seasonal water table.  Idmon soils are on flood plains and are underlain by sand and gravel below a depth of about 30 inches.  Karlan, Lespate, Secondset, Strickland, and Winevada soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Leavittville, Mundos, and Osmund soils have Ck horizons.  Pavohroo soils have a Bw horizon and formed in loess-covered limestone, colluvium, and residuum.  Taterheap soils have skeletal material below 40 inches.  Duff soils lack skeletal material at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Hackwood soils have an average of 15 to 35 percent pebbles in the particle-size control section."
