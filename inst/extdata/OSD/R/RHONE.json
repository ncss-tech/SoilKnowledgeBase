    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 34 to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 51 to 58 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 40 inches thick.  The C horizon is normally very channery sandy clay loam or loam with 35 to 45 percent channery material and occurs between a depth of 20 and 40 inches.  Rock fragments range up to 60 or more percent in the lower parts of some pedons.  This soil is noncalcareous and is usually neutral, but ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section is loam or sandy clay loam and has 18 to 30 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.   Depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches, but usually is within 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have Bw horizons (cambic horizons).\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4."

Adel and Lamphier soils have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments throughout the profile.  Bullrey soils have a cambic horizon and formed in rhyolite or similar materials.  Gallatin soils are calcareous, somewhat poorly drained and have a seasonal water table.  Idmon soils are on flood plains and are underlain by sand and gravel below a depth of about 30 inches.  Karlan, Lespate, Secondset, Strickland, and Winevada soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Leavittville, Mundos, and Osmund soils have Ck horizons.  Pavohroo soils have a Bw horizon and formed in loess-covered limestone, colluvium, and residuum.  Taterheap soils have skeletal material below 40 inches.  Duff soils lack skeletal material at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Hackwood soils have an average of 15 to 35 percent pebbles in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rhone soils are on upland ridges and mountainsides.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent and are slightly concave in many locations.  The soil formed in material weathered from fine-grained sandstone.  Elevation ranges from 7,600 to 8,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 32 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is less than 80 days."
