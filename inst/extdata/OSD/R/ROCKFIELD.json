The poorly drained Cyclone soils have a darker colored surface layer and are in depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Fincastle and Starks soils have redoximorphic features in the upper part of the subsoil and are on slightly lower lying landscape positions. Miami soils have thinner layers of silty material over till and typically are on more sloping areas in the landscape. Rainsville soils are on similar landscape positions and have more sand in the upper part of the solum. Williamstown soils have sola less than 102 cm (40 inches) thick and are on similar landscape positions."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table is 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and low or moderately low in the dense till substratum. Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy sediments, moderately slow in the lower part of the solum formed in till, and slow or very slow in the dense till substratum."
