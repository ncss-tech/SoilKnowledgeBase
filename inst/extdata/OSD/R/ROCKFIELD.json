  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockfield series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep to dense till. The Rockfield soils formed in silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash and till. They are on terraces and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
