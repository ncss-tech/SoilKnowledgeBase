  "OVERVIEW": "Ranes series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on relict alluvial terraces.  Ranes soils formed in a thin volcanic ash mantle over alluvium from mixed but dominantly mafic igneous rocks. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.",
