  "OVERVIEW": "The Reilloc series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium and  residuum derived from basalt over bedrock. Reilloc soils are on plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
