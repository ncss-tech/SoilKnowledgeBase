  "OVERVIEW": "The Rocio series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial and colluvial deposits derived from sandstone and shale.  Rocio soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 690 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
