The mean annual precipitation varies from 12 to 20 inches. Annual snowfall is 20 to 40 inches.  Mean July temperature varies from 65 to 68 degrees F; mean January temperature varies from 30 to 32 degrees F; mean annual temperature varies from 47 to 49 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 80 to 100 days."
