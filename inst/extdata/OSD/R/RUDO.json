  "OVERVIEW": "The Rudo series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess mixed with residuum and colluvium weathered from granitic schist on canyon side slopes. Permeability is moderately slow and the slopes range from 30 to 65 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
