  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise noted the entire range of properties permissible for the diagnostic horizons or the subgroup and family are permissible for the series.  Depth to uniformly calcareous mate4rial normally ranges from 0 to 6 inches but should not be deeper than the upper boundary of the B2 horizon.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and there should be no subhorizon more than 4 inches thick above 20 inches that exceeds this limit.  Weighted average gypsum content of the control section ranges from o to 5 percent and a majority of subhorizons above 10 inches should not exceed 3 percent.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is typically a loam or clay loam but clay may range from 18 to 35 percent, slit from 20 to 55 percent and sand from 20 to 60 percent with less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the major part of the control section.  Coarse fragments ranging from 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter predominate.  Mottling not due to segregated lime ranges from non to a few faint mottles but if the soil is mottled at all the chroma of the matrix material must exceed 2.\nColor of the A horizon may range in hue from 5YR to 10R in value from 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 6 moist, and in chroma from 1 to 4.  Reaction normally ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution organic dye).\nColor of the B2 horizon may range in hue from 5YR to 10R in value from 5 to 7 dry or 4 to 6 moist; and in chroma from 1 to 6.  Reaction normally ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution organic dye)\nHue of the C horizon may range from 5YR to 10R.  Reaction normally ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution organic dye).  Calcium carbonate in the Cca horizon ranges from 4 percent to 14 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Rickman series occurs on gently to moderately sloping hills and ridges.  Slopes typically range about 2 percent to about 20 or more percent.  The soil is developing on moderately thin calcareous, medium to moderately fine textured materials weathered from reddish brown shales and loamstones.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F., mean summer air temperature is 59 degrees F., mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is 60 degrees F."
