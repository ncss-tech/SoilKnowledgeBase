  "OVERVIEW": "The Redmore series consists of deep to a duripan, moderately well drained soils on hills on plateaus.  They formed in loess and material weathered from basalt.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 1 to 6 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",
