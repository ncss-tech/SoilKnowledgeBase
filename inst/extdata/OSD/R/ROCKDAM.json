  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockdam series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in siliceous sandy alluvium or residuum on pediments and stream terraces.  Permeability is rapid or very rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.  Redox features are within 72 inches and are within 40 inches in some pedons.  Saturation for 1 month or more per year in 6 out of 10 years occurs below 40 inches.  Some pedons are saturated within 40 inches for less than 1 month per year or less than 6 out of 10 years, or both.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  It is partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3..\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is sand or coarse sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4.  It is sand or coarse sand.\nThe Bw or BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sand or coarse sand.  Bw or BC horizons with spodic color have pH greater than 5.9 or have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.

Arbutus soils have a lithic contact of igneous or metamorphic bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and do not have a water table.  Croswell, Friendship, and Halfaday soils have mixed mineralogy.
