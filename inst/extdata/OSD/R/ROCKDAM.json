  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of sandstone gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.  Redox features are within 72 inches and are within 40 inches in some pedons.  Saturation for 1 month or more per year in 6 out of 10 years occurs below 40 inches.  Some pedons are saturated within 40 inches for less than 1 month per year or less than 6 out of 10 years, or both.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  It is partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3..\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is sand or coarse sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4.  It is sand or coarse sand.\nThe Bw or BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sand or coarse sand.  Bw or BC horizons with spodic color have pH greater than 5.9 or have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is sand or coarse sand."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Arbutus series.  Similar soils are the Croswell, Friendship, and Halfaday series.  Arbutus soils have a lithic contact of igneous or metamorphic bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and do not have a water table.  Croswell, Friendship, and Halfaday soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Friendship soils do not have a spodic horizon and Halfaday soils have a Bhs horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rockdam soils are on pediments and stream terraces.   Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in siliceous sandy alluvium or residuum.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1400 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Ironrun soils and the poorly drained Ponycreek soils form a drainage sequence with the Rockdam soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Fairchild soils and the moderately well drained Ludington soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the siliceous sand is underlain by interbedded sandstone and shale at 20 to 40 inches."
