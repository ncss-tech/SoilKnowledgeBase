  "OVERVIEW": "The Raingage series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in earthflow colluvium derived from mudstone and sandstone. Raingage soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
