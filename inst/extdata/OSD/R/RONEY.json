Catelli soils have an average annual soil temperature of 56 to 58 degrees F. Deerrun soils have O horizons and A horizons with less than 15 percent rock fragments. Ginnis soils are dry 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice and have a paralithic contact. Shangland soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have a paralithic contact. Texascreek soils have a paralithic contact and O horizons."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 22 inches. The average annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 150 days."
