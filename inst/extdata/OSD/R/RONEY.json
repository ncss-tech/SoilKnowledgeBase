  "OVERVIEW": "The Roney series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent in foothills and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
