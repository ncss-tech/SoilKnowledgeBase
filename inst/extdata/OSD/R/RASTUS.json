    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt is 10 to 15 inches.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  There is an absolute increase in clay content of 15 to 30 percent between the A2 and 2Bt horizons.  Rock fragments are typically rounded.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry.  It has 50 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent gravel.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Btk, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry.  It has 50 to 60 percent clay.  It has 10 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe Bkqm horizon is indurated throughout or indurated in the upper few inches and strongly cemented below.  It is strongly or violently effervescent.\nThe 3C horizon is sandy loam or loamy sand with 35 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline."

Campcreek soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and are located on south-facing slopes. Skullgulch soils have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick and are located on north-facing slopes.  Marack soils are on adjacent lower terraces, and have a calcic horizon.  Wahstal soils are clayey-skeletal and shallow to a duripan."
