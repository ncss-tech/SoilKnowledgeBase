  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soft shale or calcareous sandstone occurs at depths of 15 to 20 inches . The mean annual soil temperature immediately above the bedrock ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F. The mean summer temperature ranges from 61 to 65 degrees F. The soils are usually moist when the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F., but are dry for 65 to 85 consecutive days during the summer.\nThe Al horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry. It ranges from cobbly loam to cobbly light clay loam, with 15 to 25 percent angular cobbles and 0 to 15 percent angular pebbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist. It ranges from cobbly loam, gravelly loam, or very gravelly loam to very gravelly clay loam, and has 30 to 70 percent rock fragments. This horizon ranges from 13 to 14 inches thick."
