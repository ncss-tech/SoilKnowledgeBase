  "OVERVIEW": "The Riveroad series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stream alluvium from mixed sources.  Riveroad soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
