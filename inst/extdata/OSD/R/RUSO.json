Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and has more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam and has more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Bw horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam containing up to 35 percent coarse fragments.  Some pedons have a 2Bk or 2BCk horizon.  They have properties similar to the Bk horizon, but have textures of loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or coarse sand containing up to 80 percent coarse fragments.  Some pedons have a loamy fine sand transition horizon above the 2Bk or 2C horizons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is coarse sand, loamy sand or sand containing up to 80 percent coarse fragments."

Bikeyah, Chrishall, Dotsero, Hedoes, Klizhin, Parshall and Tuntsa soils do not have stratified sand and gravel above depths of 40 inches.  Breece soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 40 inches.  Jarmillo soils are noncalcareous throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ruso soils are on level to moderately sloping outwash plains and stream terraces that dissect till plains.  Slopes are plane or slightly concave and gradients typically are less than 3 percent but range to 9 percent.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium over stratified sand and gravel.  The climate is semiarid.  Mean annual air temperature is from 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer."

Bowdle and Stady soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Manning soils have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick and are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Wabek soils are sandy-skeletal."

Where the soil has been previously correlated in association with residual landforms, it will be recorrelated in the future to the Manning series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station laboratory data SU72ND-28-4.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
