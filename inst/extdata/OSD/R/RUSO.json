  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruso series consists of very deep, well drained soils on outwash plains and stream terraces.  They are 24 to 40 inches to sand and gravel.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium over sand and gravel.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the substratum. Slopes ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and has more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam and has more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Bw horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam containing up to 35 percent coarse fragments.  Some pedons have a 2Bk or 2BCk horizon.  They have properties similar to the Bk horizon, but have textures of loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or coarse sand containing up to 80 percent coarse fragments.  Some pedons have a loamy fine sand transition horizon above the 2Bk or 2C horizons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is coarse sand, loamy sand or sand containing up to 80 percent coarse fragments."

Slopes are plane or slightly concave and gradients typically are less than 3 percent but range to 9 percent.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium over stratified sand and gravel.  The climate is semiarid.  Mean annual air temperature is from 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer."
