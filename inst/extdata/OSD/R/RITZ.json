  "OVERVIEW": "The Ritz series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on flood plains and low stream terraces.  They formed in calcareous silty alluvium.  Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

Bane soils are on alluvial fans and are sandy and somewhat excessively drained.  Devoignes soils are in depressions on flood plains and have a histic epipedon.  Farnhamton soils are on natural levees on flood plains and are moderately well drained.  Pywell soils are in depressions on flood plains and are very poorly drained organic soils.  Schnoorson soils are in depressions on flood plains and are fine-silty."
