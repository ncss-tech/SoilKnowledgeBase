    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ritz soils are on low stream terraces and low ridges in a low ridge-swale complex of flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous silty alluvium.  Elevations range from 1,700 to 2,000 feet.  The climate characteristically has warm dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 28 inches and average annual air temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bane, DeVoignes, Farnhamton, Pywell, and Schnoorson soils.  Bane soils are on alluvial fans and are sandy and somewhat excessively drained.  Devoignes soils are in depressions on flood plains and have a histic epipedon.  Farnhamton soils are on natural levees on flood plains and are moderately well drained.  Pywell soils are in depressions on flood plains and are very poorly drained organic soils.  Schnoorson soils are in depressions on flood plains and are fine-silty."
