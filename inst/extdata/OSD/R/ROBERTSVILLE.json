  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 5 to more than 20 feet.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 15 to 36 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly to extremely acid except where lime has been added.  Fragments, mainly rounded pebbles, range from 0 to 5 percent in the A, Btg, and Btxg horizons and from 0 to 20 percent in the Cg horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The horizon has none to common redoximorphic features in shades of brown or gray. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The horizon has none to common redoximorphic features in shades of brown or gray.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  Texture is dominantly silt loam but the range allows silty clay loam.\nThe Btxg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral. Few to many redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is an evenly mottled pattern in these colors.  Texture is commonly silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay. Some pedons have layers of sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or clay."
