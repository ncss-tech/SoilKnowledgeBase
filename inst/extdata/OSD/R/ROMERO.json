  "OVERVIEW": "The Romero series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from schist or granitic rock.  Romero soils are on pediments, hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
