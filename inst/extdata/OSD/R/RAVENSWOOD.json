Derringer soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts. Droem, Leevan and Roostercomb soils have mollic epipedons that do not include the upper part of the argillic horizon. Also, Leevan soils have clay texture in the upper part of the argillic horizon and Droem soils have clay loam texture in all parts of the argillic horizon. McIvey, Threek, Urwil, Wilpar, Yago and Yeates Hollow soils are greater than 100 cm to bedrock. Snaresnout soils contain 60 percent or more rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Tickville soils have a typic xeric moisture regime."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ravenswood soils are on mountains. They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic and metamorphic rocks. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,829 to 2,438 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
