  "OVERVIEW": "The Richvale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium primarily from sandstone and limestone with loess influence. Richvale soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 405 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
