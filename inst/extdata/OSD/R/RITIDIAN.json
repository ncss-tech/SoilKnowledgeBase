  "OVERVIEW": "The Ritidian series consists of very shallow, well drained soils of moderately rapid permeability on limestone plateaus and escarpments.  They formed in slope alluvium, loess, and residuum from sediments overlying coralline limestone. Slopes range from 3 to 99 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",
