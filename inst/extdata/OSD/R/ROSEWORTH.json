Acana soils have greater than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand and are calcareous in part of the Bt horizon and the base of the Bt is 10 to 14 inches below the surface.  Argalt soils have bedrock at less than 20 inches.  Ayres, Chuckridge, Dewar and Handpah soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon.  Bartome and Grassval soils are mildly or moderately alkaline in the A horizon.  Bartome soils have the depth to the base of the argillic below 10 inches.  Grassval soils have gravelly Bt horizons.  Bruncan, Colthrop, and Packwood soils are underlain by bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches.  Chuska soils have loam and clay loam textures in the Bt horizon.  Pipeline soils have a duripan 12 to 18 inches thick, that is underlain by sand and gravel.  Thoms soils have clay loam textures, and hues of 5YR or 7.5YR in the Bt horizon.  Wellington soils have sandy loam or sandy clay loam Bt horizons."
