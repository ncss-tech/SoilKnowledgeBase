  "OVERVIEW": "The Razorba series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from hard, calcareous sedimentary rocks.  Razorba soils are on mountain sides and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon is 16 to 40 inches thick.  The soil is usually moist and is not dry for as much as 90 cumulative days in some subhorizons of the moisture control section.  The particle-size control section is moderately coarse textured, and has 12 to 18 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent (by volume) and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter.  The lower part of the control section has as much as 45 percent rock fragments in some pedons.   Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderately alkaline."

Ascab soils have a paralithic contact at 24 to 40 inches.  Cinderspring soils are leached of carbonates in the upper horizons and have rock fragments composed of cinders, and have cinders below 40 inches.  Coffeepot soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.  Coutis soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments and are slightly acid or neutral.  Earcree and Gardners Fork soils are noncalcareous and are neutral through moderately acid.  Foxvire soils lack carbonates throughout the profile.  Foxvire soils lack carbonates throughout the profile.  Hailman soils have a B2 horizon and a cobbly loam control section and are slightly acid or moderately acid.  Naz soils have 5 to 13 percent clay and contain less than 20 percent rock fragments.  Shook soils are noncalcareous in the upper horizons, have a Bw horizon, and have a high proportion of medium and coarse angular sand.  Moonlight soils have cambic horizons, lack carbonates throughout, and are moderately acid to neutral.  Skyway soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Taral soils lack carbonates throughout, have a subarctic continental climate with mean annual temperature of 23 to 27 degrees F.  Tosp soils lack carbonates throughout, are 40 to 60 inches deep over granitic bedrock, and average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the texture control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They are at elevations between 7,000 and 8,400 feet.  Slope gradients are 30 to 75 percent.  Parent material is marlstone or calcareous fine grained sandstone or shale.  The average annual precipitation ranges from about 18 to 22 inches, of which about one-half falls during the spring and summer.  The average annual temperature ranges from 37 to 41 degrees F., and the frost-free season is less than 75 days."
