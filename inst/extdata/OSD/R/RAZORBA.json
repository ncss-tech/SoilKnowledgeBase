  "OVERVIEW": "The Razorba series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from hard, calcareous sedimentary rocks.  Razorba soils are on mountain sides and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 510 mm and average annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

Ascab soils have a paralithic contact at 60 to 100 cm.  Cinderspring soils are leached of carbonates in the upper horizons and have rock fragments composed of cinders, and have cinders below 100 cm.  Coffeepot soils have a paralithic contact at 100 to 150 cm.  Coutis soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments and are slightly acid or neutral.  Earcree and Gardners Fork soils are noncalcareous and are neutral through moderately acid.  Foxvire soils lack carbonates throughout the profile.  Foxvire soils lack carbonates throughout the profile.  Hailman soils have a B2 horizon and a cobbly loam control section and are slightly acid or moderately acid.  Naz soils have 5 to 13 percent clay and contain less than 20 percent rock fragments.  Shook soils are noncalcareous in the upper horizons, have a Bw horizon, and have a high proportion of medium and coarse angular sand.  Moonlight soils have cambic horizons, lack carbonates throughout, and are moderately acid to neutral.  Skyway soils have a lithic contact at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Taral soils lack carbonates throughout, have a subarctic continental climate with mean annual air temperature of -5 to -3 degrees C.  Topsoils lack carbonates throughout, are 100 to 150 cm deep over granitic bedrock, and average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the texture control section."
