  "OVERVIEW": "The Rangertaft series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from quartzite. The Rangertaft soils are on mountain backslopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 570 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
