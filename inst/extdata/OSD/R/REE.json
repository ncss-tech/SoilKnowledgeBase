The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is loam but is silt loam or fine sandy loam in some pedons. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It commonly is clay loam but is sandy clay loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It has an average clay content of 27 to 35 percent.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part and slightly or moderately alkaline in the lower part.   Some pedons do not have carbonates as disseminated lime or few fine accumulations of carbonate in the lower part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  It has common to many accumulations of carbonates. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from sandy loam to clay loam, but some pedons have sandy materials, sand and gravel or clay materials at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Glenham, Gosper,Hennings, Houdek, Reventon, Verdigre, Wewela and Wineg series in the this family.  Glenham and Houdek soils formed in glacial till.  Gosper soils typically contain less clay in the argillic horizon and become more sandy with increasing depth.  Hennings soils have sandstone at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Reventon soils are drier in the soil moisture control section in May and June.  Verdigre soils do not have Bk horizons and have a paralithic contact of shale bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Wewela soils have shale bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Wineg soils have a drier climate."
