  "REVDATE": "07/2008",
  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Redpine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium over weakly consolidated ash, tuffaceous calcareous sandstone, and siltstone.  These soils are on backslopes and shoulders of hills.  Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes range from 8 to 25 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
