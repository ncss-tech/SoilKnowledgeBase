Beadle and Raber soils have clay loam or clay argillic horizons and formed in glacial till.  Brolliar soils have hard fractured Basalt between depths of 50 and 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).  Carlson, Harney, Mento, and Spearville have mean annual soil temperature greater than 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).  Carlson soils have hues that range to 7.5YR.  McClure soils have contrasting clayey substrata between depths of 50 and 100 centimeters (about 20 to 40 inches).  Mento soils have 5 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the B and C horizons.  Spearville soils typically have more clay in the argillic horizon."

Hoven and Scott soils are in depressions.  Scott soils are more moist and pond water.  Lowry soils have a coarse-silty control section and do not have an argillic horizon, and are on nearby landscapes. Millboro soils contain more clay in the series control section and typically are on landscapes below the Reliance soils.  Onita soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and are in swales. Promise soils are in similar nearby landscapes and have a very-fine textured control section."
