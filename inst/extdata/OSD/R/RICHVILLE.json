  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The Al horizon has throughout the upper 3 to 6 inches, moist value and chroma of less than 3.5. The texture in the section from depth of 10 inches to the Cr horizon ranges from loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Weathered tuffaceous sandstone occurs at depths of 28 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 67 to 68 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 85 consecutive days during the late summer. Rock fragments consist of quartzite pebbles and range from 0 to 30 percent in the Al and B2 horizons and 0 to 20 percent in the Cca horizon.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. It is loam or gravelly loam.  This horizon is moderately to strongly alkaline. It is 3 to 6 inches thick.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4. It is gravelly clay loam or loam, and is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, 4 through 6 moist. It is moderately or strongly calcareous and moderately or strongly alkaline, and is 11 to 30 inches thick. The Cr horizon consists of soft weathered tuffaceous sandstone that can readily be crushed and broken at all moisture conditions."
