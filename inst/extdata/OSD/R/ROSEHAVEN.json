The mean annual soil temperature is about 52 to 57 degrees F.   Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is clay loam of sandy clay loam, averaging 27 to 35 percent clay.  Faint to distinct coatings of clean sand and silt grains are common."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boomer, Centralia, Cherryhill, Cle Elum, Cohasset, Crozier, Fives, Holland, Hood, Hotaw, Kalama, Latourell, Musick, Speaker, and Varelum series.  Boomer soils have an argillic horizon with hue redder than 7.5YR.  Centralia soils have an epipedon with moist value of 2 or 3 moist, have concretions in the upper 20 inches of the soil, and lack coatings of clean silt and sand grains in the B horizon.  Cherryhill soils have an umbric epipedon, are dry for more than 90 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice, and lack coatings of clean silt and sand grains in the B horizon.  Cle Elum, Crozier, Hotaw, and Speaker soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Cohasset soils typically have hue redder than 7.5YR in the B horizon and lack the coatings of clean silt and sand grains in the B horizon.  Fives soils are strongly or very strongly acid in the lower part of the solum and C horizon, and commonly have hue of 5Y in the B and C horizons.  Holland soils have 20 to 30 percent coarse or very coarse sand and have very hard consistence.  Hood soils have a control section that is loam or silt loam and have 18 to 25 percent clay and lack rock fragments throughout.  Kalama soils have an argillic horizon 9 to 12 inches thick, lack the coatings of clean silt and sand grains on faces of peds in the argillic horizon, and have a very gravelly clay loam C horizon. Latourell soils have an argillic horizon with 18 to 22 percent clay and lack the coatings of clean silt and sand grains.  Musick soils have hue of 2.5YR.  Varelum soils are neutral or mildly alkaline throughout the argillic horizon, have 18 to 28 percent clay in the argillic horizon, and lack the coatings of clean silt and sand grains."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rosehaven soils are on rounded ridgetops, mountainsides and low foothills in  uplands.  Slopes are 3 to 90 percent.  Elevation is 400 to 2,500 feet.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from coarse grained sandstone, conglomerate sandstones and siltstone.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and dry warm summers with precipitation ranging from 30 to 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."
