    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Roche soils occur on hills and outwash plains. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift over dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevation is sea level to about 91 meters. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. The annual precipitation ranges from 455 to 765 millimeters. The average annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free period is 200 to 240 days."

Cady and Haro soils occur on adjacent bedrock controlled hills and have a lithic contact. Hoypus soils are on adjacent hills and outwash plains, are greater than 150 cm to a densic contact, and have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section. Killebrew and Mitchellbay soils are on hills of outwash plains, have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and redoximorphic features from 20 to 50 cm. Sholander soils occur in valleys and drainageways, have a densic contact at 100 to 150 cm, and a sandy particle-size control section."
