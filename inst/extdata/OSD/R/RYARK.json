The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  EC is less than 2 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Textures are loamy sand or sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt argillic horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 8 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are fine or very fine angular pebbles.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.

Canwall, Cotha, Means, Elk Mountain and Rohonda soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Farson soils have Bk horizons within 40 inches. Joemre soils have hue of 5YR and 2.5YR  and have a calcic horizon.  Ryan Park soils have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ryark soils are on nearly level, undulating and rolling, dissected relict alluvial fan aprons terraces, benches and plateaus.  These soils formed in coarse and moderately coarse alluvium derived primarily from sandstone, eolian materials, and residuum.  Slopes are both simple and complex and range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches of which about half falls as rain or snow in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 35 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from about 75 to 110 days.  Frost may occur in any month depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."

Relsob soils have over 18 percent clay in the Bt horizon and have a contrasting particle-size control section.  Relsob soils occur intermixed with the Ryark soils.  Zeomont soils are Psamments and occur in duned and hummocky areas associated with Ryark soils."
