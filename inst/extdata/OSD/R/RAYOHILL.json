  "OVERVIEW": "The Rayohill series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from gypsum rock. Rayohill soils are on knolls, alluvial fans and pediments. Slopes range from l to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about l2 inches and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
