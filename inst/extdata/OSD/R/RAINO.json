  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  The average clay content of the upper part of the control section is 18 to 30 percent but the lower part, or within 40 inches of the soil surface, the clay content range from 40 to 60 percent.  There is an absolute increase of 25 percent or more clay between the loamy upper part and clayey lower part with less than a 5-inch thick transitional layer separating the loamy and clayey horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  The reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Some pedons have an E horizon with chroma of 2 to 4.  The texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt/E horizons have (Bt) colors in shades of brown, gray, yellow, and red.  They are mottled with these colors but are not dominantly gray in the upper part.  The E materials are uncoated sand and silt with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Albic (E) materials comprise 15 to 30 percent of some part of the control section.  These materials are in the form of tongues, streaks and pockets.  The texture of the Bt/E1 horizon is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. The Bt/E2 horizon is sandy clay, silty clay, or clay.  The reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Btg horizons have colors in shades of gray, brown, yellow, and red, and are typically mottled with these colors.  The texture is mainly clay, but sandy clay or clay loam is included.  Uncoated sand and silt (E) typically comprise less than 5 percent by volume.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BCg horizon has colors mainly in shades of gray or brown with yellowish and reddish mottles.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid, however, some pedons are neutral below a depth of 60 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Other similar soils include the Alazan, Atasco, Bernaldo, Elysian, Fred, Freestone, Frizzell, Rader, Rodessa, Tippo, and Wanilla series. Alazan soils lack clayey materials in the lower part of the control section.  Atasco and Rodessa soils have fine textured control sections. Bernaldo and Freestone soils lack E soil material tonguing into the upper Bt horizon, and Bernaldo soils do not have gray mottles within the upper 30 inches of the solum.  Elysian soils lack gray mottles and clayey lower Bt horizons.  Fred, Frizzell, Tippo and Wanilla soils have silty control sections.  Rader soils lack contrasting textures in the control section and are dry for 90 days or more each year."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Raino soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces or remmants of terraces on erosional upland with slopes of 0 to about 2 percent.  The soil normally occupies mounds 30 to 200 feet in diameter and 1 to 3 feet above the intermound landscape.  The soil formed in clayey and loamy sediments many feet thick.  The soils have been reworked by wind.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 48 inches.  Frost free days range from 235 to 275 and elevation ranges from 250 to 450 feet above sea level.  The average annual temperature is 64 to 69 degrees F. and the Thornthwaite P-E index is 64 to 84."

Annona soils have red and gray mottled clayey upper Bt horizons.  Derly and Lufkin soils have grayish Bt horizons.  Bernaldo and Freestone soils are on slightly higher positions in the landscape.  Annona, Derly, and Lufkin soils are on similar positions, however, Annona soils are slightly higher in some associations.  These soils typically are on mounded surfaces with Raino on the mounds and Annona, Derly, and Lufkin soils below on intermound positions."
