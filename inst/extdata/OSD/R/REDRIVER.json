  "OVERVIEW": "The Redriver series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from basalt and volcanic ash.  Redriver soils are on lava flows and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 44 to 46 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil moisture control section (9 to 27 inches) is dry from August 1 to November 1 (90 days) and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from May 1 to December 1 and exceeds 47 degrees F from June 1 to November 1.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 10 percent stones, 1 to 10 percent cobbles and 15 to 30 percent gravel.  Most pedons have a clay increase from the A to B horizon but it is insufficient to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.  The 15 bar water content of the fine earth fraction ranges from 8 to 20 percent.  Acid-oxalate-extractable aluminum plus one half acid-oxlate-extractable iron ranges from 3.0 to 1.1 throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 4/2; 5YR 4/3 or 4/4.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2, 3/3 or 3/4.  It is stony sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam with 30 to 50 percent rock fragments and 5 to 12 percent clay.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.  Sodium fluoride pH is 10 to 11.  Bulk density ranges from 0.7 to 0.85 g/ccl.\nThe Bw horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6; 5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4 or 5/6. Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6; 5YR 3/4, 4/4 or 4/6.  It is very or extremely gravelly sandy loam or very or extremely cobbly sandy loam with 50 to 75 percent rock fragments and 8 to 15 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly or medium acid.
