(Bk and By horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm).  (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 16 inches (15 to 41 cm).  (Bk horizon)\nGypsic horizon:  The zone from 16 to 24 inches.  (By horizon)\nLithic contact:  The contact with sandstone at 24 inches (61 cm).  (R layer)\nThis soil occurs in a climatic 10 to 12 inch precipitation zone that is generally considered to be ustic aridic.  However, the vegetation is more indicative of a typic aridic soil moisture regime.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Soil Taxonomy 9th edition, 2003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
