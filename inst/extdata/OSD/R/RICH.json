    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum typically is 16 to 25 inches, but ranges from 16 to 32 inches.  The natric horizon has a sodium absorption ratio 13 to 50.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  A season water table is between the depths of 24 to 72 inches.  These soils are on a landscape position that receives additional water.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist or dry.  It is a silt loam or loam.  The A horizon has weak medium platy or subangular blocky structure.  It ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR, and the upper part has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  The lower part has value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 through 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  The B2t horizon is a clay or silty clay with 45 to 60 percent clay.  It has strong prismatic and subangular blocky structure.  The upper part ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline, and the lower part ranges from strongly to very strongly alkaline.  The lower part of this horizon has a sodium absorption ratio 13 to 50.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It commonly is loam or fine sandy loam, but in some pedons there are stratified layers of silt loam or sand."
