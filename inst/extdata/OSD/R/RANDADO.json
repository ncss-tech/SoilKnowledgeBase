  "OVERVIEW": "The Randado series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in noncalcareous loamy alluvium over calcareous loamy residuum. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad, low ridges on inland, dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) and annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in).",
