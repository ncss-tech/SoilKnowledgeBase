  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Appleseed (AZ), Goldroad (AZ, NV, CA), Hyder (AZ), Quilotosa (AZ) and Sunrock (AZ, CA, NV) series. Appleseed soils have calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 35 percent and form in limestone parent material over limestone bedrock. Goldroad and Quilitosa soils have granitic and metamorphic rock fragments and have lithic contacts over granite or metamorphic rocks. Hyder and Quilitosa soils have intermittent soil moisture for 20 days or more in summer, typical of the Sonoran desert. Hyder and Sunrock soils have rock fragments that are mostly volcanic in origin and lithic contacts over volcanic bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redneedle soils are on hills. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from calcareous sandstone conglomerate. Elevations are 1,400 to 2,300 feet. The climate is low latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; mean annual air temperature is 69 to 75 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 300 to 360 days."
