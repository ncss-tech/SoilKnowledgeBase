  "OVERVIEW": "The Ralton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified, calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on valley flood plains and have slopes that range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 43 centimeters (17 inches) at the type location.",
