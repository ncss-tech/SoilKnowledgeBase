  "OVERVIEW": "The Rader series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in slightly acid to alkaline clayey and loamy alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces and terrace remnants on inland dissected coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
