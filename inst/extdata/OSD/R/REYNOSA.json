  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to evident stratification is 30 to about 50 inches. Secondary calcium carbonate in the form of films and threads and masses occurs at depths of 14 to 34 inches.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam and has less than 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine sand.\nThe BC or C horizon has hue of 10YR value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. The average texture is silty clay loam or silt loam. Individual strata are 0.5 cm to 20 cm thick and range from clay to loamy fine sand inclusive. Visible secondary calcium carbonate in the forms of films, threads, masses and concretions range from scarcely evident to about 3 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Conalb, Guadalupe, Lagloria, and McAllen series. Conalb soils have carbonatic mineralogy. Guadalupe and McAllen soils are in the fine-loamy family. In addition, Guadalupe soils have a thermic temperature regime. Lagloria soils are in the coarse-loamy family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Reynosa soils are on nearly level to gently sloping areas on old stream terraces. The soils no longer receive sediments from stream overflow, and have developed weakly expressed structure. The soil formed in silty calcareous sediments several feet thick. Slope gradients are mostly less than 1 percent but range up to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 17 to 27 inches, mean annual temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F. Frost free days range from 250 to 270, and elevation ranges from 700 to 1200 feet. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 20 to 32."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Cameron, Harlingen, Lagloria, Laredo, Olmito, and Runn series. Cameron soils have a contrasting textural class of clayey over loamy control section. Harlingen, Olmito, and Runn soils are in the fine family. Laredo soils have a mollic epipedon. These soils occur on similar surfaces."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Use is primarily irrigated cropland, but some areas are used as dry cropland and rangeland, The main crops are cotton grain sorghum, and a wide variety of cool season vegetables. Native grasses consist of trichloris, little bluestem Texas wintergrass, and bristlegrass. Woody species include large mesquite trees, spiny hackberry, lotebush, blackbrush, and common hackberry."
