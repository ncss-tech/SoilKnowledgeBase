  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The soils of the Rosane series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  They are in concave positions on flood plains, terraces or low alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 310 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
