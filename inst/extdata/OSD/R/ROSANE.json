  "OVERVIEW": "The soils of the Rosane series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  They are in concave positions on flood plains, terraces or low alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches, thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches, and depth to the contrasting sand and gravel substratum ranges from 23 to 40 inches.  Typically these soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches and are noncalcareous in excess of 40 inches in all pedons.  The soil is 80 to 100 percent base saturated.  These soils have fluctuating water tables that rise to near the surface of the ground many times during most years.  Rock fragments in the upper part of the control section range from 0 to 15 percent by volume, and from 35 to 70 percent in the lower part.  The solum is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is typically strongly mottled in the lower part.  This horizon usually has granular or crumb structure, but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe B2g horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Usually it has subangular blocky structure and parts to granular or crumb, but is massive in some pedons.  This horizon is typically fine sandy loam with clay ranging from 8 to 18 percent.\nThe 2Cg horizon typically is not calcareous but is weakly calcareous below 40 inches in some pedons."

At the type location the average annual precipitation is approximately 12 inches, with a peak during the months of April through September.  The mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 51 degrees F."
