  "OVERVIEW": "The Reyab series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone.  Reyab soils are on flood plains, alluvial bottoms, terraces, and fan aprons and inset fans on fan piedmonts with slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
