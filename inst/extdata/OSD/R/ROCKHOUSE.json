  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on level flood plains of high gradient streams that drain igneous hills and mountains.  Slope gradients are usually less than 1 percent, but range to 3 percent.  They have developed in very gravelly, cobbly, and stony alluvium in which most of the coarse fragments are largely from igneous formations.  The elevation is 3,500 to 5,500 feet.  Annual rainfall ranges from 8 to 20 inches and annual air temperature 60 degrees to 70 degrees F."

Bigetty and Medley have fine-loamy control sections.  Boracho, Espy, and Mitre soils are shallow over a petrocalcic horizon.  Brewster and Mainstay are shallow over igneous bedrock.  Limpia soils have an argillic horizon and are clayey-skeletal.  Santo Tomas soils are loamy-skeletal."
