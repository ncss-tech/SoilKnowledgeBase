  "OVERVIEW": "The Rudeen series is a member of the loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid family of Aridic Calcixerolls. Typically, Rudeen soils have grayish brown extremely stony loam A1 horizons, light gray strongly calcareous channery loam Cca horizons, very pale brown very channery loam C horizons, and volcanic tuff bedrock at a depth of 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 degrees to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 59 degrees to 66 degrees f. The soils are usually dry but are continuously moist in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 days in late winter and spring.  Indurated volcanic tuff or rhyolite bedrock is at depths ranging from 20 to 40 inches. The control section between a depth of 10 inches and the bedrock is dominantly medium textured and contains more than 35 percent rock fragments, mainly volcanic tuff or rhyolite. The rock fragments range from angular gravel to channery fragments, angular cobbles, flagstones or stones. The mollic epipedon and the solum range from 7 to 14 inches thick. The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist. It ranges from weak platy in the upper few inches to weak subangular blocky in the lower part and parts to weak granular structure. Where mixed to 7 inches the A1 horizon is slightly or moderately calcareous but the upper few inches of some undisturbed pedons are noncalcareous. The calcic horizon is immediately below the mollic epipedon and contains 15 to 40 percent lime. The calcic horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The upper part of the Cca horizon has weak prismatic or weak or moderate subangular blocky structure."

Denay and Hondoho soils lack bedrock above a depth of 40 inches. Pandoah soils lack calcic horizons.  Swanner soils lack calcic horizons and have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches. Tickason and Wahtigup soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments and have no bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches."

The soils formed dominantly in residuum from volcanic tuff and rhyolite but the upper part may be influenced by loess. The semiarid climate has a mean annual precipitation of 11 to 13 inches including 2 to 4 feet of snowfall and a mean freeze-free period of 80 to 110 days."
