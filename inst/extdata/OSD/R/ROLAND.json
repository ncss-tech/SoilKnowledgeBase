They formed in alluvium from meandering rivers.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,300 to 2,500 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 8 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."

Nohokomeen soils are in an Aquandic subgroup and have ashy textural modifiers in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Skymo soils lack a cambic horizon and have a sandy particle-size control section."
