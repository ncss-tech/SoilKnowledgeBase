Pedon used for series is 94KS177011 (SS880-886).\nOccasionally, there are buried soils deeper than 178 centimeters (70 inches) that contain higher clay content than the series allows.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available from the Lincoln, Nebraska, National Soil Survey Laboratory on Pedons S53KS177891, (SS2001-2007) and S53KS177892, (SS2008-2015). Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory 95KS087002 (SS892-SS897), 95KS087002 (SS892-897) and 96KS149013 (SS1157-1162).\nModified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
