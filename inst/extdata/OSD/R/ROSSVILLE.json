  "OVERVIEW": "The Rossville series consists of very deep well drained soils. They formed in silty alluvium on flood plain-steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 91 centimeters (36 inches) at the type location.",
