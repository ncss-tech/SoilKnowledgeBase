  "OVERVIEW": "The Ravine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from shale.  Ravine soils are on plains, fans and pediments.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
