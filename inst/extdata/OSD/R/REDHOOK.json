  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Redhook soils are on vegetated beach areas along the coast above the high tide line. They formed in stone, gravel, and sand-sized deposits of marine coral, sea shells, and igneous rocks.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The climate is tropical semiarid.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 76 to 82 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cinnamon Bay, Glynn, Jaucas, Sandy Point, Solitude, and Sugar Beach soils.  Cinnamon Bay and Glynn soils are on higher alluvial fans and terraces.  In addition, Cinnamon Bay soils are fine-loamy and Glynn soils are clayey-skeletal.  Jaucas soils are on similar positions but have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Sandy Point and Sugar Beach soils are in slightly lower saline marshes, ponds, and flats adjoining the sea and are very poorly drained.  In addition, Solitude soils are fine-loamy and Sugar Beach soils are organic."
