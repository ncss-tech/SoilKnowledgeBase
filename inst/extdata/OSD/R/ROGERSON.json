  "OVERVIEW": "The Rogerson series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Rogerson soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",

Esmod soils have duripans that are more than 100 cm thick.  Fulstone soils have duripans that are 18 to 66 cm thick and have skeletal material under the duripan.  Grassycan soils have lithic contacts at depths of 18 to 36 cm.  Kunaton soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates above the duripan and have lithic contacts under the duripan at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Puls soils do not have AE horizons, have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the argillic horizon, and have lithic contacts at depths of 28 to 152 cm.
