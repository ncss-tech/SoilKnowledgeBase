  "OVERVIEW": "The Ribriver series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils which are deep to sandy outwash.  These soils formed mostly in loess or silty alluvium underlain by stratified sandy outwash on outwash plains and outwash terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to sandy outwash all range from 40 to 60 inches.  Clay content in the particle size control section averages from 18 to 25 percent and the content of fine sand or coarser averages less than 15 percent.  The ratio of coarse silt to fine silt ranges from 1.25 to 2.50 in the silty mantle.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy lower subsoil.  Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and 0 to 10 percent in the sandy outwash.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but it ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.  Free carbonates are absent to a depth of 80 inches.  Redoximorphic concentrations are within a depth of 40 inches.  Redoximorphic depletions are below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon in some pedons.  Saturation occurs within a depth of 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has a value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 6.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nRibriver soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt horizon (2Bt horizon in pedons without a loamy 2Bt horizon) with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy 2Bt horizon) has color like the 3Bt horizon described above.  It is typically stratified layers of sand or coarse sand or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly.  It averages more than 85 percent sand in the fine earth fraction."
