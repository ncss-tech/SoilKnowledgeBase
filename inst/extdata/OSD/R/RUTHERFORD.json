Bickmore soils have Btk horizons with 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Bluebell soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section.  Buena Vista soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.  Hawkinspeak soils have mean summer soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F.  Sweetmount soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 27 to 50 percent clay.  Woodhurst soils have an ustic moisture regime and are neutral or slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 1,985 to 2,350 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 380 to 510 mm, the mean annual temperature is 2.8 to 6.1 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 20 to 60 days."
