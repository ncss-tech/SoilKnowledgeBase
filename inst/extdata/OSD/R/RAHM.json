Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4 with redox accumulations and depletions.

The Rahm series is in a drainage sequence with the moderately well drained Woodmere soils. The well drained Huntington, McAdoo, and Nolin soils, the moderately well drained Lindside, and somewhat poorly drained Newark soils are on nearby, lower lying flood plains. The well drained Millstone, Wheeling, moderately well drained Sciotoville, and somewhat poorly drained Hatfield and Weinbach soils are on stream terraces."

The criteria for an \"aeric\" subgroup will be maintained as series differentia.\nAdditional data: Lab data available for this series: Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University, Station Bulletin No. 274, File No. JF7804; and S94IN123-012 at the National Soil Survey Center, Lincoln, NE."
