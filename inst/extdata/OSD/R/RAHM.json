Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 40 to 80 inches. The Ap and Bg horizons are neutral or slightly acid and the 2Bb, 2Bgb, and 2C horizons range from moderately acid to very strongly acid. This soil has an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth and/or has at least 0.2 percent organic carbon at a depth of 50 inches or below.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4 with redox accumulations and depletions. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Btgb, 2Btb or 2Bgb horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.

Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F."

The Rahm series is in a drainage sequence with the moderately well drained Woodmere soils. The well drained Huntington, McAdoo, and Nolin soils, the moderately well drained Lindside, and somewhat poorly drained Newark soils are on nearby, lower lying flood plains. The well drained Millstone, Wheeling, moderately well drained Sciotoville, and somewhat poorly drained Hatfield and Weinbach soils are on stream terraces."

The criteria for an \"aeric\" subgroup will be maintained as series differentia.\nAdditional data: Lab data available for this series: Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University, Station Bulletin No. 274, File No. JF7804; and S94IN123-012 at the National Soil Survey Center, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
