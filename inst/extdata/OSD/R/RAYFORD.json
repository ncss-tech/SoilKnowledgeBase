  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rayford series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable prairie soils that formed in material weathered from limestone conglomerate of Pennsylvanian age.  Rayford soils are on sloping to moderately steep side slopes of hills or on ridges on the north side of the Arbuckle Mountains in the Grand Prairie.  Slopes are 5 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F.",

The A11 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  Texture is cobbly loam, cobbly clay loam, or cobbly silty clay loam.  Content of limestone fragments range from 25 to 35 percent by volume.  About 10 to 15 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 15 to 25 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.\nThe A12 horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, cobbly clay loam, very cobbly clay loam, very cobbly silty clay loam, or cobbly silty clay loam.  Content of limestone fragments range from 45 to 55 percent by volume.  About 10 to 20 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 25 to 40 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.  Films and soft bodies of calcium carbonate make up 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe R layer is indurated limestone conglomerate.  It is tilted less than 20 degrees from horizontal."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Brewster, Eckert, Kiti, Lampshire, Palopinto, and Timhill series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are Aledo, Atascosa, Renish, Santo Tomas, Shidler, Volco, and Woodford series.  Aledo soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  Atascosa soils have B2t horizons.  Brewster, Eckert, Lampshire, and Palopinto soils are dry for longer periods during the year.  Kiti soils have an irregular boundary over limestone tilted more than 20 degrees from horizontal.  Renish and Shidler soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Santo Tomas soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and do not have a lithic contact.  Timhill soils have a wavy boundary over rhyolite tilted more than 20 degrees from horizontal.  Volco soils have a calcic horizon.  Woodford soils have siliceous mineralogy and are underlain with hard sandstone tilted more than 20 degrees from horizontal."
