  "BYREV": "Rev. GOW-BWR-MBW",
  "REVDATE": "09/2007",
  "STATES": "IL,OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Romeo series consists of very shallow, poorly drained soils which formed in loamy alluvium and are underlain by limestone or dolostone bedrock. These soils are on flood plains or benches. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam high in sand content. Coarse fragments comprise less than 15 percent by volume in the soil."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (48 to 55 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 1020 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 152 to 311 meters (500 to 1,020 feet) above sea level."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Because of the thinness of the soil, drainage cannot be assessed; however, soils are saturated with water at some period during the growing season and subject to flooding or ponding during spring months of most years. Generally the bedrock will not allow the water to pass downward, while in dry periods the soil is droughty. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability of the soils is moderate."
