The soils formed in slope alluvium from tephra of dominantly basalt origin and in various stages of weathering.  The paralithic contact ranges from moderately to strongly weathered basalt that has clay films and some manganese stains in cracks.  In some pedons soft tuff is in pockets over weathered basalt.  Elevations are 4,800 to 6,300 feet.  The lower elevations are found mainly on northeast slopes.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 to 30 inches.  Snowfall is 48 to 60 inches. Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 50 to 80 days."
