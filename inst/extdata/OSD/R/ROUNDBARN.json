The mean annual soil temperature is about 41 to 47 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from mid August until early November (90 to 100 days) and is moist in all parts from mid January until mid May.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.from mid May until mid November (185 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F. from early July until early October.  Base saturation ranges from 59 to 73 throughout.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 5 percent to a depth of 30 to 50 inches.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2; or 7.5YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/2.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Roundbarn soils are on mountain foot slopes and ridge tops.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in slope alluvium from tephra of dominantly basalt origin and in various stages of weathering.  The paralithic contact ranges from moderately to strongly weathered basalt that has clay films and some manganese stains in cracks.  In some pedons soft tuff is in pockets over weathered basalt.  Elevations are 4,800 to 6,300 feet.  The lower elevations are found mainly on northeast slopes.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 to 30 inches.  Snowfall is 48 to 60 inches. Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 50 to 80 days."
