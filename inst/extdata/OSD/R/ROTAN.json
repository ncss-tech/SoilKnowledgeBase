  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rotan series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium of the Quaternary age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (26 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
