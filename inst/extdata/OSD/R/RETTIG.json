  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rettig series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in materials from schist and gneiss that are high in mica with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 1,150 mm and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
