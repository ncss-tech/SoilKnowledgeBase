  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free calcium carbonate is 36 to 50 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 36 inches in thickness and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It typically is loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are clay loam averaging between 30 and 35 percent clay.  They are slightly acid or neutral. The Bt horizon typically has few faint to distinct mottles, but mottles are not in some pedons.\nThe Bt3 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Fine or medium accumulations and striations of calcium carbonate range from few to many.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a C horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Albinas, Garrett, Haxtun, Jarita, Keya, Prosper, Sampson, Woodly and Woonsocket series.  Albinas soils have free carbonate within a depth of 30 inches.  Garrett soils contain more sand and have redder hue.  Haxtun soils have sandy loam upper Bt horizon.  Jarita soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Keya soils do not have mottles above a depth of 40 inches and formed in loamy alluvium.  Prosper soils have thinner surface layers and contain free carbonate within depths of 36 inches.  Sampson soils have a high content of medium or coarse angular granitic sand.  Woodly soils have fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam Bt horizons averaging less than 27 percent clay.   Woonsocket soils contain more fine sand or coarser in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Renner soils are on gentle to moderately steep foot slopes or are in nearly level or gently sloping upland drains. Slopes are plane and slightly concave with gradients ranging from 0 to 25 percent.  Renner soils formed in glacial till or local alluvium from glacial till.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches."
