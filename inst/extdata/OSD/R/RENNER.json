  "OVERVIEW": "The Renner series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till or local alluvium from glacial till on footslopes and in upland drains.  These soils have moderate permeability in the solum and moderately slow permeability in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
