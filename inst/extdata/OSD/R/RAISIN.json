  "OVERVIEW": "The Raisin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Quaternary age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on high stream terraces. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
