    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum to the bottom of the argillic horizon is more than 5 feet thick.  The A horizons range in color from brown to yellowish red when dry.  They have hues of 7.5YR and 5YR, values of 4 or 5 and chromas of 6 to 8.  Moist colors are dark reddish brown in hues of 5YR with value of 3 and chroma of 4.  The texture is clay loam and gravelly or cobbly clay loam, structure is massive to weak granular and reaction is slightly acid.  The Bt horizon colors are yellowish red when dry.  They have 5YR hue, value of 5 and chromas of 6 to 8.  Moist colors are dark reddish brown with 5YR or 2.5YR hue, value of 3 and chromas of 3 and 4.  Textures are heavy clay loam and clay, structure is weak granular or massive, consistence is slightly hard to hard and reaction is medium acid to slightly acid."

The Aiken soils have loam A horizons and dark red (moist) clay Bt horizons that are very strongly acid in the lower part.  The Boomer soils are moderately deep, have gravelly loam A horizons and dark reddish brown (moist) gravelly clay loam Bt horizons.  The Melbourne soils have medium acid A horizons and strongly acid Bt horizons.  Rescue soils have reddish brown, medium acid loam A horizons and dark red and yellowish red (moist) medium acid sandy clay loam Bt horizons.  Sites soils have reddish brown A horizons and strongly acid, red clay Bt horizons.  Parrish soils have brown A horizons with chromas of 2 to 4 and a lithic contact to metasedimentary rock at depths less than 50 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Red Hill soils occur on strongly sloping to steep uplands under hardwoods and conifers.  Underlying rock is basic igneous and is metamorphosed in places.  Elevations range from 1000 to 2000 feet and the climate is subhumid mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 35 to 50 inches, with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.; average January temperature about 42 degrees F., and an average July temperature about 72 degrees F."
