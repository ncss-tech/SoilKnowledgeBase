They have hues of 7.5YR and 5YR, values of 4 or 5 and chromas of 6 to 8.  Moist colors are dark reddish brown in hues of 5YR with value of 3 and chroma of 4.  The texture is clay loam and gravelly or cobbly clay loam, structure is massive to weak granular and reaction is slightly acid.  The Bt horizon colors are yellowish red when dry.  They have 5YR hue, value of 5 and chromas of 6 to 8.  Moist colors are dark reddish brown with 5YR or 2.5YR hue, value of 3 and chromas of 3 and 4.  Textures are heavy clay loam and clay, structure is weak granular or massive, consistence is slightly hard to hard and reaction is medium acid to slightly acid."
