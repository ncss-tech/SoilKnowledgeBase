    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rattlegulch soils are on mountains and hills.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.   Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,075 to 2,595 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days"
