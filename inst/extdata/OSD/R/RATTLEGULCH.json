  "OVERVIEW": "The Rattlegulch series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks, with additions of eolian volcanic ash. Rattlegulch soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days"
