  "STATES": "MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rubicon series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy deposits on disintegration moraines, ground moraines, end moraines, kame moraines, lake plains, outwash plains, stream terraces, beach ridges, and sand dunes. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
