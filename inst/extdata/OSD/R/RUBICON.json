Duel and Ishpeming soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). East Lake and Sayner soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Hartwick soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Karlin soils have loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam textures in the upper part of the series control section. Kiva soils have 10 percent cobbles in the lower part of the series control section. Rousseau soils average more than 50 percent fine sand throughout the series control section. Sultz soils are stratified with loamy, or loamy and sandy material in the lower part of the series control section."

Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. The Rubicon soils formed in sandy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 911 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4.4 to 8.3 degrees C (40 to 47 degrees F)."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The majority of this soil is forested, including pine plantations. Some areas are idle cropland or in pasture. Only a very small proportion is used for small grains and hay crops. The native vegetation and present natural vegetation is dominantly red pine and quaking aspen with some eastern white pine and jack pine. Ground cover consists of blueberries, wintergreen, sweet fern, and bracken fern."
