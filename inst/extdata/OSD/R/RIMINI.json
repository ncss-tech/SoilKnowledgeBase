The soil is extremely acid to moderately acid throughout the profile.  It is sand or fine sand to a depth of more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section averages less than 5 percent silt plus clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is mixed white and black.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Thin discontinuous Bh horizons or dark Bh bodies are in the E horizon of some pedons.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The Bh horizon does not turn redder on ignition.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Many pedons have black or dark reddish brown spheroidal bodies.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 to 4."

Cententary soils have more than 5 percent silt plus clay in the particle-size control section and have a seasonal high water table at 3.5 to 5.0 feet.   Eglin soils have chroma of 3 or more in the E horizon.  Similar soils in other families are the Echaw, Hurricane, Kureb, Leon, and Lynn Haven series.  Echaw soils have a Bh horizon at 30 to 50 inches from the surface.  Hurricane soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 2 to 3.  Kureb soils do not have a continuous Bh horizon.  Leon and Lynn Haven soils are saturated with water during the wet season."

The soil formed in marine sands.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches, the average annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 70  degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 230 to 290 days.  Rimini soils commonly are on Wicomico, Sunderland, or Coharie surfaces."
