  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Railroad soils are on basalt lava flows and mountains. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from unspecified volcanics influenced by calcareous loess. Slope ranges from 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 2,500 to 5,000 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches; mean annual temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days."
