  "OVERVIEW": "The Railroad series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from unspecified volcanics influenced by calcareous loess. Railroad soils are on basalt lava flows and mountains. Slope ranges from 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
