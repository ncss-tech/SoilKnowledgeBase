  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosedell series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on lakeplains. These soils formed in loess overlying water worked glacial till overlying fine textured lacustrine material. Permeability is moderately slow or slow. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",
