  "OVERVIEW": "The Renwash series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium over glacial outwash on flood plains.  Permeability is very rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",
