  "OVERVIEW": "The Renol series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium weathered from quartzite, sandstone, latite, breccia, andesite, and other basic and intermediate igneous rocks.  Renol soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 4 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 68 to 71 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 50 to 60 percent of the time that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., at depth of 20 inches.  The solum has 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.  These soils are neutral to moderately alkaline and noncalcareous in the A and Bt horizons and strongly alkaline and strongly calcareous or very strongly calcareous below the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 to 3 moist and dry.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 50 percent by volume.  This horizon is very gravelly or very cobbly clay loam, and is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 70 percent.  Textures range from very gravelly sandy loam to extremely gravelly sandy loam to very gravelly clay loam."

Borvant, Pavant, Blackridge, Denmark, and Reebok soils have petrocalcic horizons at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Borvant, Sierocliff and Denmark soils have cabonatic mineralogy.

These soils formed in alluvium from quartzite, sandstone, latite, andesite, breccia, and other basic intermediate igneous rocks.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches.  GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dagor, Donnardo, Mountainville, and Sumine soils and the competing Borvant, Povant and Reebok soils.  Mountainville, Donnardo, Sumine, and Dagor soils lack petrocalcic horizons.  Dagor soils have mollic epipedons that are more than 20 inches thick."
