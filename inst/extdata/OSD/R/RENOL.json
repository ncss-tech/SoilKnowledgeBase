  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to hardpan is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 68 to 71 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 50 to 60 percent of the time that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., at depth of 20 inches.  The solum has 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.  These soils are neutral to moderately alkaline and noncalcareous in the A and Bt horizons and strongly alkaline and strongly calcareous or very strongly calcareous below the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 to 3 moist and dry.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 50 percent by volume.  This horizon is very gravelly or very cobbly clay loam, and is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 70 percent.  Textures range from very gravelly sandy loam to extremely gravelly sandy loam to very gravelly clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in this family but the Blackridge, Borvant, Denmark, Pavant, Pober, Reebok, and Sierocliff series are in similar families or subgroups.  Borvant, Pavant, Blackridge, Denmark, and Reebok soils have petrocalcic horizons at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Borvant, Sierocliff and Denmark soils have cabonatic mineralogy.  Pober and Denmark soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occur on alluvial fans at elevations of 5,200 to 6,400 feet.  Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from quartzite, sandstone, latite, andesite, breccia, and other basic intermediate igneous rocks.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches.  GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dagor, Donnardo, Mountainville, and Sumine soils and the competing Borvant, Povant and Reebok soils.  Mountainville, Donnardo, Sumine, and Dagor soils lack petrocalcic horizons.  Dagor soils have mollic epipedons that are more than 20 inches thick."
