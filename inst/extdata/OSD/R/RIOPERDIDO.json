  "OVERVIEW": "The Rioperdido series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium over gypsiferous eolian sands. These nearly level soils are on drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
