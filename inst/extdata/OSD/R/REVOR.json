Texture is gravelly loam, very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly loam.  Rock fragment content is 10 to 65 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkq horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value is 6 or 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma is 2 to 4.  Texture is very gravelly loam.
