  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abilene, Blanket, Dodson, McLain, Tenaga, and Wolco series in the same family.  Abilene and Blanket soils have a calcic horizon and do not have redoximorphic features in the lower part of the solum.  Dodson soils formed in more silty sediments, are underlain with Permian redbed materials, and do not have redoximorphic features in the lower part of the solum.  McLain soils occur on floodplains and are moist for longer periods.  Tenaga soils are dry for longer periods.  Wolco soils are deep to hard limestone bedrock and are moist for longer periods."

Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230 days and elevation ranges from 1,000 to 2,100 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices ranges from 32 to 44."
