  "OVERVIEW": "The Rubick series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from coarse-grained igneous and metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on ridges and sideslopes of mountains. Slopes are 25 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nConverted to metric, updated formatting, and O horizons were updated to start at zero. Competing series section was not updated. 9/2022"
