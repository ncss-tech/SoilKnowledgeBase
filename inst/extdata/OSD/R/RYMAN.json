    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon (pachic feature): The zone from 2 to 25 inches (A1, A2, and A3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 12 to 42 inches (part of the A2, the A3, C1, C2, C3, and part of the C4 horizon)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy: Series classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998\nThe 06/2002 revision changes the moisture regime subclass from ustic to typic udic. This was done during correlation of the Animas-Dolores soil survey. This is based on the plant community - the current schema places the quaking aspen/mountain snowberry plant community in the typic udic subclass. Other phases of Ryman with big sagebrush are no longer considered with the series concept.\nThe 06/2002 revision changes the clay mineralogy class from mixed to smectitic. This is supported by lab data from similar soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
