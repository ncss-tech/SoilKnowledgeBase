  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rodgerpeak soils occur on broad, gently convex to planar areas on ridges. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations are 816 to 848 meters (2675 to 2780 feet). The soils formed in residuum derived from quartz-mica schist. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 2290 to 2550 millimeters (90 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 13 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 8 to 13 degrees C (46 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 220 to 250 days."

The Ahpah and Lackscreek soils are 50 to 100 centimeters deep to a paralithic and lithic contact. The Coppercreek and Lackscreek soils have argillic horizons. Coppercreek soils are on ridge shoulders and bedrock concavities on the ridgetop. Ahpah soils are on rounded main and spur ridges and convex slopes. Lackscreek soils are on bedrock knobs."
