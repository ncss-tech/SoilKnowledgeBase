  "OVERVIEW": "The Rodgerpeak series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from quartz-mica schist. Rodgerpeak soils are on mountains and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2410 millimeters (95 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

The soils formed in residuum derived from quartz-mica schist. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 2290 to 2550 millimeters (90 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 13 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 8 to 13 degrees C (46 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 220 to 250 days."
