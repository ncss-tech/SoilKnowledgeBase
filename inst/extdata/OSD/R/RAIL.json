  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years the soil is saturated with water during the winter season and has distinct or prominent redox concentrations in the lower part of the epipedon.  These soils are dry for 60 to 70 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches within the 3-month period following the summer solstice.  The soil cracks from the surface to 20 inches or more.  Depth to intersecting slickensides is 25 to 35 inches.  Depth to carbonates and redox concentrations is 12 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.  Thin (1 to 5 millimeter thick) lenses of sand and fine gravel occur in the upper 40 inches in some pedons.  The soils are neutral to moderately alkaline.  Dry value of 5 or less, moist value of 2 or less and chroma of 1 or 2 extend down to 40 inches or more.  The soils are clay or silty clay to depths of 40 inches or more.  Lenses of sand, gravel or cobbles may occur below 40 inches.  Hue of the entire soil is 10YR or yellower.  Structure ranges from moderate to strong granular and very fine subangular blocky in the surface layer and weak to moderate and medium to coarse prismatic and moderate to strong angular and subangular blocky in all lower layers."

Summers are hot and dry with mean summer temperatures of 61 to 64 degrees F.  Winters are cool and moist with a mean winter temperature of 32 to 34 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 150 days.  The mean annual precipitation is from 9 to 14 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Curant soils occur on north-facing slopes in adjacent uplands and have sola with less than 35 percent clay.  McMeen soils have duripans and occur in adjacent uplands.  Tub and Simas soils occur in adjacent uplands and have clayey argillic horizons.  Willowdale soils are well-drained medium textured soils from recent alluvium."
