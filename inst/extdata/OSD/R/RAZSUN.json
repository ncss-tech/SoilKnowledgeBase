  "OVERVIEW": "The Razsun series consists of well drained, slowly permeable soils that are moderately deep to soft, gypsiferous shale on hillsides and footslopes.  They formed in slopewash alluvium and residuum. Slopes range from 5 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Depth to the base of the cambic horizon and depth to the gypsic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and 4 or 5 moist.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and 4 or 5 moist.  It is clay loam or clay.  EC is less than 4 mmhos.\nThe By horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and 4 or 5 moist.  It has 40 to 80 percent soft shale fragments which break down on pretreatment.  Gypsum ranges from 10 to 30 percent.  EC ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr is soft, platy, gypsiferous shale.  It commonly is more than 20 feet thick."
