Added a statement, that some pedons may have a BC Horizon.\nUpdated the competing series section\nRestated ranges for mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature.\nModified format by LRM in 3/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\n09/2008 GJJ removed English units and made some format changes.\n1/2015 DJK Updated climate data using 1981-2010 data. Updated RIC of mollic thickness, depth to redox, and PSCS clay content. Updated horizon ranges; split Bt into upper and lower, combined BC with C, changed to reaction classes rather than values. Updated competing series, distribution and extent, and additional data sections.\nADDITIONAL DATA:Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory data available for Pedon ID 71KS045002; Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory data available for Pedon ID numbers: 88KS061323, 89KS061545, 94KS087013, 95KS087010s, 95KS177022s, 96KS045101s, 97KS091001, 99KS197003, 04KS103019, and 05KS103045.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
