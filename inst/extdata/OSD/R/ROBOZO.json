  "REVDATE": "12/2007",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Robozo series consists of moderately deep, well drained moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived dominantly from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Robozo soils occur on gently sloping alluvial fans and lake terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 7 inches.",
