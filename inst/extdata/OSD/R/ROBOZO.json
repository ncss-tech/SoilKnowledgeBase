These soils in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived dominantly from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks. The average annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 50 degrees F. The freeze-free period is 110 to 130 days."

Bandag soils have a moisture regime that borders xeric. Saltair soils have a high water table and salic horizons. Uvada soils have a natric horizon."
