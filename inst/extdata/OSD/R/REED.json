  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  Reed soils are usually moist.  Soil reaction ranges from medium to very strongly acid.  The argillic horizon averages silty clay or clay and has 50 to 70 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 through 4 dry, and has prominent and distinct mottles.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to neutral, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 0 through 3 moist or dry.  It has moderate to strong subangular blocky to strong prismatic structure.  This horizon is silty clay or clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Reed soils occur in depressions on low terraces in narrow to wide river valleys adjacent to perennial streams at elevations ranging from 25 to 500 feet.  Reed soils formed in mixed alluvium eroded from shale, sandstone, basic igneous rocks, and glacial drift.  They are in a marine climate with an annual precipitation of 40 to 80 inches.  The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 65 degrees F.; and the  mean annual temperature of 52 degrees F.  The frost free season is 150 to 200 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very slow runoff; moderate permeability in the A horizons, moderately slow in the B21tg and B22tg horizons and slow below.  Reed soils are flooded for short periods when streams overflow and during the winter and early spring have a ground water table within 6 inches of the surface."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Where cleared and drained, Reed soils are used for grass hay and pasture, small grains, peas, and corn.  Native vegetation is alder, cottonwood, western hemlock, western red cedar, with an understory of marsh grasses, forbes, and shrubs."
