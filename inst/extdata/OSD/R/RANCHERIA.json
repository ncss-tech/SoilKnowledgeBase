  "OVERVIEW": "The Rancheria series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Rancheria soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rancheria soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder or backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,075 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 410 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
