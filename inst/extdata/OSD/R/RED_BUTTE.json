The soils formed in intermediate igneous and sedimentary parent rocks. The climate is dry subhumid. Mean annual air temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C., mean summer temperature is about 18 to 19 degrees C., and the average annual precipitation is about 300 to 400 mm. The frost free period is about 90 to 140 days."
