  "OVERVIEW": "The Red Butte series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks. Red Butte soils are on alluvial and colluvial slopes and rolling hills. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 325 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
