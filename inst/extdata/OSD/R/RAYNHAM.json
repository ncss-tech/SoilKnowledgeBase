  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 16 through 40 inches (40 to 102 centimeters). Rock fragments range from 0 through 2 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral in the solum and from moderately acid through slightly alkaline in the substratum. Below a depth of 40 inches (1 meter) from the surface, some pedons range through moderately alkaline and effervesce.\nSome pedons have O horizons\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YRYR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is silt loam, silt, very fine sandy loam or loam. Some pedons have a thin A horizon or AB horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It must have a matrix chroma 2 or less immediately below the A or Ap horizon or within 10 inches (25 centimeters) (inclusive) of the mineral surface. Texture is silt loam, silt, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. Thin layers, 1 to 3 inches (3 to 8 centimeters) thick, of sand or gravelly sand, and silty clay loam are in some pedons. Structure is weak or moderate, very fine through medium granular or subangular blocky. Some B horizons have prismatic structure. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6. Texture is silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam, and is commonly stratified (or varved). Thin layers of fine sand, sand, gravelly sand, or silty clay loam are in some pedons. Structure is massive or has plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable or firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series currently in the same family.\nConneaut, Munson, Raypol, Scantic, Scitico, Tonawanda, Wallington, and Walpole soils are similar soils in related families. Conneaut soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Munson, Scantic, and Scitico soils have more than 18 percent clay in the lower part of the control section. Raypol soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal and are more acid. Tonowanda soils are somewhat poorly drained and do not have a Bg horizon (chroma 2 or less) within 10 inches (25 centimeters) of the mineral soil surface, it has a Bw with chroma 3 directly under an A or Ap horizon. Wallington soils have a fragipan. Walpole soils have more than 70 percent fine sand or coarser in the substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Raynham soils are level through strongly sloping soils on lake plains and marine terraces. They are in depressions and drainageways and on side slopes of swells and knolls. Slope ranges from 0 through 12 percent. The soils formed in silty estuarine, marine or glaciolacustrine deposits. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 through 50 inches (762 through 1270 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 through 52 degrees F. (7 through 11 degrees C.) The frost-free season ranges from 105 through 240 days."

The well drained Hartland and Unadilla, moderately well drained Belgrade and Scio, poorly and very poorly drained Canandaigua, and very poorly drained Birdsall soils are in a drainage sequence with Raynham soils. The Eldridge, Enosburg, Munson, Raypol, and Walpole soils are on nearby terraces or lake plains. Eldridge and Enosburg soils have sandy solums. Raypol and Walpole soils have sandy substratums."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Raynham series has been defined more narrowly to assure it meets the concept of poorly drained. The Tonowanda series will take in pedons that were previously considered somewhat poorly.\n2. Episaturation was retained for this revision, although it is questionable whether the soil has a relatively impermeable layer.\n3. The use of the Raynham series in Maine, and in MLRA 143 and 144B, is relict to before temperature classes. These have been removed from the SC file.\n4. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 centimeters) (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 22 inches (15 to 56 centimeters) (Bw and Bg horizons).\nc. Aeric feature - in 50 percent or more of the matrix, a hue of 10YR or yellower and a value and chroma, moist, of 3 or more. (Bw and B'w horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
