  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 36 to 64 inches thick. Most pedons have essentially no gravel above the C horizon. The soils usually are moist in some or all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches from November or early December until May. They usually are continuously dry the rest of the time. The mean annual soil temperature is between 59 degrees and 64 degrees F., and the soil temperature is continuously above 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is very dark gray, dark gray, gray, very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, or grayish brown; hue is mostly 10YR, in some pedons, it is 2.5Y. This horizon is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, and is usually clay loam. Usually the surface or all the Al horizon is hard and massive. If not massive, structure is destroyed after several years of cultivation. This horizon is hard or very hard. It contains about 2 percent organic matter. The A horizon is usually slightly acid to neutral. Some pedons may be medium acid or moderately alkaline in part because of cultural measures.\nThe B2t horizon is dark gray, dark grayish brown, grayish brown, light brownish gray, brown, yellowish brown, pale brown, light yellowish brown or light olive brown with the higher values and brighter chromas in the lower part in the interior of the peds. It is heavy clay loam, sandy clay or clay and has about 35 to 45 percent clay. The B2t horizon has about 6 to 10 percent more clay than the A horizon. It has weak prismatic to strong angular blocky structure. This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline and alkalinity generally increases in the lower portion. Segregated lime is present in the lower part of the Bt horizon and upper C horizon. The boundary between the A horizon and B2t horizon is gradual or a transitional A3 or Bl horizon is present.\nThe C horizon is light gray, light brownish gray, pale brown, light yellowish brown or yellowish brown. It is usually clay loam, but stratification with other textures is present in some pedons. This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Azule series in this family and the Contra Costa, Danville, Milpitas Perkins, Pleasanton, Tierra, Trabuco and Zamora series in other families. Azule soils have clear A-B horizon boundaries with about 10 to 15 percent clay increase from A to B2 horizon. Contra Costa soils have a lithic contact at a depth of less than 40 inches. Danville soils have mollic epipedons. Milpitas and Tierra soils have abrupt A-B horizon boundaries with more than 15 percent clay increase. Perkins soils have reddish B2t horizons in hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR. Pleasanton soils have less than 35 percent clay in the B2t horizon. Trabuco soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the B2t horizon.  Zamora soils are silty and have less than 35 percent clay in the B2t horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rincon soils are on older alluvial fans and both stream and marine terraces at elevations of 20 to 2,000 feet. Gradient is 0 to 30 percent. The soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  The climate is subhumid, mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 20 inches.  Average January temperature is about 45 degrees to 52 degrees F., average July temperature is about 68 degrees to 75 degrees F., mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees  to 61 degrees F. The freeze-free season averages 200 to 300 days."

Antioch soils have natric horizons. Cropley soils are on fans and lack argillic horizons. Docas and Sorrento soils lack argillic horizons. Lockwood soils have mollic epipedons and have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon."
