  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "RBH-CJH-KMD",
  "REVDATE": "08/2015",
  "STATES": "MN,ND",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosewood series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous sandy lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains. These soils have moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the lower part. Slopes typically range from 0 to 2 percent, but range to 5 percent in areas with side hill seeps. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 53 centimeters.",
