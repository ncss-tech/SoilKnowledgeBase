  "OVERVIEW": "The Rocksalad series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitoid. The Rocksalad soils are on drainageways and fan aprons. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 195 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
