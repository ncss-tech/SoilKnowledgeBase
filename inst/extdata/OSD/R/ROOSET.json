  "OVERVIEW": "The Rooset series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from mixed sources. They are on alluvial fans, escarpments, hills, mountains and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
