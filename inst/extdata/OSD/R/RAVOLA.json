  "STATES": "CO,NM,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ravola series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from calcareous shale, siltstone, and sandstone.  Ravola soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, flood plain steps, and flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
