  "OVERVIEW": "The Rahal series is a member of the clayey, mixed, hyperthermic family of Arenic Albaqualfs.  These soils have light brownish gray and white neutral fine sand A horizons, light gray sandy clay mottled with yellowish brown, mildly alkaline upper Btg horizons, white sandy clay loam lower Btg horizons, and white fine sandy loam Cg horizons.",

The A horizon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The A1 horizon is light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/2), gray (10YR 5/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).  The+AA2g horizon is light gray (10YR 7/2) or white (10YR 8/2).\nThe B2tg horizons are light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2) or light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/1, 7/2; 2.5Y 7/2) and have mottles of yellows, reds, and browns.  They are clay, sandy clay, or clay loam.  Clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Btg horizon ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B3g horizon is white (10YR 8/1, 8/2; 2.5Y 8/2; 5Y 8/1, 8/2), light gray (2.5Y 7/2; 5Y 7/1, 7/2), or light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2; 10YR 6/2).  It has mottles of yellows, browns, and reds.  The B3g is sandy clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  The Cg horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.  It is gray to white.  In some pedons the Cg horizon has concretions or masses of calcium carbonate."
