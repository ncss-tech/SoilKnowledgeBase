The A horizon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The A1 horizon is light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/2), gray (10YR 5/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).  The+AA2g horizon is light gray (10YR 7/2) or white (10YR 8/2).\nThe B2tg horizons are light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2) or light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/1, 7/2; 2.5Y 7/2) and have mottles of yellows, reds, and browns.  They are clay, sandy clay, or clay loam.  Clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Btg horizon ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B3g horizon is white (10YR 8/1, 8/2; 2.5Y 8/2; 5Y 8/1, 8/2), light gray (2.5Y 7/2; 5Y 7/1, 7/2), or light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2; 10YR 6/2).

Fordtran soils have slightly acid to strongly acid B2tg horizons.  Galveston and Mustang soils lack an argillic horizon.  Panasoffkee soils lack an abrupt texture change between the A and Bt horizons.  Portalto soils lack an argillic horizon within 40 inches.  Roemer soils have less than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizons."
