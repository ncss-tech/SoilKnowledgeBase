  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series as defined includes the finer textured part of the soils originally placed in the Remsen series in the Mohawk Valley, the soils formerly classed in the Ohlton series in Ohio, and some soils that formerly were placed in the Darien and Mahoning series in western New York. It excludes silty clay loam soils that have been placed in the Darien series in western New York. Some areas mapped in the Remsen series include clay contents as high as 70 percent, these are treated as mapping inclusions. The original classification placed Remsen in the great group of Ochraqualfs. Because of changes established in the 8th edition of `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the new great group of Endoaqualfs. Competing series are expected to increase as similar soils are reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches (Ap and E horizons)\n2) Argillic horizon - from 9 to 30 inches (Bt and Btg horizons)\n3) Aeric subgroup - as evidenced by a subhorizon(s) between the base of the Ap horizon and a depth of 30 inches that is dominated (50 percent or more) by chroma and value of 3 or more (E and Bt1 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
