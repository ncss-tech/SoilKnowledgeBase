Rock fragments, dominantly soft fine shale, range from 5 to 20 percent by volume in the upper 10 inches of the Bt or to 40 inches and 0 to 30 percent in the substratum with up to 5 percent greater than 3 inches. Unless limed, soil reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid in the Ap horizon, moderately acid through slightly alkaline in the Bt horizons, and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of l or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe E horizon, were present, has hue of l0YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4 and has redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is moderate fine or medium subangular blocky or is weak or moderate platy. Consistence is friable or firm .\nThe Bt or Btg horizon has hue of l0YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6 and has redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay or clay, but may be silty clay loam in thin subhorizons with weighted clay content between 45 and 60 percent. Structure is moderate or strong, medium or coarse angular or subangular blocky, or it is prismatic that parts to blocky.\nThe BC horizon has texture and color ranges similar to the Bt horizon, but it contains free carbonates.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay or clay, but may be silty clay loam in thin subhorizons with weighted clay content between 45 and 60 percent. It has thin to thick plate-like divisions, or it is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Brockport, Caneadea, Churchville, Lockport, Odessa, and Rhinebeck series are in the same family. Brockport and Lockport soils have bedrock within depths of 40 inches. Churchville soils have a lithologic discontinuity and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section. Caneadea, Odessa and Rhinebeck soils formed in uniformly textured lacustrine deposits and have less than 5 percent rock fragment content in the particle size control section.\nThe Bennington, Blount, Del Rey, Fulton, Kimmel, Mahoning, and  Nappanee, series are in related famalies. Bennington and Mahoning soils have a weighted clay content of less than 45 percent in the argillic horizon. Blount soils have coarser textured A horizons and contain less than 45 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Del Rey, Fulton, and Kimmell, soils formed in uniformly textured lacustrine deposits and have less than 5 percent rock fragment content in the particle size control section. Nappanee soils have abrupt textural changes between the Ap and Bt and do not show evidence degradation in the upper part of the Bt."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. The clayey till regolith is predominantly from dark olive brown to olive, calcareous or neutral, finely bedded shale, but it contains a small amount of sandstone, limestone and granite. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 50 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F., and the frost-free period is from 135 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 250 to 1500 feet above sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Derb, Erie, Fonda, Fremont, Ravenna, Trumbull and Wadsworth soils on nearby landscapes. Derb and Fremont soils are more acid, contain less clay and lack argillic horizons. Erie, Ravenna, and Wadsworth soils are less clayey and contain a fragipan. Fonda soils are wetter soils in depressional landscapes. Trumbull soils have low chroma in more than 50 percent of the matrix in all subhorizons between the base of the Ap horizon and a depth of 30 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series as defined includes the finer textured part of the soils originally placed in the Remsen series in the Mohawk Valley, the soils formerly classed in the Ohlton series in Ohio, and some soils that formerly were placed in the Darien and Mahoning series in western New York. It excludes silty clay loam soils that have been placed in the Darien series in western New York. Some areas mapped in the Remsen series include clay contents as high as 70 percent, these are treated as mapping inclusions. The original classification placed Remsen in the great group of Ochraqualfs. Because of changes established in the 8th edition of `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the new great group of Endoaqualfs. Competing series are expected to increase as similar soils are reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches (Ap and E horizons)\n2) Argillic horizon - from 9 to 30 inches (Bt and Btg horizons)\n3) Aeric subgroup - as evidenced by a subhorizon(s) between the base of the Ap horizon and a depth of 30 inches that is dominated (50 percent or more) by chroma and value of 3 or more (E and Bt1 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
