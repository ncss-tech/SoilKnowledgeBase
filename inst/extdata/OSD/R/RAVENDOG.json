  "OVERVIEW": "The Ravendog series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Ravendog soils are on stream terraces and inset fans. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
