Kiote soils have mollic epipedons that are 16 to 24 inches thick and have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 20 to 40 inches.  Sawfork soils are deep to paralithic contacts and are calcareous within 25 inches of the soil surface.  Trespass soils have thicker mollic epipedons and have aquic conditions within 1 meter of the soil surface.  Tusel soils have mollic epipedons that are 16 to 22 inches thick, have mean summer soil temperature of 58 to 59 degrees F., and are deep to lithic contacts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rolldown soils are on moraines superimposed on mountains.  They typically occur on summit or shoulder positions.  They formed in volcanic ash and till derived from andesite, tuff, and metavolcanic rock.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 10,000 to 11,600 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches, the mean annual temperature is 33 to 38 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
