These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 51 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages from 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe A and AB horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  The AB horizon is clay loam or loam.  The A horizon is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 or 4 wet, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 wet, 2 to 4 dry.  It is clay, clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  It is very  strongly acid or moderately acid."

Bateman soils lack coarse fragments in the particle-size control section and have an average annual soil temperature of 52 to 57 degrees F.  Cornutt soils are slightly acid in the Bt horizon.  Freezener, Jumpoff and Melbourne soils lack an umbric epipedon.  Munset soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Oak Grove soils are moderately acid or slightly acid in all parts and are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days in the moisture control section.  Mildred and Oakland soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Veneta soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 53 to 55 degrees F; are dry for 60 to 80 days in the moisture control section following the summer solstice."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from breccia somewhat modified in places by glacial till.  Average annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 170 to 190 days."
