  "OVERVIEW": "The Rainier series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in materials weathered from breccia and glacial till.  Rainier soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 51 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages from 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe A and AB horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  The AB horizon is clay loam or loam.  The A horizon is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 or 4 wet, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 wet, 2 to 4 dry.  It is clay, clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  It is very  strongly acid or moderately acid."
