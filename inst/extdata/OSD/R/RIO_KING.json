  "OVERVIEW": "The Rio King series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess and volcanic ash.  The Rio King soils are on stream terraces and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
