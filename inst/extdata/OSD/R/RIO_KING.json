Burch, Calpine, Cashmere, Cashmont, Roloff, Roosevelt, and Surpass series are well drained.  In addition, Burch and Cashmere soils have Bw horizons.  Calpine soils have weakly expressed Bt horizons.  Cashmont and Surprise soils have gravelly control sections.  Roloff and Roosevelt soils are moderately deep over bedrock.  Snake Hollow soils have Bw horizons and more than half the sand fraction is very coarse sand."
