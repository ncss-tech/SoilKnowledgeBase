  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Russler series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in somewhat saline medium to moderately fine textured calcareous alluvial sediments over strongly gypsiferous interbedded clays, silts, sands, and gypsum bedrock. Russler soils are on nearly level or gently sloping, slightly concave uplands and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 F. degrees.",

Elevations range from 3,400 to 4,000 feet.  The parent material is somewhat saline medium to moderately fine textured calcareous alluvial sediments over strongly gypsiferous interbedded clays, silts, sands, and gypsum bedrock.  These sediments were derived from Permian and Triassic formations of the uplands.  The climate is warm, semiarid, continental.  The annual precipitation ranges from 10 to about 12 inches.  The annual temperature is about 62 degrees F."

Holloman soils lack a cambic horizon and have gypsum bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches.  Reeves soils have a gypsic family control section.  Upton soils have a petrocalcic horizon at depths of 7 to 20 inches."
