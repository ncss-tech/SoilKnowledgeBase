Mercey soils are in the Central California Coast Range (MLRA 15) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November. Mimbres and Prelo soils lack a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Russler soils are on nearly level or gently sloping, slightly concave landscapes with gradients generally less than 2 percent.  Elevations range from 3,400 to 4,000 feet.  The parent material is somewhat saline medium to moderately fine textured calcareous alluvial sediments over strongly gypsiferous interbedded clays, silts, sands, and gypsum bedrock.  These sediments were derived from Permian and Triassic formations of the uplands.  The climate is warm, semiarid, continental.  The annual precipitation ranges from 10 to about 12 inches.  The annual temperature is about 62 degrees F."

Ector, Karro, and Sotim soils have a calcic horizon.  Ector soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 inches.  Holloman soils lack a cambic horizon and have gypsum bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches.  Reeves soils have a gypsic family control section.  Upton soils have a petrocalcic horizon at depths of 7 to 20 inches."
