Easychair soils are moist for 10 to 20 days following convection storms from July through October and have mean annual temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C. Sagrlite soils have a temperature range from 11 to 13 degrees C. Sain soils contain 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Sondoa soils has soil temperature that range from 12 to 14 degrees C.  Swingler soils are dominantly loam and silt loam throughout the particle-size control section, do not have gypsum, and have less than 15 mmhos/cm electrical conductivity and less than 35 percent exchangeable sodium.  Timpie soils do not contain gypsum crystals at 40 to 100 cm, and contain 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rosney soils are on alluvial flat remnants and fan skirt foot slopes.  These soils formed in a thin loess mantle capping silty alluvium or lacustrine materials derived from mixed rock sources with some influence from volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are 1,370 to 2,130 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
