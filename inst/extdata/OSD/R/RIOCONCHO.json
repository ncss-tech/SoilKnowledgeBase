  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The soils were formerly included in the Frio series.\nThe taxonomy was changed from Vertic Haplustolls to Torrertic Haplustolls because these soils occur in an aridic-ustic soil moisture regime.(2013 THW, RFG)\nEdited 12/2013 (RFG-THW): Changed to fabular format and added metric values. Upedated the competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 91 cm (0 to 36 in) (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - 91 to 203 cm (36 to 80 in) (Bk horizon, does not have enough carbonates to be a calcic)\nTorrertic feature - Linear extensibility exceeds 6 cm within 100 cm (40 in) of the surface, and the soil has cracks greater than 5 mm that extend from the surface to greater than 50 cm (20 in) and the moisture control section in normal years is dry in some or all parts for six-tenths or more of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface is higher than 5 degrees C.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The Irion County Soil Survey has engineering index test data published from 1977.\nTaxanomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
