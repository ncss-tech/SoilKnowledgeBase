  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone bedrock is more than 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid in the A horizon, and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the other horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is mucky fine sand, mucky loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Btg horizon or Btkg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Masses of iron accumulation are in shades of red, yellow, or brown.  Texture of the Bt, Btkg, and Btg horizons is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Weighted clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of 5GY, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon of mixed sand and shell fragments.\nSome pedons have an R horizon below a depth of 40 inches.  It is hard limestone bedrock.  A Cr horizon consisting of soft, gravelly marl is above the R horizon in some pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rawhide soils are mostly in depressions and on flood plains within the Gulf Coast flatwoods on the coastal plain of northern Florida.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."
