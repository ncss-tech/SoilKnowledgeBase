They are distinguished by being somewhat poorly drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 8 inches (A horizon)\nAlbic horizon--the zone from 4 to 8 inches (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 60 inches below the surface (Bt, Btg, and BCg horizons)\nAquic conditions--the zone from 8 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation).\nSERIES INTERPRETATION RECORD(S): This series was developed after the termination of the NRCS-SOI-5 form.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
