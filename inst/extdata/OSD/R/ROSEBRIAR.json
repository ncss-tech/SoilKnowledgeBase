    "content": "TYPICAL PEDON:  Rosebriar gravelly sandy loam--on a 25 percent smooth, northeast aspect in rangeland at 5,700 feet elevation.  (Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.  When described on July 17, 1984, the soil was dry to 2 inches and moist below this depth.)\nE--0 to 2 inches; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak thin platy structure parting to weak fine granular; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 30 percent grave;; slightly alkaline (pH 7.4); clear smooth boundary. (1 to 4 inches thick)\nBt--2 to 7 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) very gravelly clay, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; moderate fine angular blocky structure; hard, firm, moderately sticky and moderately plastic; common very fine and few medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores, common distinct clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 40 percent gravel; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary. (4 to 7 inches thick)\nBtk--7 to 12 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) very gravelly clay, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; moderate medium and coarse angular blocky structure; hard, firm, very sticky and very plastic; few very fine roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores, many distinct clay films lining pores and on faces of peds; 45 percent gravel; few thin lime coats on undersides of coarse fragments; slightly alkaline (pH 7.6); gradual smooth boundary.

(4 to 8 inches thick)\nCr1--17 to 23 inches; fractured tuff; more than4 inches between fractures; root mats on rock fragments; and penetrating into fractures; very fine roots penetrate into tuff fragments; tuff is soft when moist and can be excavated easily with tiling spade; tuff is hard when dry and fractures when struck with tiling spade; some interstices are not filled with soil material; gradual wavy boundary.  (5 to 10 inches thick)\nCr2--23 inches; fractured tuff; more than 4 inches between fractures; many interstices are not filled with soil material; tuff is soft when moist and hard when dry."

Elevations are 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  Climate is cold and moist in winter and dry in summer.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches; average annual temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
