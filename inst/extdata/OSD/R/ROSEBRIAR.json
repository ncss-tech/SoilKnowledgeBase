  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosebriar series consists of shallow to soft bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium from tuff.  The Rosebriar soils are on ridges and foothills.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 20 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
