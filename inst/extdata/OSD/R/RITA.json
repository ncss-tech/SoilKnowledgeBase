  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

Depth to layers with n-value more than 0.7 ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  The reaction of the A or Oa horizon ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid, the B horizon ranges from extremely acid to neutral, and the C horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Oa or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is muck, mucky clay, or clay.\nThe Bg horizons have hue of 10YR, 5Y, 5BG, 5GY, or 5G, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1, or is neutral.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Some part of the Bg horizon has vertical cracks that do not close when the soil is wet.\nThe Cg horizon has the same color range as the Bg.  Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, 5BG, 5GY, or 5G, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Fausse and Harahan series.  Barbary, Gentilly, and Scatlake series are in similar families.  Harahan soils have fragments of wood in the lower layers and are not underlain with loamy layers.  Barbary, Gentilly, and Scatlake soils have higher n-values in the 8 to 20 inch part of the control section.  Fausse soils have n-values less than 0.7 below 36 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rita soils are on drained fresh water marshes at elevations below sea level.  These soils are protected from flooding by a system of levees and pumps, however during extreme tropical storms these soils flood.  Slope is less than 0.1 percent.  Near the type location the average annual rainfall is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
