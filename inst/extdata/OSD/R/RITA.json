  "OVERVIEW": "The Rita series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils in fresh water coastal marshes that have been protected from flooding by a system of levees and pumps.  These soils formed in a thin layer of herbaceous organic material overlying semi-fluid clayey sediments that dried and consolidated in the upper part as the result of artificial drainage.  Most of the organic material has oxidized since drainage.  Slopes range from 0 to 0.5 percent.",

Depth to layers with n-value more than 0.7 ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  The reaction of the A or Oa horizon ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid, the B horizon ranges from extremely acid to neutral, and the C horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Oa or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is muck, mucky clay, or clay.\nThe Bg horizons have hue of 10YR, 5Y, 5BG, 5GY, or 5G, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1, or is neutral.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Some part of the Bg horizon has vertical cracks that do not close when the soil is wet.\nThe Cg horizon has the same color range as the Bg.  Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, 5BG, 5GY, or 5G, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand."
