  "OVERVIEW": "The Redding series consists of moderately deep to duripan, well or moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  They are on nearly level or dissected fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches (630 mm) and the average annual temperature is about 63 degrees F (17 degrees C).",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redding soils are on nearly level or dissected fan remnants.  Microrelief may be hummocky.  Gravel and cobbles tend to concentrate in the swales in hummocky areas. Vernal pools  are common in areas with slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevations are 40 to 2,000 feet (12 to 610 m).  The soils formed in  alluvium of mixed rocks.  Climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 35 inches (254 to 889 mm).  Average January temperature is 45 degrees F (7 degrees C); average July temperature is 80 degrees F (27 degrees C); mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F (16 to 17 degrees C).  The frost-free season is 230 to 320 days."

San Joaquin soils are on lower, relatively younger terraces.  Auburn soils have bedrock at 10 to 20 inches (25 to 51 cm) and are usually on foothills above Redding soils.  Anderson soils lack a duripan and are on flood plains.  Corning soils lack a duripan and are in similar landscape positions, often in complex with Redding.  Kimball soils lack a duripan and are on lower, relatively younger terraces.  Newton, Newville, Perkins and Red Bluff soils lack a duripan."
