    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Eastbiggs (CA), San Joaquin (CA) and Yuvas (CA) series.  Eastbiggs soils have a perched water table (seasonal wetness) above the duripan.  San Joaquin soils have base saturation (sum) of 75 to 100 percent in some part of the soil above the argillic.  Yuvas soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches (51 to 102 cm)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Redding soils are on nearly level or dissected fan remnants.  Microrelief may be hummocky.  Gravel and cobbles tend to concentrate in the swales in hummocky areas. Vernal pools  are common in areas with slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Elevations are 40 to 2,000 feet (12 to 610 m).  The soils formed in  alluvium of mixed rocks.  Climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 35 inches (254 to 889 mm).  Average January temperature is 45 degrees F (7 degrees C); average July temperature is 80 degrees F (27 degrees C); mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F (16 to 17 degrees C).  The frost-free season is 230 to 320 days."

San Joaquin soils are on lower, relatively younger terraces.  Auburn soils have bedrock at 10 to 20 inches (25 to 51 cm) and are usually on foothills above Redding soils.  Anderson soils lack a duripan and are on flood plains.  Corning soils lack a duripan and are in similar landscape positions, often in complex with Redding.  Kimball soils lack a duripan and are on lower, relatively younger terraces.  Newton, Newville, Perkins and Red Bluff soils lack a duripan."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Redding soils were formerly classified as having kaolinitic mineralogy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 19 inches (0 to 48 cm) (A1, A2).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 19 to 22 inches (48 to 56 cm)(2Bt).\nDuripan - the zone from 22 to 35 inches (56 to 89 cm) (3Bqm).\nAbruptic subgroup - the argillic horizon has an abrupt upper boundary with an absolute clay increase of 15 to 40 percent.\nEdit log: 5/04/2003 edits for use in Butte County: change hardpan to duripan, expand thickness of the A horizon from 10 to 4 inches; Range in Characteristics-added some pedons have a BA horizon, to the A horizon added 7.5YR 4/6, 3/3, and 10YR 3/4 moist, added sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam; expanded reaction from slightly acid to neutral; in the Bt horizon added 7.5YR 5/4 dry, 5YR 4/6, 2.5YR 3/4 moist, added gravelly loam, cobbly loam, sandy clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam, cobbly sandy clay loam, gravelly clay loam, and cobbly clay loam, expanded reaction from slightly acid to neutral; in the 2 Bt horizon expanded reaction from slightly acid to neutral; in the 3 Bqm added 10YR 3/4 moist; Drainage and Permeability; expand range to include very slow to slow permeability.  In Butte County, Redding will be used only on mounds.\nEdits made after sdjr projects - AEC\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from the type location (sampled as reference project) established mineralogy as mixed.  Redding mapped in San Diego County is outside the range for the series.\nOther lab data to support this classification are samples S45CA-57-005 and S79CA-067-001.  This data is in the NSSL data base.  NSSL pedon S45CA-103-005 is the type location. Typical pedon for Northen Stanislaus Soil Survey area was NSSL pedon 05N0393.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
