Soil business systems are in the process of being updated to accommodate human-transported material classes. The artifactic family term will be added to the Taxonomic Class section once the system updates are complete.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 cm (^Au horizon).\nHuman transported material - the zone from 0 to 200 cm (^Au and ^Cu horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
