  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rollingstone series consists of deep well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess and in thick clayey pedisediments or residuum from dolomite.   Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to free carbonates ranges from 60 to 90 inches or more.  Depth to dolomite bedrock is typically 60 to 90 inches, but ranges to 120 inches or more.  The loess is 5 to 15 inches thick.  The content of chert gravel is less than 5 percent in the A and BA horizons and 10 to 35 percent in the 2B horizon. The Ap horizon or its equivalent has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizon, which ranges from 1 to 4 inches in thickness, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have an E horizon as much as 4 inches in thickness.  It has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are medium acid through neutral.\nThe BA horizon has chroma of 3 or 4.  It is slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe 2B horizon ranges from 2.5YR to 7.5YR hue.  It has value and chroma of 4 through 6, but chroma of more than 4 is dominant in at least the lower part of the argillic horizon.  It has 60 to 80 percent clay.  It has medium through very coarse angular blocky or prismatic primary structure.  It is firm or very firm and strongly or very strongly acid.\nA cobbly or gravelly clay loam or loam 3B or 3C horizon that is 1 to 2 feet thick is in many pedons where slope gradient is more than 12 percent.  Such horizons contain 40 to 80 percent coarse fragments. These fragments are mostly dolomite."

Gepp, Oaklet, and Swimley soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper part of the control section, and are more moist in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Dodgeville, Dubuque, Dunbarton, and NewGlarus soils have bedrock beginning within depths of 40 inches.  Lamoille soils contain less clay.  Southridge soils are fine-silty over clayey.  Valton soils are fine-silty."

These soils formed in 5 to 15 inches of loess and thick clayey pedisediments or residuum from dolomite.  Mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 28 to 34 inches."

Nodine and Southridge soils are on similar positions but Nodine soils have a loamy 2B horizon and Southridge soils have a thicker loess mantle.  Seaton soils are typically upslope where the loess mantle is thicker."
