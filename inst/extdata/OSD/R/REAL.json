  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used entirely as rangeland. The climax plant community is a tall grass and mid grass, oak savannah. The dominant grass is little bluestem. The other grasses are sideoats grama, tall grama, yellow Indiangrass, silver bluestem, slim tridens, pinhole bluestem, cane bluestem, tall dropseed, hairy grama, and perennial threeawns. The dominant forbs include Engelmann daisy, bushsunflower, and sensitive briar. The woody plants include live oak, Texas oak, flameleaf sumac, evergreen sumac, agarito, and greenbriar. With heavy stocking rates the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of sideoats grama, seep muhly and live oak. If continuous heavy grazing continues for many years, Ashe juniper will increase and form a dense stand with an understory of plants, such as Texas grama, red grama, puff sheath dropseed, Lindheimer muhly, and Texas persimmon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:The correct classification of this pedon as described is loamy rather than loamy-skeletal particle size class.  It was not changed from its original classification until a study is completed.  The pararock fragments function like rock fragments in the soil for most uses.\nThese soils were included with Tarrant soils which have a lithic contact of limestone bedrock. This series needs to be studied and redescribed where it is correlated to determine if the content of pararock fragments justifies the particle-size class of loamy, rather than loamy-skeletal, and if it has a petrocalcic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in) (A and Ak horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 15 to 33 cm (6 to 13 in) (Ak horizon)\nParalithic contact: 33 cm (13 in) (top of Cr layer)\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
