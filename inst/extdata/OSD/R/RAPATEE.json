  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Rapatee soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping ridgetops and sideslopes of reconstructed landscapes.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in materials that were excavated and reclaimed during surface mining operations.  The upper 122 cm (48 inches) of regolith is dominantly fine-earth material that has the darkened surface layers of pre-mined soils returned to the surface.  The underlying regolith below a depth of about 122 cm (48 inches) is a mixture of unconsolidated fine-earth material and fragments of bedrock.  Rock fragments are commonly soft shale and siltstone, with some sandstone and limestone included.  Mean annual temperature varies from 8.9 to 12.2 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation varies from 813 to 914 mm (32 to 36 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Lenzburg soils in areas that have been excavated during mining and the Ipava, Sable, and Tama soils on adjacent unmined landscapes.  Lenzburg soils are nearby; graded areas are on similar parts of the landscape, and ungraded areas are steeper or on narrow parallel ridges.  Lenzburg soils have not had the darkened surface layers returned to the surface after mining.  Ipava, Sable, and Tama soils formed in loess and contain B horizons."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained.  The potential for surface runoff is low to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometer per second) in the surface layer, is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) and low to moderately low (0.01 to 0.42 micrometers per second) in the substratum to a depth of about 122 cm (48 inches), and is low to moderately low (0.01 to 0.42 micrometer per second) in the lower part of the substratum. Permeability is moderately slow in the surface layer, is moderately slow and very slow in the substratum to a depth of about 48 inches, and is very slow in the lower part of the substratum.  Water perches at various levels within the soil on the compressed layers, but primarily on the discontinuity at a depth of about 122 cm (48 inches)."
