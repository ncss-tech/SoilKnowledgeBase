The Rolie soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F. More than 50 percent of the precipitation falls as gentle rain or snow in winter and the remainder as intense summer thunderstorms. The frost-free period is 135 to 175 days."
