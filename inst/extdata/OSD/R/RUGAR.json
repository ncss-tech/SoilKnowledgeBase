  "OVERVIEW": "The Rugar series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuff siltstone, claystone and sandstone.  These soils are on fan piedmont remnants with rock core, concave side slopes and foot slopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
