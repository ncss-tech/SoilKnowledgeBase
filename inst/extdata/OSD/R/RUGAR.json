  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum derived from siltstone, tuff claystone and sandstone.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,680 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is cool semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
