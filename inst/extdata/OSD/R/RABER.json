  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonate ranges from about 12 to 20 inches.  Up to 15 percent by volume pebbles and cobbles up to 6 inches in diameter are in most pedons.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam or clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or clay with an estimated 35 to 45 percent clay and with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk and Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They have few to many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or clay.  Mottling inherent to the parent material is common in the C horizon below depths of about 30 inches.  Bedded shale is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Beadle, Carlson, Harney, Kirley, McClure, Mento, Peno, Reliance, and Spearville soils in the same family.   Beadle soils have thicker A horizons and are more moist in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice.  Carlson soils contain more carbonate in the C horizon.  Harney, McClure, Mento, Reliance, and Spearville contain less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand in the series control section and formed in silty materials.  In addition, Mento soils have 5 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the B and C horizons.  Kirley soils formed in alluvium.  Peno soils have carbonate at depths of 6 to 11 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Raber soils are nearly level to strongly sloping on uplands.  Slopes are plane or convex.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  Raber soils formed in firm clay loam glacial till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 19 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Cavo, Demky, Eakin, Gettys, Glenham, Highmore, Jerauld, Oko, and Peno soils.  The Cavo, Demky, and Jerauld soils have a natric horizon and are on nearly level to gently sloping areas.  The Eakin and Highmore soils are on nearby level or gentle slopes and are fine silty. The Gettys and Peno soils typically are on adjacent steeper slopes.  The Gettys soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Glenham soils are fine-loamy.  Oko soils contain more clay in the series control section.  Glenham and Oko soils are on similar landscapes to the Raber series."
