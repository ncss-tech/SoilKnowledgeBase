  "OVERVIEW": "The Roselle series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from coarse grained, acid igneous rocks, primarily granite. These soils are on terraces and footslopes in mountain basins. Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.",

Irondale, and Taumsauk soils are loamy-skeletal and are higher in the landscape. Knobtop soils are moderately deep, fine-silty and are on ridgetops of mountainous areas. Relfe and Secesh soils are better drained and are on floodplains and lower terraces. Skranka soils are fine textured and have a higher base saturation and are on similar positions. Syenite soils are well drained, moderately deep to bedrock, and are at higher elevations. Trackler soils are deep to hard igneous rocks and are at higher elevations."
