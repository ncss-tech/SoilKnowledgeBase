Hassler soils have a lithic contact from 40 to 60 inches. Thurmont soils formed in material weathered from metamorphic rocks. Tulip soils average 15 to 34 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Roselle soils are on terraces and footslopes on basin-floor remnants in mountain basins. The soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from coarse grained, acid igneous rocks, predominantly granite. Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 38 to 45 inches."

Courtois soils are fine textured, have a stone line, and are on similar landscape postions. Delassus and the loamy-skeletal Killarney soils have a fragipan and are at higher elevations. Irondale, and Taumsauk soils are loamy-skeletal and are higher in the landscape. Knobtop soils are moderately deep, fine-silty and are on ridgetops of mountainous areas. Relfe and Secesh soils are better drained and are on floodplains and lower terraces. Skranka soils are fine textured and have a higher base saturation and are on similar positions. Syenite soils are well drained, moderately deep to bedrock, and are at higher elevations. Trackler soils are deep to hard igneous rocks and are at higher elevations."

However, the majority of the profiles sampled are in the active family, so active was used for the classification.Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (Ap and E horizons)2) argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 57 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, 2Bt6 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of Missouri soil characterization lab number M9312331.These soils were previously mapped with Courtois, Delassus, and Syenite soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
