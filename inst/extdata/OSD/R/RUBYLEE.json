  "OVERVIEW": "The Rubylee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Rubylee soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
