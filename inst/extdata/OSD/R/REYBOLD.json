Base saturation at the critical depth for taxonomic placement exceeds 35 percent (sum of cations). The high base status is thought to be due to extensive liming practices and not inherent of parent material weathering.\nDiagnostic horizons and characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 25 cm (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 76 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity--Abrupt textural contact at 76 cm (2BC horizon)"
