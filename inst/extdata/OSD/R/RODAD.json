  "OVERVIEW": "The Rodad series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Rodad soils are on hills, mountain slopes and pediments.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
