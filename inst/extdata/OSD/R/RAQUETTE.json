  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The depth to free carbonates ranges from 15 to 36 inches. Rock fragments, dominantly limestone gravel, range from 3 to 35 percent by volume in the solum and from 20 to 60 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or very weak, granular or subangular blocky structure. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 2 through 8. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from neutral through mildly alkaline.\nThe 2BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 2 through 8. It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from neutral through mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4. It commonly is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction. Thin strata of sandy loam and fine sandy loam are in some pedons. It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

The soils formed in glacio-fluvial or deltaic material overlying sand and gravel. The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches. The growing season ranges from 120 to 150 days."

The well drained Pyrities and Grenville soils, the moderately well drained Kalurah and Hogansburg soils and the somewhat poorly drained Malone soils are on nearby landscapes but formed in glacial till and are in coarse-loamy families. Nehasne soils formed in glacial till and are moderately deep to bedrock. Waddington soils are in similar topographic settings but have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section."
