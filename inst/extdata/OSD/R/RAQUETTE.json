(Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)\nAp -- 0 to 9 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; weak very fine, fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine and few medium and coarse roots; 3 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt smooth boundary.  (8 to 10 inches thick.)\nBw -- 9 to 19 inches; brown (7.5YR 4/4) sandy loam; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; very friable; many fine and few medium roots; many fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; neutral; abrupt wavy boundary.  (8 to 31 inches thick.)\n2BC -- 19 to 25 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and dark brown (10YR 3/3) gravelly loamy sand; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; common fine vesicular pores and few fine medium and coarse tubular pores; 30 percent gravel; slightly alkaline; clear irregular boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The depth to free carbonates ranges from 15 to 36 inches. Rock fragments, dominantly limestone gravel, range from 3 to 35 percent by volume in the solum and from 20 to 60 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or very weak, granular or subangular blocky structure. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 2 through 8. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from neutral through mildly alkaline.\nThe 2BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 2 through 8. It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction ranges from neutral through mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4. It commonly is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction. Thin strata of sandy loam and fine sandy loam are in some pedons. It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Raquette soils are on terraces, kames, or moraines in the uplands. Slopes commonly are 2 to 15 percent, but range from 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in glacio-fluvial or deltaic material overlying sand and gravel. The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches. The growing season ranges from 120 to 150 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Grenville, Hogansburg, Kalurah, Nehasne, Pyrites, Malone, and Waddington soils. The well drained Pyrities and Grenville soils, the moderately well drained Kalurah and Hogansburg soils and the somewhat poorly drained Malone soils are on nearby landscapes but formed in glacial till and are in coarse-loamy families. Nehasne soils formed in glacial till and are moderately deep to bedrock. Waddington soils are in similar topographic settings but have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: It is questionable whether the 2 prefix on horizons for the 2BC and 2C in the Typical Profile are necessary. This item needs further review in the MLRA update process.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizons - the zone from 9 to 19 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Typic Eutrudepts feature - have free carbonates within a depth of one meter from the surface (2C horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available for the typical pedon (S81NY8909-(1-4).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
