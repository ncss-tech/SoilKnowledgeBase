    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Redapple soils are on mountainflanks and mountaintops of lahars. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in ashy colluvium over weathered colluvium and residuum derived from andesitic tuff breccia. Elevation is 950 to 1500 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 1325 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C. The frost free season is 175 to 215 days."
