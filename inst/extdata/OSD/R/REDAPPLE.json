  "OVERVIEW": "The Redapple series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in ashy colluvium over weathered colluvium and residuum from andesitic tuff breccia. The Redapple soils are on mountainflanks and mountaintops of lahars. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
