  "OVERVIEW": "The Ralock series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess influenced by volcanic ash and colluvium from basalt on north-facing hillslopes and alluvium on alluvial fans.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
