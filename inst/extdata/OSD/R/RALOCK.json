These soils formed in loess influenced by volcanic ash and colluvium from basalt and alluvium.   Elevations are 1,800 to 2,500 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 69 degrees F; and average annual temperature is 49 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 120 to 170 days."
