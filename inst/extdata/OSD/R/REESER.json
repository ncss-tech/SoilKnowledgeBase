These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 15 to 20 inches and includes part of argillic horizon.  The upper 10 to 20 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.45 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of acid oxalate iron of 0.25 to 0.6 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments by volume.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent in the Ap or A horizons.  The depth to an extremely or very gravelly moderately cemented iron- silica duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizons  have value of 3 through 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and 1 or 2 moist.\nThe BA horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 through 3 moist.  It is a ashy loam or ashy clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is clay or gravelly clay.\nThe 3Bstqm horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravely sandy clay loam.\nThe 3Bsqm horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist.

These soils formed in alluvium and glacial draft over a duripan with an influence of loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface.  Elevation is 1,700 to 3,100 feet.  These soils are in semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 69 degrees F.; and average annual temperature is about 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."
