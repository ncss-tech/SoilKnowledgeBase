  "REVDATE": "11/1999",
  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Reeser series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and glacial drift over a duripan with an influence of loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface.  They are on old uplifted fan remnants, old terraces and old till plains.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments by volume.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent in the Ap or A horizons.  The depth to an extremely or very gravelly moderately cemented iron- silica duripan is 20 to 40 inches.
