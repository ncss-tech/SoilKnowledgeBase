    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Reggear soils are on mountain slopes or hills on basalt plateaus. They have elevations of 1,600 to 3,800 feet (488 to 1158 meters) and slopes of 2 to 40 percent. These soils formed in loess and reworked loess with a mixed volcanic ash mantle. The average annual air temperature varies from about 38 degrees to about 45 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 26 to 45 inches (660 to 1143 mm), and the frost free period is 80 to 120 days."

Carlinton and Cavendish soils are on south and west facing hills and have xeric moisture regimes. Kauder and Grangemont soils are on similar landscapes and have ash mantles 7 to 13 inches thick. Grangemont soils do not have a fragipan. Wilkins soils are in drainageways and are somewhat poorly drained."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Type location moved to present location in 1983.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Oi and A horizons)\nVitrandic feature - the zone from 2 to 13 inches (A and Bw horizons)\nOxyaquic feature - the zone from 22 to 31 inches (2Bt/E horizon) having saturation with water for 30 or more cumulative days.\nCambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 13 inches (Bw horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 22 to 86 inches (2Bt/E, 2Btx1, 2Btx2, and 2Btx3 horizons)\nFragipan - the zone from 31 to 86 inches (2Btx1, 2Btx2, and 2Btx3 horizons)\nParticle size control section - the zone from 22 to 31 inches (2Bt/E horizon)\nReggear meets the criteria for the Oxyaquic subgroup - having saturation with water in one or more layers above the fragipan for 30 or more cumulative days.\nThe 2/2009 revision reflects a change in great group from Fragiudalfs to Fraglossudalfs.  The colors in the 2Bt/E horizon in the typical pedon meet the criteria for a glossic horizon.\nThis series needs further MLRA investigation because the colors listed in the range in characteristics cross taxonomic requirements for both Fraglossudalfs and Fragiudalfs.  The drainage class of Reggear should also be investigated because as described this series appears to meet the MO-1 guide for somewhat poorly drained.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data are available for this series: Reference sample - S83ID-035-002 (84P107) (this pedon) and S83ID-035-005 (84P112) from Clearwater County, Idaho; 9/83 by NSSL, Lincoln, NE. Partial laboratory data available S91ID- 009-004 (92P0277) from east Benewah County, Idaho; by NSSL, Lincoln, NE. Laboratory data available for a pedon sampled as Reggear but in a coarse-silty family S04ID-057-016 (04N1099) from Latah County, Idaho; by NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
