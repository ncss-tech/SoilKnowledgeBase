  "REVDATE": "07/2013",
  "STATES": "ID,WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Reggear series consists of moderately deep to a fragipan, moderately well-drained soils on mountain slopes or hills on basalt plateaus. They formed in a thin mantle of mixed volcanic ash over loess and reworked loess. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or low in the fragipan. Slopes are 2 to 40 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 35 inches.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Type location moved to present location in 1983.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Oi and A horizons)\nVitrandic feature - the zone from 2 to 13 inches (A and Bw horizons)\nOxyaquic feature - the zone from 22 to 31 inches (2Bt/E horizon) having saturation with water for 30 or more cumulative days.\nCambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 13 inches (Bw horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 22 to 86 inches (2Bt/E, 2Btx1, 2Btx2, and 2Btx3 horizons)\nFragipan - the zone from 31 to 86 inches (2Btx1, 2Btx2, and 2Btx3 horizons)\nParticle size control section - the zone from 22 to 31 inches (2Bt/E horizon)\nReggear meets the criteria for the Oxyaquic subgroup - having saturation with water in one or more layers above the fragipan for 30 or more cumulative days.\nThe 2/2009 revision reflects a change in great group from Fragiudalfs to Fraglossudalfs.  The colors in the 2Bt/E horizon in the typical pedon meet the criteria for a glossic horizon.\nThis series needs further MLRA investigation because the colors listed in the range in characteristics cross taxonomic requirements for both Fraglossudalfs and Fragiudalfs.  The drainage class of Reggear should also be investigated because as described this series appears to meet the MO-1 guide for somewhat poorly drained."
