  "REVDATE": "12/2010",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rapho series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that were formed in mixed alluvium from limestone, sandstone and shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats and fan skirts. Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
