  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches.  Free calcium carbonate typically is at the surface, but some pedons are leached to 5 inches.  The calcic horizon is at depths of 16 inches or less.  The calcium carbonate equivalent of the calcic horizon ranges from 15 to 45 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt loam, but is silty clay loam in some pedons. It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 45 percent.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has common to many redoximorphic features of chroma of 2 or less.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and typically is varved with very thin strata of very fine sand to clay. Varves range from 1 mm to 5 mm in thickness.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rondell soils are level and nearly level on plane and convex surfaces in glacial lake plains.  Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in silty, calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches.  Growing season is about 125 to 135 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 14 to 17 inches; and growing degree days are about 2600 to 3200."

Bearden soils are in slightly lower positions on the landscape.  Putney soils are on higher convex parts of the landscape. Beotia and Gardena soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Beotia and Gardena soils are in swales.  Harmony and Winship soils have an argillic horizon.  Harmony soils are on broad smooth flats.  Winship soils are in shallow depressions and flat drainageways. The Great Bend soils are well drained and contain less carbonates. Great Bend soils are on higher convex parts of the landscape.  The poorly drained Tonka soils have a fine textured control section and are in depressions."
