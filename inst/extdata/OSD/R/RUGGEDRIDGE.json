These soils are usually moist, and are 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to bedrock contact had andic soil properties with 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 5 to 20 percent field estimated clay and 40 to 60 percent sand.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 2, 4, or 6 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 2 to 3 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y moist and dry, value of 3 through 5 moist and 4, 6, or 7 dry, chroma of 4 through 6 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial fine sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial fine sandy loam, or extremely gravelly medial loam.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter."
