  "OVERVIEW": "The Roloc series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from granitic rock. Roloc soils are on mountain back slopes and ridges. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
