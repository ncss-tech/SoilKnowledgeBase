  "OVERVIEW": "The Ratscat series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on relict lakebeds and playas. Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
