It is loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam, and ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Average sand content coarser than very fine sand ranges from 10 to 15 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section and clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent. The C horizon is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  Some pedons have thin strata of coarser or finer textured material in the C horizon.  The C horizon ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.  Spots and thin lenses of calcareous materials are in the C horizon of some pedons.\nThe buried A horizon, where present, is at a depth of 40 inches or more below the soil surface.  The Ab horizon, where present, is loam, very fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe C' horizon has the same range in color and texture as the C horizon except texture ranges to fine sandy loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Morganfield series in the same family and the Bruin, Coushatta, Gracemont, Idabel, Keo, Natchez, Norwood, Pulaski, Severn, Sterlington, Vicksburg, and Yahola series.  Bruin, Coushatta, Keo, and Natchez soils have cambic horizons.  Coushatta and Norwood soils have fine-silty control sections.  Gracemont, Idabel, Pulaski, and Yahola soils have more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Morganfield soils have hues of 10YR or yellower.  Vicksburg soils are strongly or very strongly acid throughout the control section.  Norwood, Severn, and Yahola soils are calcareous in all horizons below 10 inches.  Sterlington soils have strongly acid to neutral argillic horizons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in stratified, loamy alluvium of Permian Red Bed origin.  Some areas are subject to rare to frequent flooding.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 42 to 60 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 70 degrees F."
