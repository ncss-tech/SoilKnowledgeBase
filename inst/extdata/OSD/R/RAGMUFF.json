  "OVERVIEW": "The Ragmuff series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, moderately deep to densic contact, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till on till plains, hills, ridges, and mountains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the mineral solum, and moderately high to moderately low in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 3.8 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm at the type location.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 115 cm. Depth to bedrock ranges from 50 to 100 cm from the mineral soil surface. Depth to densic contact is greater than 50 cm from the mineral soil surface. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. The weighted average of clay in the particle-size control section is 3 to 18 percent. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the particle size control section, and may range to 50 percent in some Cd horizons. Stones and boulders cover from 0 to 15 percent of the surface. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.\nThe Oi, Oa, and Oe horizons, where present, have hues of 5YR to 10YR, values of 2.5 to 4, and chromas of 1 to 4.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bh horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nSome pedons have a friable C layer with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Cd layer has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It has weak or moderate, thin to thick plates considered to be inherited from the parent material, or the horizon is massive.\nThe bedrock is generally slate, or strongly to weakly metamorphosed shale or sandstone, or less commonly granite or diorite."

The soils formed in a moderately deep mantle of till derived primarily from slate and other metasediments, phyllite, or schist, and less commonly from granite and diorite. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 6 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 860 to 1170 mm. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from 91 to 762 meters above mean sea level."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 5 to 10 cm (E horizon).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 28 cm (Bs1 and Bs2 horizons).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 28 to 68 cm (Bs3 and BC horizons).\nAquic conditions - redoximorphic features at 48 centimeters.\nDensic contact - firm lodgment till at 68 centimeters (Cd layer).\nLithic contact - metasedimentary rock at 85 centimeters (R layer).\nOther features - frigid temperature regime and udic moisture regime.\n2. This series was proposed for use primarily in areas previously mapped as Elliottsville in the north woods of Maine that have seasonally perched water tables over thin layers of densic material.\n3. The series name is taken from Ragmuff Stream, which flows into the West Branch of the Penobscot River in the north woods of Maine.\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon is characterized by the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln Nebraska, reference pedon 08NO120. Climate data from Telos dam TAPS station.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
