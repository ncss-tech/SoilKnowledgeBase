    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The profiles are usually moist but are dry in all parts for 45 consecutive days or more within the 3-month period following the summer solstice in more than 6 years out of 10.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 to 55 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact range from 12 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments of weathered sedimentary rock range from few to 35 percent in the control section, the amount increasing with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist, 3 or 4 dry.  It has strong or moderate granular or moderate or weak subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It ranges from silty clay to clay and has 40 to 50 percent clay.  This horizon has strong or moderate fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  The clay films range from few thin to common or many moderately thick."

Chehulpum soils have 18 to 35 percent clay.  Nekia soils have a hue of 10YR and lack a Bt horizon.  Witzel soils have a lithic contact and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Rickreall soils are on gentle smooth ridges to steep foothills and uplands of the Coast Range at elevations of 300 to 800 feet.  The soils formed in fine textured colluvium and residuum weathered from sedimentary bedrock.  The winters are cool and moist and the summers are warm and dry.  The average January temperature is 39 degrees F.  The average July temperature is 67 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  The frost-free season is 165 to 210 days."

Willakenzie soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and have 27 to 35 percent clay."
