  "OVERVIEW": "The Rubylake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loess and alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Rubylake soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
