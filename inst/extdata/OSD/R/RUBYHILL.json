  "OVERVIEW": "The Rubyhill series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a strongly cemented duripan.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Rubyhill soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
