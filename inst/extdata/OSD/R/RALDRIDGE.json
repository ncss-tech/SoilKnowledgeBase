Ralock soils have since been reclassified into a vitrandic subgroup.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 22 inches (the A, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 3 to 22 inches (the Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 22 to 60 inches (the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 3 to 22 inches (the Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998\".\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
