  "OVERVIEW": "The Raldridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and alluvium from lacustrine sediments and basalt on hill sides.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Raldridge soils have slopes of 4 to 12 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
