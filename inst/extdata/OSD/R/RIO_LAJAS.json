  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. BCD",
  "REVDATE": "06/2002",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rio Lajas series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy coastal plains sediments.  This nearly level to sloping soils is in the coastal plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 67 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is over 60 inches.  Thickness of the argillic is more than 50 inches.  These soils are loose, nonsticky and nonplastic throughout.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral throughout the profile.  The mean annual soil temperature is 75 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hues of 5YR, values of 3, and chroma of 3 and 4.  Texture is dominantly sand.  The A2 and A3 is sand or loamy sand.  Thickness of the A horizons is 26 to 40 inches.\nThe Bt horizon has hues of 5YR or 2.5YR, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other know series in the same family.  The Candelero, Cayagua, Fajardo, Islote, Juncal, Rio Arriba, San Sebastian, Tanama, Vega Baja and Via series are similar soils in related families.  The Candelero, Cayagua and Vega Baja soils are finer textured and all have low chroma mottles in their profiles.  The Fajardo and Rio Arriba soils have COLE value higher than 0.09 in their horizons.  The Islote, Juncal, San Sebastian and Via soils all are finer textured.  The Tanama soils are finer textured and shallower to the hard limestone."
