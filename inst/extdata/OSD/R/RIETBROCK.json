  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 36 to 60 inches.  Thickness of the loess or other silty mantle and depth to the underlying till and residuum ranges from 7 to 15 inches.  Depth to lithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Volume of angular gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, from 3 to 35 percent in the upper part of the till, and from 15 to 60 percent in the lower part of the till.  Volume of angular cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle, from 5 to 15 percent in the upper part of the till, and from 5 to 40 percent in the lower part of the till. A stony phase is recognized in some places. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part. Redox accumulatins are commonly throughout the soil below the A horizon. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and saturation occurs there for some time in most years.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the Ap or A horizon is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is typically silt loam but where the silty mantle is thin, texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nIn a few pedons, immediately below the Ap or A horizons, there are colors similar to those of a spodic horizon, but such layers are too thin or do not meet the chemical requirements for spodic.\nRietbrock soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the degree of eluviation.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons, singly or in combination.\nTypically the E part of the glossic horizon has color like the E horizon described above. Texture is typically silt loam but in pedons where the silty mantle is thin, texture of the 2E part is loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe Bt part of the glossic horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 3 to 5.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  Typically, texture is silt loam but where the silty mantle is thin, texture of the 2B part is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5; and chroma is 4 to 6.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with color like the 2Bt horizon. Texture is the gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly analogs of sandy loam or loam.\nThe 2R horizon is igneous or metamorphic bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on glaciated uplands underlain by bedrock.  Slopes are plane and concave and range from 1 to 12 percent.  Rietbrock soils formed in thin loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying loamy till and residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic bedrock. The till is derived mainly from the local residuum. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F."

The well drained Rozellville soils are on higher lying positions on nearby areas, but are underlain by loamy glacial till and residuum.  The well drained Fenwood soils are on higher lying positions and are in a drainage sequence with the Rietbrock soils.  The Meadland and Milladore soils are on similar slope positions as the Rietbrock soils, but are underlain by loamy glacial till and residuum and have bedrock at a depth greater than 60 inches.  The poorly drained and very poorly drained Sherry soils occupy drainageways adjacent to the Rietbrock soils."
