  "OVERVIEW": "The Ravensroost series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium from basalt, andesite or saprolitic tuffs. These soils are on summits and mountain side slopes. Slopes are 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. These soils have a volcanic ash mantle 14 to 25 inches thick. The upper 14 to 25 inches of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cc, glass content of 5 to 30 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2 percent and 15-bar water retention of less than 12 percent for air dried samples. The lower part of the particle-size control section averages 10 to 20 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist or dry. Texture is gravelly loam, loam, or cobbly fine sandy loam."
