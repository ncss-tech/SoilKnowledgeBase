These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. These soils have a volcanic ash mantle 14 to 25 inches thick. The upper 14 to 25 inches of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cc, glass content of 5 to 30 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2 percent and 15-bar water retention of less than 12 percent for air dried samples. The lower part of the particle-size control section averages 10 to 20 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist or dry. Texture is gravelly loam, loam, or cobbly fine sandy loam."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ravensroost soils are on mountain summits and side slopes. Slopes are 5 to 30 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium from andesite, basalt, or saprolitic tuffs. Elevations range from 3,500 to 6,000 feet. These soils are in a climate with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 90 inches. The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F., and the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F., The mean annual temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 35 to 75 days."
