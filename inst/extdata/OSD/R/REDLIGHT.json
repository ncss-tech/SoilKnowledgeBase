    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Redlight soils are on limestone hills and mountains at elevations of 3,000 to 4,000 feet (914 to 1,219 m). Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone bedrock. The regolith consists of a thin mantle of loamy earth, containing many coarse fragments. The underlying rocks are thick bedded limestone. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches (254 to 330 mm).  The mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F. (20 to 22 degrees C).  The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days."

Corazones soils are very deep and occur on alluvial fans, terraces, and piedmont slopes. Ojinaga soils have petrocalcic horizons and occur on alluvial fans, terraces, and piedmont slopes. Terlingua soils do not have a calcic horizon and occur on similar positions over igneous bedrock."
