  "OVERVIEW": "The Redlight series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from thick bedded limestone bedrock. Redlight soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 70 degrees F. (21 degrees C) and the mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches (279 mm).",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone bedrock. The regolith consists of a thin mantle of loamy earth, containing many coarse fragments. The underlying rocks are thick bedded limestone. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches (254 to 330 mm).  The mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F. (20 to 22 degrees C).  The frost-free period is 240 to 280 days."

Corazones soils are very deep and occur on alluvial fans, terraces, and piedmont slopes. Ojinaga soils have petrocalcic horizons and occur on alluvial fans, terraces, and piedmont slopes. Terlingua soils do not have a calcic horizon and occur on similar positions over igneous bedrock."
