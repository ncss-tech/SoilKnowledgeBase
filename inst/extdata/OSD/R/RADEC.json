Flatron, Ruckles and Waterbury soils have 50 to 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Gwinly and Laufer soils have a mollic epipedons that are thicker than 10 inches.  Longcreek and Pioche soils have an aridic soil moisture regimes.  Loomer soils have an aridic soil moisture regimes and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the paticle size control section.  Vantage soils have an aridic soil moisture regimes and have silica accumulations in the argillic horizons.  Camaspatch  and Lorella soils do not allow 5YR colors in the Bt horizon and have slightly acid reactions and are dry for 90 or more consectutive days when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F."
