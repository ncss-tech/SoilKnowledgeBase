  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Roswell series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy material that has been reworked by wind.  These soils are on upland plains, alluvial fans and valley sideslopes.  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).",

Similar soils are the Nutivoli and Milsand series.\nAguena series: are in a drier climate that receives 229 to 305 mm (9 to 12 in) of precipitation and support a slightly different plant community.\nDurazo series: receive significant amounts of moisture in the soil moisture control section during the months of December to March.  In addition, these soils support a distinctively different vegetative community typical of the Sonoran Desert.\nNutivoli and Milsand series: are moist in the soil moisture control section for slightly longer periods (aridic-ustic)."
