  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Routt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess, colluvium, alluvium, and residuum derived from sedimentary rock.  Routt soils are on plateaus, hills, benches, and sloping mountainsides.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",
