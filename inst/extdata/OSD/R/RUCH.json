  "OVERVIEW": "The Ruch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Ruch soils are on high stream terraces, alluvial fans and footslopes and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Solum thickness is over 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam, or gravelly silt loam with 12 to 20 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent gravel.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam and averages 25 to 35 percent clay with 18 to 25 percent sand coarser than very fine sand but finer than coarse sand.  It has 5 to 15 percent partially weathered gravel and 0 to 5 percent partially weathered cobbles.  Uncoated sand and silt layers are common in the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons. It is moderately or slightly acid."
