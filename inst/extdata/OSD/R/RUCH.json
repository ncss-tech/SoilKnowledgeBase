    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 80 to 110 consecutive days throughout the moisture control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Solum thickness is over 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam, or gravelly silt loam with 12 to 20 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent gravel.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam and averages 25 to 35 percent clay with 18 to 25 percent sand coarser than very fine sand but finer than coarse sand.  It has 5 to 15 percent partially weathered gravel and 0 to 5 percent partially weathered cobbles.  Uncoated sand and silt layers are common in the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons. It is moderately or slightly acid."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from altered sedimentary and extrusive igneous rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is typicaly 20 to 60 inches but may range to 90 inches in the interior valleys of Curry County, Oregon.  The mean January temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F, mean July temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 210 days."
