  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with 10 to 18 percent noncarbonate clay, 3 to 12 percent carbonate clay, and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser, excluding rock fragments.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent throughout and are mainly angular pebbles or channers.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at the paralithic contact is 41 degrees F. and is never moist in some or all parts for as long as 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature at the paralithic contact is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cummulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the soil temperature at the paralithic contact is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.  Hue is 10R to 5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8. Some pedons have crystals and threads of gypsum inherited from the parent material.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr is soft, red, calcareous siltstone interbedded with redshale.  It commonly is more than 20 feet thick.  Discontinuous layers of hard bedrock are present in some strata."

Canyon, Epping, Gerst, Shingle, Tassel, and Taluce soils have hues of 7.5YR or yellower.  Klondike soils have more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser excluding rock fragments.  Picante and Sandoval soils have hue of 10YR or yellower.  Spearfish soils are moist in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature is 41 degrees or more at the paralithic contact."

They formed in residuum derived from red sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in April, May, and June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 51 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 6,600 feet.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."
