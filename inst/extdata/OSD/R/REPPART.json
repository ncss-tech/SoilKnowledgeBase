Volume of rock fragments ranges from 5 to 30 percent in the upper 40 inches of pedon and increases with increased depth below 40 inches. Estimated CaC03 equivalent including 3/4 inch gravel is 40 to 70 percent below depth of 10 inches. The hue is 10YR through 5Y. Reppart soils are usually moist but are dry for periods of as long as one month in July or August. Mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. Average summer soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F. under grass or 45 to 47 degrees F. under dense forest canopy."
