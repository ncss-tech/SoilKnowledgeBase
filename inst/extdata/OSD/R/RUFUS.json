  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rufus series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from metasedimentary bedrock, and modified by till, volcanic ash and/or loess. These soils are mostly on glaciated hillsides, mountainsides and ridgetops. Slopes are 8 to 65 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 610 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",

Slopes are convex or complex and range from 8 to 65 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from metasedimentary bedrock, and modified by till, volcanic ash and/or loess.  These soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 375 to 760 mm. The mean annual temperature is 7.0 to 11.0 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 140 days."

Aits, Dehart, Scoap, and Stevens soils are more than 150 cm deep. Aits soils are on glaciated mountains. Dehart soils are on mountains. Scoap soils are frigid and are on uplands and mountainsides. Huckleberry soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal, are cryic and are on mountains. Maki, Oxerine, and Raisio soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to a lithic contact. Maki soils are on south facing glaciated uplands and mountainsides. Stevens soils are coarse-loamy and are on south facing hillsides, rounded hilltops, mountainsides and ridgetops."
