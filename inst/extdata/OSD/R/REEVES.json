  "OVERVIEW": "The Reeves series consists of very deep soils that are moderately deep to gypsum material.  They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous and gypsiferous fine textured alluvium derived from gypsum beds.  These soils are on hillslopes, plateaus, and basin floors with slopes ranging from 0 to 9 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

Field study and additional data indicates that both \"Ustic\" and \"Calcic\" were mapped together in the past, but that more acres fit the \"Calcic\" subgroup.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL characterization data; Lab No. 70L364-70L371 and 70L372-70L376\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
