Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent, but they range up to 9 percent.  The parent material is calcareous impure gypsum beds.  The climate is arid to semiarid with average rainfall of 10 to 15 inches.  The driest period occurs between late October and May.  The average annual temperature is 58 to 64 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from 180 to 230 days."

Field study and additional data indicates that both \"Ustic\" and \"Calcic\" were mapped together in the past, but that more acres fit the \"Calcic\" subgroup.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL characterization data; Lab No. 70L364-70L371 and 70L372-70L376\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
