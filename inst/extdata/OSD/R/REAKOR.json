  "OVERVIEW": "The Reakor series is very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Reakor soils are on broad plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and average annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

Slopes are plane and mostly of less than one percent gradient ranging to 5 percent.  The soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured material high in carbonates that is mostly of alluvial origin from limestone, with small amounts of eolian material.  This climate is arid to semiarid with average rainfall of 8 to 12 inches.  The average annual temperature is 57 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 180 to 215 days."

Holloman and Reeves soils have gypsum at depths of less than 40 inches.  Lozier soils are on low limestone hills and are shallow to limestone bedrock."
