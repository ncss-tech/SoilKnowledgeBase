Slopes are plane and mostly of less than one percent gradient ranging to 5 percent.  The soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured material high in carbonates that is mostly of alluvial origin from limestone, with small amounts of eolian material.  This climate is arid to semiarid with average rainfall of 8 to 12 inches.  The average annual temperature is 57 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 180 to 215 days."

Atoka, Tencee and Upton soils have petrocalcic horizons and occur on ridges.  Bigetty and Pecos soils are on floodplains and have thick mollic epipedons.  Holloman and Reeves soils have gypsum at depths of less than 40 inches.  Lozier soils are on low limestone hills and are shallow to limestone bedrock."
