They are moist in some parts of the moisture control section for 35 to 50 days during the summer months and are dry for 60 to 75 days during the 120 days following winter solstice.\nThe depth to sandstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches, the upper 1 to 3 inches is weathered over hard bedrock.  The combined thickness of the A and Bw Horizons ranges from 10 to 16 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 50 percent cobbles and gravel.  It is noncalcareous or slightly effervescent and mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It commonly is cobbly loam, but the range includes cobbly fine sandy loam, and cobbly sandy clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent cobbles.\nThe Bk or BC horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry.  It commonly is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent.  The BC horizon is strongly or violently effervescent and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
