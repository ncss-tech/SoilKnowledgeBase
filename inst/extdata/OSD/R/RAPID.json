  "OVERVIEW": "The Rapid series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium weathered from rhyolite.  Rapid soils are on side slopes of canyons and have slopes of 20 to 85 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.5 degrees C.",
