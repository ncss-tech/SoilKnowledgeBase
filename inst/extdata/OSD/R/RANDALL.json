It includes knotgrass, bur ragweed, sedges, spike rushes, smartweed, saltmarsh aster, curly dock, frog-fruit, and bushy knotweed. In areas of standing water longbarb arrowhead, soft-stem bulrush and southern cattail may be present. Around the margins, where ponding occurs for shorter periods the woody vegetation includes western willow and some cottonwood.
