  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to the natric horizon ranges from 16 to 36 inches.  Calcium to magnesium ratio of the Bt horizons is less than 1.  Reaction of the soil ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid, except the surface layer in areas that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon and the Btg horizon either have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 with few to many medium or coarse mottles in shades of brown, red, or yellow; or they are mottled in these colors.  Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The upper part of the B horizon has 18 to 30 percent clay.  The E part of the B/E horizon consists of silty tongues that commonly are highly leached and have a low content of clay.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1.  It is silt loam or loam high in silt."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Closely related series are the Bonn, Foley, Hillemann, Lafe, McCrory, Peoria, and Verdun series.  Bonn, Foley, Hillemann, Lafe, Peoria, and Verdun soils have a fine-silty particle-size class and have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Bonn and Verdun soils have a calcium to magnesium ratio of more than 1 and more than 15 percent sodium saturation throughout the argillic horizon; Foley soils are neutral to strongly alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon; Hillemann soils have more than 15 percent sodium saturation throughout the argillic horizon; Lafe soils have a matrix with chroma of more than 2 in the upper part of the Bt horizon and more than 15 percent sodium saturation throughout the argillic horizon.  McCrory soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rosella soils are on stream terraces adjacent to rivers and their tributaries of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  These are nearly level soils with slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent.  The surfaces are a plane or slightly concave.  The regolith consists of loamy marine or fluvatile sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 66 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual precipitation is 59 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Mashulaville, Prentiss, Savannah, Stough, and Trebloc soils.  The poorly drained Mashulaville and moderately well drained Prentiss and Savannah soils have a fragipan; in addition, Mashulaville and Prentiss soils are coarse-loamy in the particle-size control section.  Mashulaville soils are in similar positions as the Rosella soils.  Prentiss and Savannah soils are on higher positions in the terrain on hillsides and ridgetops.  The somewhat poorly drained Stough soils, which are coarse-loamy in the particle-size control section, are in slightly higher positions. Poorly drained Trebloc soils, which are fine-silty in the control section, are in similar positions as the Rosella soils and, in addition, are on flood plains."
