  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  Depth to the contrasting substratum ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 0 to 60 percent in individual layers of the substratum.  Typically, 70 percent or more of the rock fragments are rounded pebbles.  Unless limed, the soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid above a depth of 40 inches and very strongly acid to slightly acid below 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Undisturbed pedons have a 3 to 8 inch thick A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap or A horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Chroma of 3 and 4 is limited to subhorizons and chroma of 1 or 2 is in some subhorizon within a 20 inch depth.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  Structure is weak subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.  Consistency is friable or very friable and nonsticky or slightly sticky.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture of individual layers ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand in the fine earth.\nSome pedons have a thin C or BC horizon that is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or fine sandy loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series currently in the same family.\nThe Fredon, Halsey, Lamson, Leicester, Massena, Newstead, Ninigret, Norwell, Raynham, Red Hook, Ridgebury, Stissing, Sun, Tisbury and Walpole series are similar soils in related families.  Fredon soils are nonacid. Halsey soils are nonacid and lack a subhorizon with chroma of 3 or more within a 30 inch depth.  Lamson, Massena, Newstead, Red Hook, Ridgebury and Sun soils are nonacid and coarse-loamy.  Leicester and Stissing soils are coarse-loamy and Stissing soils have a dense substratum. Ninigret and Tisbury soils have matrix chroma of 3 or more in the B horizon to a depth of 20 inches.  Norwell and Walpole soils have a sandy particle-size control section.  In addition, Norwell soils have a dense substratum.  Raynham soils are nonacid and coarse-silty."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Raypol soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils in drainageways and low-lying areas on terraces and plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in loamy over sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial materials derived mainly from acid cystalline and sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 37 to 50 inches and the growing season is 130 to 195 days."

The well drained Enfield and Haven soils and the moderately well drained Tisbury soils are common drainage associates.        Agawam, Branford and Ellington soils are better drained                     loamy over sandy and gravelly soils.  Deerfield, Hartford,                 Hinckley, Manchester, Merrimac, Sudbury and Windsor soils                   are moderately well drained to excessively drained coarse-                  textured soils on nearby glaciofluvial landforms. Occum, Pootatuck and Rippowam soils are on flood plains."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision reflects change in taxonomy from Aeric Haplaquepts and general updating.  Cation exchange activity class placement determined from a review of limited lab data and similar or associated soils.\nThe horizons and features diagnostic for the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon from 8 to 29 inches (Bg and Bw horizons).\n3. Aquic moisture regime as indicated by dominant chroma of 2 in the Bg horizon but with chroma too high within 30 inches (chroma 4 in the Bw horizon) to qualify for Typic Endoaquepts.\n4. Endoaquepts subgroup based on saturation in all layers from the upper boundary of saturation to a depth of 200 cm. from the mineral soil surface.\n5. Aeric great group based on matrix color and chroma of 3 or more in one subhorizon between the Ap and 75 cm. (Bw2).\n6. Particle-size  class: control section from 10 to 40 inches that is coarse-loamy from 10 to 29 inches and contrasting sandy or sandy-skeletal from 29 to 60 inches.\n7. Acid reaction class and mesic temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
