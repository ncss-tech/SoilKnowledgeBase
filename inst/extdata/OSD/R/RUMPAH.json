Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 2400 to 2700 feet.  The climate is arid with hot summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches with relatively even monthly distribution with slight peaks in January and August; mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 200 to 220 days"
