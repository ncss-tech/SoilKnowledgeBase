  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Raglan soils are on basin floor remnants, alluvial flat remnants, lake plain terraces, and fan skirts.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,220 to 1,770 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 230 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
