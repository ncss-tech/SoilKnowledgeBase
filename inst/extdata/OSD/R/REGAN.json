  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section typically averages between 27 and 35 percent clay, and ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Some pedons have a conductivity of 4 to 15 mmhos/cm.  The mollic epipedon commonly is 7 to 12 inches thick, but ranges to as much as 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  It has weak or moderate subangular blocky or granular structure, slight to strong effervescence, and some pedons contain salt crystals. Some pedons have an ABk horizon and Ab horizons.\nThe Bk horizon has 10YR, 5Y, or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It has weak or moderate grades of prismatic, subangular blocky or granular structure and 15 to 55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are in the lower part of the horizon in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has 5Y hue, rarely 2.5Y or 10YR hue, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Horizons with chroma of 2 or 3 have distinct or prominent redoximorphic features of 5GY, 5Y or 2.5Y hue and chroma of 1 to 4.  Some have redoximorphic features of 10YR hue.  The 2C horizon typically is clay loam and sandy clay loam, but some are stratified and range from sandy loam through silty clay loam.  Some have sand or sand and gravel below depths of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bear Lake, Colvin, Nielsville, Ojata and Winger series.  Bear Lake soils are on elevations above 4500 feet and typically have a shorter frost-free season.  Colvin soils have more organic matter in the A horizon and typically have lower color values when moist.  In addition, they have less sand in the lower half of the control section and formed in silty lake sediments in a subhumid climate.  Nielsville soils have clay till at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Ojata soils are strongly saline with conductivity exceeding 15 mmhos/cm and have thinner sola.  Winger soils have higher mean annual precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Regan soils are on level, plane and slightly concave swales in uplands and on low terraces and bottomlands in stream valleys and outwash channels.  Slopes  ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in silty alluvium overlying stratified coarser alluvium.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 34 to 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation from 12 to 18 inches."

All of these except Harriet soils are well drained and do not have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches.  Harriet soils are on the same terrace and swales as Regan soils in a few areas. They have natric horizons."

Aquifers of lignite or sand and gravel carry water from higher land to these soils.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow."
