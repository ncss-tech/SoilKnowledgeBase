  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 32 to 70 inches. The mollic epipedon is 16 to 32 inches thick and extends into the upper Bt horizon.  Soil salinity is 0.5 to 4 mmhos/cm and remains constant or increases with depth.  In irrigated areas some pedons have a salinity of 4 to 16 mmhos/cm.\nThe A horizon is gray (10YR 5/1), dark gray (10YR 4/1), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Structure is weak granular or fine subangular blocky.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is very dark gray (10YR 3/1; N 3/0), dark gray (10YR 4/1; N 4/0), gray (10YR 5/1; N 5/0), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  Few, common, or many prominent or distinct mottles are reddish brown (5YR 5/4), yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 5/8), brownish yellow (10YR 6/6, 6/8), and strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) where matrices have chromas of 2.  It is a clay or clay loam with clay content of 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is gray (10YR 6/1; N 5/0, 6/0), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or very pale brown (10YR 7/3). It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.  Calcium carbonate content ranges from 1 to about 5 percent by weight."

Carwile and Muldrow soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  Clareville and Racombes soils as well as Orelia soils have less than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.   Orelia soils have a surface horizon that is very hard and massive."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rio soils are on nearly level to depressional areas of coastal uplands.  Slope gradients are less than 0.5 percent.  The soil formed in fine textured\nsediments of deltic or alluvial origin.  The climate is dry subhumid to semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from about 18 to 34 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 72 to 75 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 310 to 350 days and elevation ranges from 5 to 500 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 22 to 44."

Racombes soils occur in drainageways at slightly higher elevations.  Brennan, Hidalgo, Pharr, Raycombes, and Willacy soils occur on adjacent uplands and have less than 35 percent clay in their control sections and have no mottles due to wetness.  Tiocano soils occur in similar positions and are clayey throughout and have intersecting slickensides."
