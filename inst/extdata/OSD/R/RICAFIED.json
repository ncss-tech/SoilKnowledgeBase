  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ricafied series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone and dolomite, with some loess influence. Ricafied soils are on mountain slopes, hillslopes, and ridges. Slope ranges from 15 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
