  "OVERVIEW": "The Rexburg series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium derived from loess.  They are on loess covered fan terraces, foothills, and basalt plains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
