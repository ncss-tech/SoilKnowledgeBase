  "OVERVIEW": "The Rito consists of very deep, well drained soils in mixed alluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, shales, and siliceous conglomerate.  Rito soils are on alluvial fans and valley bottoms. Slopes are 4 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual soil temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
