These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of more than 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples and averages 35 to 65 percent pumice and ranges from 15 to 95 percent pumice.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 to 8 when dry, 3 to 7 when moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 when dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 when dry, 3 to 5 when moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 when dry or moist.  It is very fine sandy loam, very paragravelly ashy sandy loam, paragravelly ashy sandy loam, very paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam, extremely paragravelly ashy sandy loam or paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe C, 2C and 3C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6, 7 or 8 when dry, 5 to 8 when moist, and chroma of 1 to 8 when dry or moist.  They average 50 to 95 percent pumice.  Thin lenses of volcanic sand size ash occur in some profiles.\nThe 4Bwb horizon has value of 6 or 7 when dry, 5 or 6 when moist, and chroma of 2 to 6 when dry or moist.  It contains 0 to 15 percent pumice."

These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice underlain by granodiorite or glacial till.  Elevations are 2,500 to 5,800 feet.  The climate is characterized  by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 to 40 inches; the average annual temperature is about 42 to 45 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F. is about 130 to 170 days."
