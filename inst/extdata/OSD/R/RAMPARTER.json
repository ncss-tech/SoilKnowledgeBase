The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of more than 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples and averages 35 to 65 percent pumice and ranges from 15 to 95 percent pumice.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 to 8 when dry, 3 to 7 when moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 when dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 when dry, 3 to 5 when moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 when dry or moist.  It is very fine sandy loam, very paragravelly ashy sandy loam, paragravelly ashy sandy loam, very paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam, extremely paragravelly ashy sandy loam or paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe C, 2C and 3C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6, 7 or 8 when dry, 5 to 8 when moist, and chroma of 1 to 8 when dry or moist.
