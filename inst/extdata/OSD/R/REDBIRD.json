  "OVERVIEW": "The Redbird series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from limestone and calcareous sandstone on open parks in mountains.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
