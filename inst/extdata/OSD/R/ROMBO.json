  "STATES": "CO,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rombo series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed from colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from shale.  Rombo soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",
