  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to horizons that contain more than 5 percent plinthite ranges from 25 to 58 inches.  Strongly cemented to indurated iron oxide concretions less than 2 cm in diameter range from 15 to 35 percent in the A horizons, from 10 to 35 percent in the B21t and from 0 to 10 percent in the lower Bt horizons.\nThe A1 horizon has hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma from 2 through 4.  The A2 has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value from 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The A horizon is gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loamy fine sand, or gravelly loamy sand.  It is strongly acid or medium acid.  When the A horizon is loamy sand, it is less than 20 inches thick.\nThe B21t and B22t horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma from 4 through 8.  Mottles range from none to many with hues of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chromas of 6 through 8.  The B23t and B24t horizons have the same colors as the upper B2t horizons, and in addition, contain few to many mottles with a hue of 10YR, value from 5 through 7, and chromas of 1 to 2.\nThe B23t and B24t horizons contain 5 to 20 percent plinthite.  The B2t horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam throughout, or their gravelly counterparts, with a clay content ranging from 20 to 35 percent.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid."

Baxterville, Bowie, Cuthbert, Dothan, Malbis, and Pinetucky soils contain less than 15 percent concretions of ironstone.  Conroe and Sunsweet soils contain more than 35 percent clay in their control sections, and in addition, Conroe soils have sandy A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Doucette, Fuquay, Lilbert, and Rentzel soils contain less than 15 percent concretions of ironstone and have sandy A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  In addition, Rentzel soils have low chroma mottles due to wetness within 30 inches of the surface.  Tifton soils contain less than 20 percent silt in the control section and are dry in the moisture control section for less than 75 cumulative days.  Notcher soils have thinner A horizons, lack A2 horizons and have apparent water table within 3 to 4 feet depth while Rogan soils have a perched water table above the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rogan soils are on nearly level to sloping uplands of the Coastal Plain.  The soil formed in thick beds of unconsolidated loamy sediments of Pleistocene age, mainly from the Willis formation.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent, but are mainly 2 to 4 percent.  The climate is humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches.  Summer rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Summer moisture deficit ranges from 0 to 4 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 degrees to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E index exceeds 72."

Pinetucky soils are on similar landscape positions, but contain less than 15 percent iron oxide concretions in the A horizon.  Doucette soils are on slightly higher interstream divides.  Boykin and Shankler soils are on similar or more sloping landscape positions and have loamy fine sand A horizons greater than 20 inches thick.  Urland soils are on slightly higher smooth slopes, contain less than 5 percent plinthite, and have redder hues."
