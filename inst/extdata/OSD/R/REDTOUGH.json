The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May to about November (150 to 80 days).  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel and cobbles.  Mineralogy is mixed.  A fluctuating, water table can occur between the top of the duripan and 2 inches, (5 cm) below the surface of the soil from November through March.  Redoximorphic features such as oxidized iron masses and manganese masses occur in the Bt horizon and manganese surface coats occur in layers 1/8 to 1/4 inches (3 to 5 mm) thick on top of the duripan.  Some pedons have soft oxidized iron masses in the A horizon.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Some pedons have 1/16 inch, (2 mm) thick organic crust on the surface.\nThe A horizon dry color is 5YR 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/6, 7.5YR 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/3, 5YR 3/3, 3/4 or 2.5YR 3/4.  Texture is loam or gravelly loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 22 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.
