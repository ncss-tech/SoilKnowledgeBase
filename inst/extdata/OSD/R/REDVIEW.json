  "OVERVIEW": "The Redview series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium from limestone, shale and sandstone. Redview soils occur on alluvial fans and basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 C.",
