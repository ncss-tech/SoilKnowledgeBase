    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ratto soils are on lava plateaus and fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks in Oregon and in alluvium derived from mixed rocks strongly influenced by the Newark Canyon Formation in Nevada.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,780 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm that comes primarily as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of March 2004 updates the taxonomic class from Clayey, smectitic, frigid, shallow Haploxeralfic Argidurids based on use of the series in Oregon.  The type location is moved to a more representative area in Lake County, Oregon.  Future study is needed of the Ratto soils as mapped in Eureka County, Nevada to determine both the degree of cementation in the duripan and whether the typical depth class is actually moderately deep instead of shallow.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A and AB horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 33 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 33 to 152 cm (Bk, 2Bkqm, and 2Bk horizons).\nDuripan - The zone from 38 to 48 cm (2Bkqm horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 33 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
