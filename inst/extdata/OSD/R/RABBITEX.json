  "OVERVIEW": "The Rabbitex series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum weathered from calcareous sedimentary rocks. Rabbitex soils are on structural benches, mountainsides and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 6 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Emmons soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, a calcic horizon at 8 to 20 inches, and do not have a lithic contact. Headwaters soils have a calcic horizon at 5 to 13 inches and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Rothican, Rothiemay and Zinzer soils do not have a lithic contact. Zinzer soils also have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 9,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 20 inches, which is evenly distributed in forms of rain and snow.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period varies from 70 to 120 days.  In Utah the frost free-period is as low as 50 days."
