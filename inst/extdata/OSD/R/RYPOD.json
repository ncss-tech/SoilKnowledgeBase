The mean summer soil temperature is 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.\nThe mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick, and extends into the upper part of the argillic horizon. The solum above the layer of carbonate accumulation is 25 to 46 inches thick. The depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 30 to 50 percent in the A horizon; 35 to 50 percent in the Bt horizon; 35 to 60 percent in the Bk and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It is stony loam, very gravelly loam, gravelly loam or very cobbly loam. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam. The horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline and ranges from 15 to 25 inches thick. Lower subhorizons have calcium carbonate equivalent ranging from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4. They are gravelly clay loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam, very gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly sand. These horizons are slightly to moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 20 percent in the Bk horizons and 5 to 10 percent in the C horizons."

These soils formed in residuum, colluvium and alluvium from mixed intermediate igneous rocks. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
