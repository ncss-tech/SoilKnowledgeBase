  "OVERVIEW": "The Rypod series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks. Rypod soils occur on mountain slopes, foothills and old dissected alluvial fans, and have slopes of 15 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
