  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is 20 to 30 inches and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon but ranges from 7 to 40 inches.  Combined thickness of the A and E horizon is more than 5 inches.  The exchangeable magnesium plus sodium is more than half of the total CEC within a depth of 16 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry.  It typically is silt loam, but some pedons are silty clay loam or loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 2 to 4 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam and neutral to slightly acid.  Some pedons have a B/E horizon.  Some pedons have an A/E horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay and clay loam. Some pedons have columnar tops but they are degraded 1/2 inch to 1 inch. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btnkz horizon has hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.  It is mildly to strongly alkaline.  Accumulations of gypsum and other salts are not in some pedons.  Few or common, faint to prominent mottles are in the lower part of most pedons.\nThe Bkz horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It is slightly to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have Bk or BC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and commonly has thin strata of coarser textured materials, especially below 40 inches.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  Accumulations of carbonate and salts are in most pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Ranslo soils formed in clayey alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 14 to 20 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 155 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches; and growing degree days are about 2600 to 3300."

Harriet soils are in micro-lows in complex with Ranslo soils.  Bowbells and Grassna soils lack natric horizons and are in swales. Miranda, Niobell, and Noonan soils are fine-loamy and are on nearby uplands."
