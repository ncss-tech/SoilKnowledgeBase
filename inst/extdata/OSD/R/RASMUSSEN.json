  "OVERVIEW": "The Rasmussen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess or loess influenced slope alluvium from basalt. Rasmussen soils are on valley floors and hills. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 650 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.7 degrees C.",
