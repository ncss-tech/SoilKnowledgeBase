  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockybar series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in glacial outwash from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Rockybar soils are on outwash terraces and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
