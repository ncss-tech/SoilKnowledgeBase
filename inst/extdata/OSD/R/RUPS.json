  "OVERVIEW": "The Rups series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils. These nearly level soils, on flood plains, formed in silty, saline Recent alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches.",
