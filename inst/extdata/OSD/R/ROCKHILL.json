  "REVDATE": "10/2008",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Rockhill series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in argillite and quartzite colluvium or residuum with a mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on mountains. Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
