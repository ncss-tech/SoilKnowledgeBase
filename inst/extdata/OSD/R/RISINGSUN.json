  "STATES": "OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Risingsun series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that are deep to dense till. They formed in herbaceous organic material, loamy and sandy glaciolacustrine sediments, and the underlying till. These soils are on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Ottokee soils are moderately well drained, have an ochric epipedon, and are on convex knolls and ridges. The poorly drained Rollersville and Wauseon soils have a mollic epipedon and are on planar surfaces. Tedrow soils are somewhat poorly drained, have an ochric epipedon, and are on slight convex rises. Toussaint (T) soils have an ochric epipedon and more than 35 percent clay in the cambic horizon."
