  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Risingsun soils are on lake plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope gradient is less than 1 percent. The soils formed in herbaceous organic material, loamy and sandy glaciolacustrine sediments, and the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hoytville, Ottokee, Rollersville, Tedrow, Toussaint (T), and Wauseon soils. Hoytville soils have an ochric epipedon, an argillic horizon, and between 40 and 55 percent clay in the particle-size control section. They are on slightly higher parts of the lake plain. Ottokee soils are moderately well drained, have an ochric epipedon, and are on convex knolls and ridges. The poorly drained Rollersville and Wauseon soils have a mollic epipedon and are on planar surfaces. Tedrow soils are somewhat poorly drained, have an ochric epipedon, and are on slight convex rises. Toussaint (T) soils have an ochric epipedon and more than 35 percent clay in the cambic horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or moderately high in the organic material, high in the loamy and sandy material, moderately low in the lower part of the solum formed in till, and low in the dense till. Permeability is moderately rapid to moderately slow in the organic material, moderately rapid in the loamy and sandy material, moderately slow or slow in the lower part of the solum formed in till, and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till."
