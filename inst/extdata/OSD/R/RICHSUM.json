  "OVERVIEW": "The Richsum series are deep and very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on high tablelands, low mountains and valley sides.  They formed in residuum, slope alluvium and valley side alluvium derived from shale, sandstone, and conglomerate.  Slopes range from 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",
