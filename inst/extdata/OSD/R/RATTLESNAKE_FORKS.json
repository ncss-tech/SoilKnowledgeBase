  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of sand and seasonal high saturation is 80 inches or more.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.  Depth to lamellae ranges from 30 to 72 inches.  Cumulative thickness of lamellae ranges from 1 cm to 15 cm.  Content of silt-plus-clay in the 10 to 40-inch control section ranges from 10 to 25 percent. Some pedons contain few quartz pebbles. Pebble and cobble-sized nodules and concretions of iron and manganese cemented sand on the surface and throughout the profile range from none to common.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Streaks and pockets of uncoated sand grains range from none to many.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe E part of the E&Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Sand grains are mostly uncoated.  The B part (lamellae) of the E&Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The lamellae range from 1 to 75 mm thick and range from 1 cm to more than 1 m in horizontal length.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture is sand or fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Alpin, Catpoint, Duffern, and Hainesville series in the same family.  The excessively drained Alpin and Duffern soils have fewer fines in the control section.  The somewhat excessively drained Catpoint and Hainesville soils are on terrace positions of large streams and have a seasonal water table between depths of 48 to 72 inches.  In addition, Hainesville soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 cumulative days in most years."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rattlesnake Forks soils are on dissected uplands.  They formed in thick beds of sandy fluvial and marine deposits.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 57 to 62 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 70 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Blanton, Lakeland, Maubila, Olla, Rutan and Toinette series.  Blanton, Lakeland Maubila and Olla soils lack lamellae.   Blanton and Toinette soils are on similar positions and have argillic horizons thicker than 7.5cm.  In addition, Blanton soils have an argillic horizon between 40 and 80 inches deep and Toinette soils have a sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness. The excessively drained Lakeland soils are on similar to higher positions and do not have lamellae.  The moderately well drained Maubila soils are on similar to lower positions and have clayey control sections.  The well-drained Rutan and Olla soils are on similar positions but have coarse-loamy and fine-loamy control sections, respectively."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas of Rattlesnake Forks soils are planted to pine.  Some small areas have been cleared and are used for pasture and crops.  The native vegetation consists of mixed, longleaf pine, slash pine, water oak, sweetgum, turkey oak, blackjack oak, and bluejack oak.  The understory is dominated by sparkleberry, yaupon holly, bluestem, low panicums, smilax and native annual forbs."

This concept provides for sandy soils that have lamellae that total less than 6 inches thick within depths of 80 inches.\nDepth to seasonal water table is more than 80 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization pedon - Washington County, Alabama S10AL-126-005(1-7).
