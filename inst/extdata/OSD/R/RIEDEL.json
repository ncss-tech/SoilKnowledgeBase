    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  The depth to soft sedimentary beds ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Color hues are 10YR or 2.5Y.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline, and is slightly or strongly effervescent.\nThe upper C horizons have value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are is mildly or moderately alkaline and are strongly or violently effervescent.\nThe lower C horizon is soft sedimentary beds that are mainly soft sandstone that retains rock structure but has roots in cracks and between and through plates.  This horizon is partially root-limiting and has common roots in the upper part and few below depths of 24 to 30 inches.  Some pedons have lenses of harder rock but have fractures which roots go through and develop in the underlying softer material."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blackhall, Blazon, Byrnie, Cabbart, Seaverson, Shinbara and Thermopolis series.  Blackhall soils have a paralithic contact that doesn't allow roots to enter the underlying rock and in addition have a growing season of less than 90 days.  Blazon, Cabbart, Seaverson and Shinbara soils have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Also, Shinbara soils are 2 to 10 inches deep to sedimentary beds.  Byrnie and Thermopolis soils have hue of 5YR through 10YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Riedel soils are moderately sloping to steep and are on uplands at elevations of 2,500 to 4,500 feet.  They formed in material weathered from soft sandstone sedimentary beds.  The climate is cool, dry-semiarid, continental, with long cold winters and moist springs.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls in spring or early summer.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F.  The (32 degree F.) growing season is 105 to 125 days."

Delpoint and Twilight soils have sedimentary beds at depths of 20 to 40 inches and are on ridges and hillsides.  Cabbart soils are on similar positions in the landscape."
