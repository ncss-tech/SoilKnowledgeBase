  "OVERVIEW": "The Rumblecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till and drift.  These soils are on moraines, till plains, hills, escarpments and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
