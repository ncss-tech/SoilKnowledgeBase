  "OVERVIEW": "The Rapson series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy over loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. Rapson soils are on lake plains, glacial deltas, glacial drainageways, and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 817 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

These areas require further study to characterize the cementing agent and soil chemistry of the profile.\nA dense substratum phase is recognized.\nA phase with a surface layer of human transported materials has been correlated. This layer is less than 50 cm thick and of variable textures."
