Wixom soils have less very fine sand and silt in the C horizon."

These areas require further study to characterize the cementing agent and soil chemistry of the profile.\nA dense substratum phase is recognized.\nA phase with a surface layer of human transported materials has been correlated. This layer is less than 50 cm thick and of variable textures.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
