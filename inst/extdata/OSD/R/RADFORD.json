  "OVERVIEW": "The Radford series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on flood plains. These soils formed in recent silt loam alluvium underlain by buried soils. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
