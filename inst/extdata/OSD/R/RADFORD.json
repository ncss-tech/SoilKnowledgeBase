These soils formed in dark colored, silt loam alluvium 20 to 40 inches thick underlain by buried, dark colored soils formed in older alluvium. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation varies from 30 to 45 inches."

Arenzville, Huntsville, and Lawson soils are in similar positions on the flood plain nearby. Littleton, Raddle, and Worthen soils are in positions upslope from Radford soils on terraces or foot slopes. Arenzville soils do not have a mollic epipedon and Huntsville, Littleton and Worthen soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2 feet below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Permeability is moderate. Flooding from stream overflow is rare to common for brief periods between November and June."
