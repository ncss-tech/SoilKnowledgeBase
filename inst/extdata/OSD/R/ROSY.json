  "OVERVIEW": "The Rosy series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy glaciofluvial or lacustrine materials. They are on lake plains and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils have moderate permeability.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Free carbonates begin at depths greater than 28 inches, commonly in the lower part of the solum or just below it.  Some pedons have as much as 3 percent of fine pebbles by volume, mainly as one or more very thin lag lines.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  The C horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a discontinuous A horizon as much as 2 inches thick. It has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where present, and Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizons are very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.  Some pedons have E/B horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and dominant chroma of 3 or 4 with some chroma of 2 at depths less than 10 inches below the upper boundary.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  It has thin or moderately thick clay films on faces of peds.\nThe 2E and Bt horizons typically have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Individual coarser textured strata include 2.5Y hue, value of 7, and chroma of 2.  Strata commonly are discontinuous over short horizontal distances.  Thickness of individual strata range from about 1/4 inch to 12 inches, and commonly is 2 to 5 inches. Textures are typically loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or sandy loam with thin coarser textured strata including loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, and sand.\nSome pedons have 2Bk horizons which have white or light gray segregated lime as masses that are rounded or thread-like.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are stratified consisting of sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam."
