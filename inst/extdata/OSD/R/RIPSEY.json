  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Delgado (CA), Langwell (CA), Splanod (AZ), Tidwell (AZ) and Trigger (CA) series. Delgado soils occur in MLRA 15, are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September and formed from sandstone and shale.  Langwell and Trigger soils are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  Splanod soils have greater than 18 percent clay.  Tidwell soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods due to a lower rainfall component.\nTrigger soils have fractured bedrock above the lithic contact and should be classified as shallow typic torriorthents."
