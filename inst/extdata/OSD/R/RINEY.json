  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 80 inches. Depth to soft reddish sandstone ranges from 4 to more than 10 feet. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the surface layer and very strongly or strongly acid in the solum and substratum, unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Severely eroded phases have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam. Quartzite or sandstone gravels, from 1/4 to 1 inch in diameter, range from 0 to 10 percent in the Ap, A, AB or E horizons.\nThe A horizon, where present, is 1 to 4 inches thick, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam or sandy loam.\nThe AB or E horizons, where present, are 4 to 8 inches thick, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. Some pedons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR in the upper part and lithomorphic mottles in shades of red or brown in lower part. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam. Quartzite or sandstone gravels, 1/4 to 1 inch in diameter, range from 0 to 20 percent in the upper part and 0 to 40 percent in the lower part.\nThe C horizon and the BC or CB horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy sand. Quartzite or sandstone gravels range from 0 to 40 percent. Some pedons are underlain by weakly consolidated sandstone, which crushes easily to the above mentioned textures."

Alonzville soils have colors of 7.5YR to 2.5Y in the solum. The Bailegap and Beersheba soils formed in residuum over soft sandstone. Bailegap soils have hard sandstone fragments throughout their solums. Beersheba, Gunstock, Harmiller, and Lily soils are moderately deep. Hambrook soils formed in stratified coastal plain alluvial or marine sediments. Jefferson soils formed in colluvium on steep hillsides, mountainsides and foot slopes commonly associated with sandstone escarpments. Keener soils formed in loamy colluvium weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks that are low in weatherable minerals. Lonewood soils formed in a silty mantle 1 to 3 feet thick over residuum weathered from shale or sandstone. Marr soils formed in regolith of unconsolidated coastal plain sediments. McCamy soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper solum that weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as arkose, arkosic sandstone, quartzite, graywacke, metasiltstone or metasandstone. Raftville soils formed in colluvium and stream alluvium and have a lithologic discontinuity. Sassafras soils formed in sandy marine and old alluvial coastal plain deposits and they have solum thickness of 25 to 50 inches. Sunnyside soils formed in unconsolidated sandy coastal plain deposits, they have solum thickness of 24 to 48 inches, and a maximum depth of the argillic within 40 inches."
