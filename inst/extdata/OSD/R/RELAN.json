Average texture of the 10- to 40-inch section is loam or sandy loam with 7 to 18 percent clay, more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand and 15 to 30 percent fine gravel of porcelanite fragments. The hue is 7.5YR and redder with chroma of 2 through 4.  The Ap and A1 horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry.  The Cca horizon is weak with few to many segregations of thread and film lime and a CaC03 content of 8 to 12 percent.  Loose porcelanite beds occur at depths greater than 40 inches."

Bass, Groveland and Kalispell soils have udic summer moisture regime and have moist value of 2 in the A1 horizons.  Bass, Manning and Victor soils have very gravelly sandy substrata below depth of about 30 inches.  Also, Bass soils have considerable mica from included granitic rock fragments.  Bitterroot and Vebar soils have paralithic contacts with sandstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Hopley soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR. Panguitch soils have cambic horizons and are deeper than 18 inches to the Cca horizons.  Tally and Vebar soils have fine sandy loam pedons.  Twin Creek soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Relan soils are on terraces and alluvial fans and on floors of swales in the uplands.  The parent material is of mixed mineral origin, consisting of local transported materials from red porcelanite beds and soils developed over these beds.  The climate is cool semiarid with mean annual temperature colder than 45 degrees F. and mean summer temperature warmer than 65 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches with 9 to 12 inches falling during May to September."
