  "OVERVIEW": "The Rohrbeck series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a mantle of sandy eolian or outwash sediments, and the underlying calcareous loamy glacial till.  They are on convex and plane positions on moraines.  These soils have very rapid permeability in the sandy mantle, and moderately rapid permeability in the underlying loamy material.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.  Mean annual air temperature  is about 46 degrees F.",

Depth to free carbonates is between 30 and 50 inches.  Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The argillic horizon is formed in the glacial till, and averages between 16 and 24 percent clay.  Content of sand ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  That part of the solum developed in the sandy mantle has as much as 2 percent rock fragments consisting mostly of gravel and a few scattered cobbles.  The 2Bt horizon and the underlying glacial till have 8 to 15 percent by volume rock fragments ranging from mostly gravel and cobbles with a few widely scattered stones and boulders.  The rock fragments are of mixed lithology.\nThe Ap horizon has value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has value of 5 or 6 when dry.  An A horizon ranging from 4 to 8 inches thick is in non-cultivated areas.  They are loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has value of 6 when dry.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon in the upper part dominantly has hue of 10YR, with value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons have 2.5Y hue with value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4.  The lower part of the 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Low chroma Fe depletions range from few to common in the lower part of the horizon.  The 2Bt horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.   Ped exteriors have clay and organic matter coatings that range from few to common.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, chroma of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are few.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It has 12 to 18 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent sand.  It is slightly alkaline."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 26 to 28 inches.  The number of frost free days ranges from 145 to 155 days.

Well drained Koronis soils are formed entirely in loamy glacial till and are closely associated on nearby convex positions.  Poorly drained Granby soils are sandy to below 40 inch depth and are on plane and slightly concave positions.  Very poorly drained Lundlake soils formed entirely in glacial till."
