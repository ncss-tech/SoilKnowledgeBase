  "OVERVIEW": "The Rothican series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in gravelly, calcareous alluvium on relict fan aprons, fan pediments, and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches.  Depth to pedogenetic concentrations of secondary calcium carbonates and the calcic horizon range from 10 to 22 inches.  Coarse fragments throughout the particle size control section range from 15 to 35 percent pebbles.  Clay percent ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  At depths of 40 inches or greater coarse fragments range from 30 to 60 percent pebbles.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees F.  The soil is dry in some part of the moisture control section more than .6 of the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically loam and less typically a gravelly loam with less than 30 percent pebbles.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  EC ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos.\nThe Bw horizon, cambic horizon, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is a gravelly loam.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  EC is 0 to 2 mmhos.\nThe Bk horizon, calcic horizon, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is gravelly loam with carbonates coating the coarse fragments.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  EC is 0 to 2 mmhos.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is typically gravelly loam above 40 inches but may be very gravelly loam below 40 inches.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  EC is 0 to 2 mmhos."

Rothiemay soils have 15 to 60 percent clay size carbonates within the clay fraction and occur in 10- to 14-inch precipitation zones.  The Zinzer soils have control sections with 35 to 60 percent fine sand or coarser, 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments, and sandy clay loam textures.  They also occur in 7-inch precipitation zones."

Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The annual temperatures ranges from about 40 to 45 degrees F.  Annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 19 inches of which over half falls in March, April, May, and June.  Estimated frost-free season is 90 to 110 days but will vary depending upon aspect and air drainage."
