  "OVERVIEW": "The Rock River series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium derived mainly from sandstone, eolian deposits, and residuum.  Rock River soils are on alluvial fan aprons, relict terraces, benches, hillslopes, and areas of valley fill. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F.  EC is less than 4 mmhos throughout. The rock fragments in the soil are less than 3/4 inch in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam, averaging 20 to 35 percent clay and has more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent pebbles.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam modified with from 0 to 30 percent pebbles. Some pedons have textures of loamy sand or coarser below 40 inches.

Alcova and Bateson soils have very gravelly Bk and C horizons.  Almy, Forelle, Regnaps, and Stunner soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the B2t horizon. Alogia, Diamonkit, and Stylite soils have secondary accumulations of gypsum in the solum.  Anchutz,\nFonce, Grubrob, Hickey, and Wycolo soils have diagnostic calcic horizons. Antonito and Grubrob soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bluerim, Bonfri, Cushool, Cutback, Diamondville, Diamonkit, Harsha, Rawah, Satanka and Wycolo soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Fluetsch soils are very similar but have a mean summer soil temperature of about 55 degrees F.  Maysprings and Taffom soils are non-calcareous above 40 inches."

The soils formed in material weathered from calcareous sandstone, eolian deposits, and residuum.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Elevation is 5,900 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 75 to 110 days but varies according to aspect, elevation, and air drainage."
