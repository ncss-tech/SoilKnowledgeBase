  "OVERVIEW": "The Repp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from argillite, quartzite, siltstone or limestone. These soils are on mountain slopes and hills. Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
