    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years the soil is usually moist but is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for more than 60 consecutive days within the 3-month period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to secondary lime ranges from 20 to 43 inches.  The control section is silt loam with 18 to 24 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Rock fragments commonly are absent but range up to 2 percent in some lower horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak or moderate structure.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  It is moderately or strongly calcareous and has segregated and myceolial lime."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Calouse, Hunters, Kearns, Staley, and Valby series.  Calouse soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches.  Hunters soils have free carbonates in the lower part of the solum.  Kearns soils have mildly or moderately alkaline sola and lack any influence of ash.  Staley soils have secondary carbonates throughout the B horizon and are moderately or strongly alkaline in the B horizon.  Valby soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Rhea soils are on upland slopes at elevations of 1,600 to 3,200 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in loess with an appreciable component of volcanic ash.  The climate is semiarid with cool moist winters and dry summers.  The mean winter temperature is 31 to 35 degrees F., the summer temperature is 62 to 66 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The frost-free period (32 degrees F.) is 100 to 150 days."
