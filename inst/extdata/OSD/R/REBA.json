  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges in thickness from 22 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 49 degrees to 51 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from about March 15 to November 15 and above 47 degrees F. from about April 1 to November 1.  The soil between depths of about 6 to 14 inches is usually dry all of the time from about June 1 until November 15 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The soil is estimated to have about 1 to 3 percent organic matter to a depth of about 15 to 18 inches.  (See Remarks).  A desert pavement or a winnowed coarse sand covers the surface of parts or all of some pedons to a depth of 1/4 to 3 inches.  Rock fragments, mostly 1/4 to 3/4 inch in diameter, make up to 5 percent of the A and B horizons and up to 30 percent of the C horizon.  The soil is slightly to medium acid near the surface and becomes alkaline with depth.  The A1 horizon is light brownish gray or grayish brown (10YR 6/2, 5/2; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2).  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam with about 15 to 25 percent clay.  This horizon has vesicular porosity and octagonal cracks 6 to 8 inches apart.  The B2t horizon is grayish brown to light olive brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/3, 5/4).  It is clay and silty clay with about 40 to 45 percent clay and an increase of 15 to 20 percent more clay absolute than the overlying A horizon.  This horizon has columnar structure in the upper part and is prismatic to angular blocky in the lower portion.  In many pedons the upper surfaces of the columns is capped with an A2 horizon which varies from indistinct coatings to a distinct horizon 1/2 inch thick.  The C horizon is light yellowish brown to grayish brown (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/3, 6/4, 5/2) and is heavy sandy loam or loamy sand."

Gooding soils have a duripan over bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches.  Sorf soils have 45 to 60 percent clay in the B2t horizon and have clay loam C horizons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Reba soils are gently sloping to moderately steep and are on dissected fans at elevations of 4,500 to 5,200 feet.  They formed in old alluvium from mixed sources.  The climate is cool semiarid with cool dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is about 6 to 12 inches.  Average January temperature is 29 degrees F.; average July temperature is 69 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 48 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 60 to 90 days."
