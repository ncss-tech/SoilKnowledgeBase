  "OVERVIEW": "The Rentzel series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in sandy and loamy marine deposits derived from the Claiborne geological group.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in).",
