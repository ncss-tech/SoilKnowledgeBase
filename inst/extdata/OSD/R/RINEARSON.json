The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3 moist; 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4 moist; 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam but some pedons have thin layers of clay loam.  Weathered siltstone paragravel range from 5 to 25 percent and siltstone paracobbles from 0 to 10 percent.  It is extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam.  Weathered siltstone paragravel range from 15 to 35 percent and siltstone paracobbles range from 0 to 25 percent.  It is extremely acid through strongly acid."
