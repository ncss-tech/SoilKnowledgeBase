  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to siltstone typically is 24 to 32 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 12 inches.  In some native grass areas, pedons are leached of carbonate to a depth of 6 inches.  The control section typically is silt loam or silty clay loam estimated to average between 18 and 35 percent clay.  Some pedons have up to 15 percent by volume fragments of soft siltstone in the lower part of the subsoil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam or silt loam, and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk and By horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from an estimated 30 to 70 percent.  Accumulations of carbonate and gypsum typically range from few to many and fine to coarse.  Some pedons have AC or C horizons.\nThe Cr horizon is bedded siltstone in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Seams of gypsum are between fracture planes of the bedrock in most pedons and ranges up to 1/2 inch or more in thickness.  The bedded siltstone is rippable.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Redstoe soils are on nearly level to steep uplands.  Slopes are plane to convex.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 25 percent.  They formed in residuum derived from soft chalky siltstone of the Niobrara formation.  In some areas a thin mantle of glacial till is in the surface 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation range from 17 to 26 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Betts, Clarno, Delmont, Ethan,Firesteel, Gavins, and Hand soils. Betts, Ethan, and Gavins soils are on crests and upper side slopes of the ridges and knolls. Betts and Ethan soils formed in loamy glacial till. Gavins soils do not have a mollic epipedon. Clarno, Delmont, and Hand soils are on similar landscapes.  Clarno soils formed in glacial till, Delmont soils are shallow to sand and gravel and Hand soils formed in stratified loamy glacial meltwater deposits. Firesteel soils have a wetter moisture control section and are in swales and low areas."
