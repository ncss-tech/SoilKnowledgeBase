  "OVERVIEW": "The Rond soils consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in residuum from cherty limestone and limestone with some local influence from quartzite. Rond soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep plains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
