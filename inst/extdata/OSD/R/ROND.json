  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Rond soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep plains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. These soils are formed in place in residuum from cherty limestone and limestone with some local influence from quartzite. Elevations range from 4500 to 6000 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches, the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 degrees F. to 58 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 170 days."
