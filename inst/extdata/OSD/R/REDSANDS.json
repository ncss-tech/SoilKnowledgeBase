Elevations are 3 to 45 meters (10 to 150 feet).  The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2285 millimeters (35 to 90 inches).  The frost-free period is 275 to 325 days."
