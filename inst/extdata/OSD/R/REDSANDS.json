  "OVERVIEW": "The Redsands series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in marine deposits.  Redsands soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1015 millimeters (40 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
