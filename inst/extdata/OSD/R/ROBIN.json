The mollic epipedon is 24 to 32 inches thick. The upper boundary of the argillic horizon is deeper than 24 inches. The solum thickness ranges from 40 inches to 7 feet and is usually greater than 5 feet. The soils are noncalcareous to 5 feet or deeper.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist. It has weak very fine to moderate medium granular structure.  This A horizon is medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay. This horizon has thin and patchy to medium and nearly continuous clay films and continuous ones in the bands. It has weak to moderate, medium to coarse prismatic to moderate, medium to coarse subangular blocky structure. Uncoated or partially uncoated silt specking on the surfaces of peds ranges from thin to medium."

Bozeman soils are calcareous within 40 inches of the surface. Dranyon and Red Spur soils have more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand in the control section.  Huffine and Willow Creek soils have a mollic epipedon thinner than 16 inches. Lanark soils are calcareous within 60 inches of the surface.  Rin soils lack an argillic horizon."
