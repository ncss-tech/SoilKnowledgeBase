The solum thickness ranges from 40 inches to 7 feet and is usually greater than 5 feet. The soils are noncalcareous to 5 feet or deeper.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist. It has weak very fine to moderate medium granular structure.  This A horizon is medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay. This horizon has thin and patchy to medium and nearly continuous clay films and continuous ones in the bands.
