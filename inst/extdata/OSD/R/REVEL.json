Depth to a paralithic contact with sandstone or siltstone and thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are usually moist, but the moisture control section is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of l0.  By weighted average the particle-size control section has 35 to 65 percent weathered pebbles, 0 to l5 percent weathered cobbles, and 0 to l5 percent hard rounded pebbles.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has l5 to 25 percent soft pebbles and 0 to l0 percent hard pebbles.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 3 through 5 moist; 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam.  Some pedons have a Bs horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam."

Bangor, Becket, Berkshire, Chatham, Groveton, Houghtonville, Marlow, Oconto, Rugles, and Welcome soils are more than 40 inches deep.  Dekapen, Mundal and Rixon soils have a paralithic contact with dense glacial till at 20 to 40 inches.  Dixfield and Onota soils have a udic moisture regime and have less than 10 percent weathered sandstone in the particle-size control section.  Michigamme, Rawsonville and Tunbridge soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Revel soils are on mountain backslopes, ridges, and plateaus at elevations of l,200 to 2,200 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium and slope alluvium from sandstone, siltstone, and glacial till.  Revel soils are in a marine climate.  Summers are warm and dry.  Winters are cold and wet with snow cover lasting from December through March.  Average annual precipitation is 45 to 65 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 32 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 61 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is l20 to l50 days."
