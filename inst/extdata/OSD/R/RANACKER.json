Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 4 to 12 inches.  Coarse fragments average 35 percent or more in the series control section.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has color value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is the very flaggy analogues of silty clay loam or silty clay."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap and A horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 9 to 18 inches (Bt horizon) - lithic contact with limestone at 18 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
