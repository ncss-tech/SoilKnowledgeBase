  "OVERVIEW": "The Ranacker series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in residuum from the underlying limestone.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 9 to 14 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 36 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 20 inches and commonly is the same as depth to a lithic contact with limestone.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 4 to 12 inches.  Coarse fragments average 35 percent or more in the series control section.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has color value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is the very flaggy analogues of silty clay loam or silty clay."
