  "OVERVIEW": "The Reno series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Reno soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and fan collars.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
