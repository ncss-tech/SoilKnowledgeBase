  "OVERVIEW": "The Robroost series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium and eolian deposits from gypsiferous sandstone and shale on alluvial fans and plains.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 6 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
