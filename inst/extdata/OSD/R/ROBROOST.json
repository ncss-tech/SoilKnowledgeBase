The soils formed in coarse textured alluvial and eolian deposits from gypsiferous sandstone and shale.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches.  The precipitation is fairly well distributed throughout the year.  There is a slight increase during August, September and October, with the driest months being May and June.  The average frost free period is 145 to 160 days."
