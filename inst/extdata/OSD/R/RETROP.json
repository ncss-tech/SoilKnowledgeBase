    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout the 10- to 40-inch control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, values of 3 or 4 and chromas of 3 or 4.  Where moist color values and chroma are less than 3.5, the thickness is less than 7 inches.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, values of 3 or 4 and chromas that range from 2 through 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam and is stratified with thin strata of coarser and finer material.  Buried horizons occur in some pedons at depths below 24 inches.  Where present, they have hues of 5YR or 7.5YR, values that range from 2 through 4 and chromas of 2 or 3.  Texture of the buried horizon is silty clay loam or silt loam."

Gracemont, Gracemore, and Tribbey soils have water tables comparable to that of Retrop but Gracemont soils have a coarse-loamy control section, Gracemore soils are sandy and Tribbey soils are noncalcareous and have a coarse-loamy control section.  Norwood, Severn, and Yahola soils lack high water tables.  In addition, Severn soils have a coarse-silty control section and Yahola soils have a coarse-loamy control section."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches and occurs mainly in the spring and fall months.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 66 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 38 to 48."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Retrop soils were formerly classified in the Alluvial great soil group and mapped as the land type \"Wet Alluvial Land\".  These soils are associated primarily with soils having Ustic moisture regimes.  However, due to the high water table they are moist or long periods of time, thus for now are considered Udifluvents.  Oklahoma State University tests have indicated that these soils turn gray when treated with dithionate-citrate.  The sediments may be too young to have been gleyed by the high water table.  Studies continue but the present classification reflects the manner in which the soils behave.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
