Kidder soils occupy nearby areas where the thickness of sola over sandy loam glacial till is greater.  McHenry soils occupy similar topography, but have higher silt  and lower sand content in the upper sola.  Miami soils occupy similar topographic positions on contiguous areas where the underlying glacial till is loam, rather than sandy loam."
