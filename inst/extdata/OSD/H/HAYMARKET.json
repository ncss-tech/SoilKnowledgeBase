  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Haymarket Series are very deep, well drained to moderately well drained with moderately slow permeability.  They formed in residuum that weathered from diabase and basalt of the Northern Piedmont uplands.  Slopes range from about 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches and mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

Rock fragments of diabase or basalt gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent in the A, E, and horizon and up to 25 percent in the C horizon.  The soil is very strongly acid through moderately acid in the A, E, and B horizon and moderately acid through neutral in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Lower chroma and value are common in the A or Ap horizons.  The A horizon is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture of the Bt is silty clay loam or clay.  Thin BE and BC horizons, where present, are silt loam through clay.  Black to dark brown concretions and streaks are few to many in the B horizon.\nThe C horizon is commonly multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, green, black and white.  It is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam."
