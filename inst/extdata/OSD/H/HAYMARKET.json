  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 48 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments of diabase or basalt gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent in the A, E, and horizon and up to 25 percent in the C horizon.  The soil is very strongly acid through moderately acid in the A, E, and B horizon and moderately acid through neutral in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Lower chroma and value are common in the A or Ap horizons.  The A horizon is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture of the Bt is silty clay loam or clay.  Thin BE and BC horizons, where present, are silt loam through clay.  Black to dark brown concretions and streaks are few to many in the B horizon.\nThe C horizon is commonly multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, green, black and white.  It is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ainsworth, Brevator, Clinton, Hatton, Lunt, Ursa and Welda series.  The Ainsworth, Clinton, Hatton, Ursa and Welda soils are dominantly formed in loess and do not have rock fragments of diabase or basalt.   Brevator soils formed in local pedisediment and glacial till and have a lithologic discontinuity.  The Lunt soil has rock fragments of rounded quartz."

These soils developed in residuum from intrusives such as diabase and basalt.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F."
