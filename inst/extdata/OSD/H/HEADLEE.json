  "OVERVIEW": "The Headlee series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy, water-sorted material and the underlying lacustrine materials on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
