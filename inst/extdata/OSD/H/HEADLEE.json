Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days.

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper loamy material and moderately low or low in the lacustrine materials. Permeability is moderate in the upper loamy material and slow or very slow in the lacustrine materials."

Transect data for the typical pedon (T97IN-131-187) is on file in MLRA project office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect in a Headlee-Brady complex map unit shows 80 percent Headlee and similar soils, and 20 percent Strole soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
