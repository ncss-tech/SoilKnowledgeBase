  "OVERVIEW": "The Hawkinspeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Hawkinspeak soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

Bickmore soils have Btk horizons with 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Bluebell soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section.  Buena Vista soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.  Dailybasin soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Littlemud soils have mollic epipedons that do not include the argillic horizon and have rock fragments which are quartzite or rhyolite.  Sweetmount soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 27 to 50 percent clay.  Rutherford soils have mean summer soil temperature of 55 to 59 degrees F.  Woodhurst soils have an ustic moisture regime and mean summer soil temperature of 55 to 59 degrees F."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.   Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 10,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 50 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 33 inches (A1, A2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 9 to 33 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 33 inches to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 9 to 29 inches (Bt1 horizon and part of the Bt2 horizon).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic Pachic Argicryolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class."
