  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 7 to 19 inches thick. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The argillic horizon is more than 6 inches thick and its lower boundary extends below 10 inches. Usually these soils are noncalcareous throughout but are inconsistently calcareous just above the bedrock in some pedons. Organic carbon content of the mollic epipedon ranges from .6 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth. Coarse fragments usually are less than 10 percent in the solum and C horizon but in some pedons ranges to 35 percent cobbles and pebbles in the upper part of the profile. Mean annual soils temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It usually has granular structure but it has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft to slightly hard. It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. It usually has prismatic structure but it has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is typically sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent, and sand from 40 to 75 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline. The higher reactions are due to discontinuous carbonates immediately above the bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hargreave soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping uplands. Slopes typically range from 0 to about 15 percent. These soils formed in noncalcareous materials weathered residually from soft, noncalcareous sandstone. Elevations are 3,500 to 5,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 19 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. Mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. Frost-free season ranges from 105 to 130 days."
