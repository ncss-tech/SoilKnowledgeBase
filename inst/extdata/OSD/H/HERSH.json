  "OVERVIEW": "The Hersh series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in mixed eolian sandy and loamy material.  These soils are on uplands and stream terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 56 centimeters do not have redoximorphic features 56 centimeters (22 inches), and mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.) at the type location.",
