Beach soils are have drier soil moisture control sections in the winter.  Akela soils are usually dry from October through May and formed on basalt.  Chatticiup soils contain less than 15 percent calcium carbonate in the BK horizon and are moist less than 20 days cumulative in summer.  Tecopa and Upspring soils are dry from June to November.  Hulda soils contain more than 30 percent medium, coarse and very coarse sand.  Haleburu and Razorback soils are moist less than 20 days cumulative in the summer months."
