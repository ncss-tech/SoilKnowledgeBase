  "OVERVIEW": "The Hindu series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils on hills and mesas.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

Beach soils are have drier soil moisture control sections in the winter.  Akela soils are usually dry from October through May and formed on basalt.  Chatticiup soils contain less than 15 percent calcium carbonate in the BK horizon and are moist less than 20 days cumulative in summer.  Tecopa and Upspring soils are dry from June to November.  Hulda soils contain more than 30 percent medium, coarse and very coarse sand.  Haleburu and Razorback soils are moist less than 20 days cumulative in the summer months."
