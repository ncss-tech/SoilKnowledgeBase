  "OVERVIEW": "The Hepler series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvial sediments.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on flood plains in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112) and Ozark Highlands (MLRA 116A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (58 degrees F).",

Mason soils contain a mollic epipedon, well to moderately well drained, rarely flooded, and occur on higher floodplain steps on river valleys.  Osage soils have a mollic epipedon, are fine textured, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on similar landscape positions.  Parsons soils have a fine  particle size control section and occur on uplands of plains.  Radley soils have a mollic epipedon, do not have an argillic horizon, moderately well drained, and occur on floodplain steps of river valleys.  Verdigris soils: have a mollic epipedon, do not have an argillic horizon, well drained, and occur on similar landscape positions.   Wynona soils have a mollic epipedon, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on floodplain steps on river valleys.  McCune soils have a glossic horizon and occur on low terraces on plains."
