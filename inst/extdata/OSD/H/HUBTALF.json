  "OVERVIEW": "The Hubtalf series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and alluvium from mixed sources. Hubtalf soils are on low terraces and floodplains. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
