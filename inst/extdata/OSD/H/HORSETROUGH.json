  "OVERVIEW": "The Horsetrough series consists of deep and very deep, poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils along drainageways in coves at high elevations in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B). They formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from metasedimentary parent material. Slope range is  2 to 30 percent.",

Slopes are between 2 and 30 percent. Elevation ranges from about 4500 to 6400 feet. These soils formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as metasandstone, phyllite and slate. Mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 60 to 100 inches. Moist atmospheric conditions are prevalent and fog is common in these high mountain areas."

Common trees are northern red oak, black birch, American beech, yellow birch, black cherry, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, yellow buckeye, red spruce, and fraser fir. In many areas the trees are stunted due to wind and ice damage and a \"windswept phase\" is recognized. The understory species are serviceberry, striped maple, American chestnut sprouts, red maple, pin cherry, rhododendron, mountain-laurel, silverbell, blueberry, and flame azalea. Common forbs are hay-scented fern, wood fern, New York fern, Solomon's seal, yellow mandarin, and trillium."

Drainageways in coves that Horsetrough soils occupy are normally too narrow to delineate as a consociation map unit. However, these areas represent unique habitat for certain aquatic species.\nRevisions made 9/07(HCD) adjusted OSD to reflect Lab Data.\nThe Horsetrough series has the following diagnostic horizons and features:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 13 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nParalithic contact - weathered bedrock contact at 46 inches (upper boundary of the 2Cr horizon).\nIsotic mineralogy class - In more than one-half of the control section, a 1500 kPa water to clay ratio of 0.6 or more and a pH in NaF solution of more than 8.4.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data from NSSC-SSL sample S00NC-087-004.\nNASIS Site ID: 114006\nNASIS Pedon ID: 114880\nNASIS User Pedon ID: Horsetrough OSD\nNASIS DMU ID: 411076\nMLRA = 130\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
