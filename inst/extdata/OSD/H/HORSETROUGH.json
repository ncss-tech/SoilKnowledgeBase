Content of mica flakes is few or common throughout. Rock fragment content averages 35 to 80 percent in the particle-size control section, and less than 60 percent in underlying horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some subhorizons may have a texture of fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon is multicolored or has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some subhorizons may have a texture of fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe 2Cr horizon is weathered metasedimentary bedrock such as metasandstone, phyllite, or slate. It is partly consolidated but can be dug with difficulty with a spade."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Horsetrough soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep slopes along drainageways in coves at high elevations in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). Slopes are between 2 and 30 percent. Elevation ranges from about 4500 to 6400 feet. These soils formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as metasandstone, phyllite and slate. Mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 60 to 100 inches. Moist atmospheric conditions are prevalent and fog is common in these high mountain areas."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of this soil is in forest. Common trees are northern red oak, black birch, American beech, yellow birch, black cherry, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, yellow buckeye, red spruce, and fraser fir. In many areas the trees are stunted due to wind and ice damage and a \"windswept phase\" is recognized. The understory species are serviceberry, striped maple, American chestnut sprouts, red maple, pin cherry, rhododendron, mountain-laurel, silverbell, blueberry, and flame azalea. Common forbs are hay-scented fern, wood fern, New York fern, Solomon's seal, yellow mandarin, and trillium."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Horsetrough soils are mapped in complex with Chiltoskie and Heintooga soils. Drainageways in coves that Horsetrough soils occupy are normally too narrow to delineate as a consociation map unit. However, these areas represent unique habitat for certain aquatic species.\nRevisions made 9/07(HCD) adjusted OSD to reflect Lab Data.\nThe Horsetrough series has the following diagnostic horizons and features:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 13 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nParalithic contact - weathered bedrock contact at 46 inches (upper boundary of the 2Cr horizon).\nIsotic mineralogy class - In more than one-half of the control section, a 1500 kPa water to clay ratio of 0.6 or more and a pH in NaF solution of more than 8.4.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data from NSSC-SSL sample S00NC-087-004.\nNASIS Site ID: 114006\nNASIS Pedon ID: 114880\nNASIS User Pedon ID: Horsetrough OSD\nNASIS DMU ID: 411076\nMLRA = 130\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
