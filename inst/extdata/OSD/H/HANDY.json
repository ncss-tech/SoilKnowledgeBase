  "OVERVIEW": "The Handy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from igneous rocks with some influence from limestone and dolostone.  Handy soils are on fan remnants and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from igneous rocks but are influenced some by limestone and dolostone.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 2,170 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Overland soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have calcic horizons and carbonatic mineralogy."

There is a strongly contrasting particle-size class due to the major lithologic discontinuity at 76 cm.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 20 cm (A and BA horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 20 to 76 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 33 to 152 cm (Btk and 2Bk horizons).\nMajor lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to loamy material at 76 cm (2Bk horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 20 to 100 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons and part of the 2Bk horizon)."
