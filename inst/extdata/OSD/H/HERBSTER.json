  "OVERVIEW": "The Herbster series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on till plains. They formed in clayey glacial till and/or clayey lacustrine deposits modified by wave action and in the underlying loamy and/or sandy stratified lacustrine deposits. They are on till plains and/or lake plains. Permeability is slow in the clayey till and moderate to rapid in the stratified lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the clayey till, and depth to the stratified substratum all range from 40 to 60 inches. The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout. Redoximorphic features, saturation, aquic conditions and a positive reaction with alpha-alpha dipyridyl occur at the top of the argillic at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value and chroma of 2 or 3. Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nHerbster soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both).\nThe E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR; value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically clay, but in some pedons it is clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, and value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon. It is 2.5YR or 5YR; value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The lower part is stratified. Individual strata are clay, silty clay or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically stratified clay and silty clay loam, but some pedons have subhorizons with stratifications of silty clay. Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nIn some areas stratifications are absent in the Bt and/or Btk horizons.\nThe 2C or 3C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR and 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is stratified. Individual strata are mostly silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, very fine sand, or fine sand, but a few thin strata of finer texture are in many pedons. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2Ck horizon with colors and textures similar to those of the 2C horizon."

Allendale soils have 20 to 40 inches of sandy outwash above the clay. The somewhat poorly drained Badriver and moderately well drained Sanborg soils occur on similar landscapes and have greater than 60 inches of clay. The moderately well drained Eaglebay soils have 10 to 24 inches of loamy outwash above the clayey till. Frogbay soils are on similar landscapes and have loamy till at 15 to 36 inches below the clay. The moderately well drained Morganlake soils have 20 to 40 inches of sandy outwash over loamy till and occur on adjacent higher landscape positions. The well drained Cornucopia, moderately well drained Portwing are in a drainage sequence with Herbster soils."

Permeability is slow in the clayey till and/or clayey lacustrine deposits and moderate to rapid in the stratified substratum. Herbster soils have a perched seasonal water table above the clayey till at a depth of 0.5 to 1.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period September to June in 6 or more out of 10 years. Herbster soils also have an apparent water table below 40 inches in the stratified substratum at some time during the same time period in normal years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested. Some areas are used for cropland or pastureland. Oats, bromegrass, timothy, alfalfa, trefoil, and red clover are the principal crops. Many areas which were formerly cropland are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. Common trees are red maple, balsam fir, white spruce, eastern white pine, quaking aspen, paper birch and bur oak. Common understory plants are American hazelnut, redosier dogwood, black snakeroot, big-leaved aster, wild sarsaparilla and bracken fern."

Water table studies in this soil (and it's associated soils) were used to classify this series.\nOnly series status, responsibility, and scrivener's errors changed - 3/09."
