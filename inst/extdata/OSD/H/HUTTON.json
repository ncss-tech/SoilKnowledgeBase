The soil formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual air temperature is about 41 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 50 to 90 days."

Bruneel soils are in a coarse loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal family.  Carey Lake soils are well drained and are in a fine-loamy family.  Little Wood soils are well drained and are in a loamy-skeletal family.  Marshdale soils are poorly drained and are in a fine-loamy family.  Bringmee, Carey Lake, and Little Wood soils are on fan terraces and stream terraces.  Bruneel and Marshdale are on similar landscapes to the Hutton series."
