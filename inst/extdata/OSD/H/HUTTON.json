  "OVERVIEW": "The Hutton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Hutton soils are on floodplains, stream terraces, and depressions and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
