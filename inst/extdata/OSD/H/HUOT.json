The calcic horizon is at depths of less than 16 inches.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  The content of rock fragments by volume commonly ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper sediments, and from 0 to 10 percent in the underlying clayey material.  Some pedons have a gravelly or cobbly layer at the base of the upper sediment.\nThe Ap and Ak horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2. The texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or loamy sand.  The clay content ranges from 5 to 15 percent and the sand content ranges from 65 to 85 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or less.

The poorly drained Clearwater soils are in lower lying swales and broad level areas and do not have the sandy upper mantle.  The poorly drained Espelie and Thiefriver soils are typically in lower lying concave swales.  The somewhat poorly and moderately well drained Grimstad soils are in similar landscape positions but do not have the clayey underlying material.  The moderately well and somewhat poorly drained Hilaire soils are on similar landscape positions and do not have a calcic horizon.  The somewhat poorly and moderately well drained Ulen soils are on similar landscape positions but do not have clayey underlying material. The somewhat poorly drained Wheatville soils are on similar landscape positions but have a coarse-silty upper mantle."
