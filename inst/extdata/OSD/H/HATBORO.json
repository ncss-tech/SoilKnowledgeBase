Organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth or is greater than 0.2 percent directly above any strongly contrasting C horizon. The depth to strongly contrasting sand and gravel is more than 40 inches or the transition is greater than 5 inches. Content of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and from 0 to 80 percent in the C horizon. Mica flakes are common in the solum, and the C horizon contains thin lenses of mica. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral to a depth of 30 inches and from moderately acid through slightly acid below 30 inches. Depth to low chroma redox depletions is 0 to 10 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is sandy loam, loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 through 7. Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Structure is weak, fine or medium subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 4 through 7. Fine-earth texture is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sand in the upper part and contains thin lenses of primarily mica flakes. The lower part is stratified sand, silt and clay sediments and gravel."

Airy and Rowland soils are on the uplands nearby. Brandywine, Chester, Comus, Glenelg, Manor and Mt. Airy are all well drained soils. Baile soils have an argillic horizon. Glenville soils are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained and have a fragipan. Holly soils have sola that do not contain appreciable mica and that range between 20 to 44 inches thick.  The Rowland series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvial sediments weathered from red and brown shale, sandstone, and conglomerate."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Hatboro soils were formerly included with the Wehadkee series.\nThe 2/99 revision places this soil in an active CEC activity class based on similar soils. The 7/2001 revision changes the classification from Typic\nFluvaquents to Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts to reflect changes to cambic horizon criteria in Soil Taxonomy. Competing series were also updated. The 5/2003 revision expands the solum thickness from 40 to 60 inches to 30 to 60 inches to facilitate correlation activities in the MO14 region. The 9/2005 revision adds fine sandy loam to the RIC of the A, B and C horizons and changes horizon nomenclature. Competing series was also updated. Revision 1/2006 JHK-DHK: Pedon Description and type location updated. Revision 9/2008 Description and type location as well as competing and geographically associated soils updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 44 inches (Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).\nMLRA=130, 136, 148, 149A"
