  "OVERVIEW": "The Hogan series consists of shallow to moderately deep over permafrost, well drained soils that formed in stratified loamy alluvium.  Hogan soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

Reaction throughout the profile ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe AC/O and C/O are separated into their respective parts;  the AC or C part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist of 2, 3, or 4; chroma moist of 1 through 3.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  The O part has value moist of 2 or 3; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is muck or mucky peat.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 1 through 3.  Texture is stratified fine sand through silt with composite texture of fine sandy loam or sandy loam; occasional pockets and strata of organic materials occur and have texture of muck or mucky peat.  Few to common redoximorphic features occur in some pedons; when present, redox concentrations have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; chroma moist of 4 or 6; redox depletions have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; chroma moist of 1 or 2."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic features recognized in this profile include: assumed irregular decrease in organic carbon based on colors and stratification; pergelic temperature regime; coarse loamy particle size (weighted average) from 0 to 25 inches and permafrost at 25 inches.  These soils are exposed to rare flooding, exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon and have permafrost within 1 meter.  Formerly classified as loamy, mixed, nonacid Pergelic Cryorthents."
