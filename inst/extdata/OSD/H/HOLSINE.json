  "OVERVIEW": "The Holsine series consists of very deep, well drained soils on eroded fan remnants and pediment remnants.  They formed in alluvium derived from limestone and welded tuff and mixed lacustrine deposits.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
