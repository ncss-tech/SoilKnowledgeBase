    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Holsine soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of eroded fan remnants and pediment remnants. They formed in alluvium derived from tuff and limestone over mixed lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,350 to 2,000 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with a mean annual temperature of 7 to 10 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm. The frost-free period is about 90 to 110 days."
