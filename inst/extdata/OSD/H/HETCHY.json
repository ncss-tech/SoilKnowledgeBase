  "OVERVIEW": "The Hetchy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. The Hetchy soils are on hills and ridges. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
