  "OVERVIEW": "The Hibbing series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess and underlying fine, dense till on till plains and moraines. Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow. Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",

Moderately well drained Majestic soils have a coarse-textured mantle 20 to 40 inches thick.
