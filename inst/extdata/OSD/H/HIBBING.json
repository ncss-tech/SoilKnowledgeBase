  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hibbing soils are on convex or linear surfaces of till plains and moraines. Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent. They formed in a thin mantle of loess and underlying fine, dense glacial till deposited by the St. Louis sublobe of late Wisconsin age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 41 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 28 inches. The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days. Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1600 feet."

Somewhat poorly drained Buhl, poorly drained McQuade and very poorly drained Fayal soils form a hydrosequence with Hibbing soils. Moderately well drained Majestic soils have a coarse-textured mantle 20 to 40 inches thick. Very poorly drained Daisybay and Dora soils are on broad flats and in depressions and formed in organic materials over till. Very poorly drained Rifle soils are in depressions and formed in organic materials."
