  "STATES": "MD,NJ,PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Howell series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in fine unconsolidated sediments containing detectable amounts of diatomaceous earth and/or glauconite.  They are nearly level to steep soils on uplands in the northern part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain.  They typically have a dark yellowish brown fine sandy loam Ap horizon and strong brown and pale olive heavy clay loam and clay B2 horizons over a massive pale olive clay C horizon.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Unlimed pedons are very strongly acid or extremely acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6; value of 3 is in only the very thin A horizon in undisturbed pedons.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam except in severely eroded pedons it is commonly clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR in the upper part and 2.5Y or 5Y in the lower part.  It has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 to 8; chroma less than 6 confined is in only the lower part.  High chroma mottling is evident in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  It is heavy silty clay loam, clay, silty clay or heavy clay loam with less than 40 percent sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  High chroma mottling may be present.  It is clay or silty clay except in some pedons there is a 2C horizon that is sandy clay loam or clay loam and contains up to 40 percent fine smooth pebbles."

All of these series have hue of 10YR or redder throughout the B horizon except for Monmouth soils.  Mormouth soils have weighted average of more than 40 percent sand in the B horizon.  The Albertville, Baxter, Christian, Culpepper, Durmore, Elioak, Enders, Fluibanna, Hayesville, Kirvin, Luverne, Nason, Shubuta, Tatum, Townley, and Vance soils are in related families.  Albertville, Enders, Fluvanna, Kirvin, Luverne, Nason, Tatum, Townley and Vance soils have mean annual soil temperature greater than 59 degrees F.  Baxter, Dunmore, and Shubuta soils have sola more than 60 inches in thickness.  Christian, Culpepper and Elioak soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Hayesville soils have oxidic mineralogy."
