  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from about 20 to 55 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Content of rock fragments is normally less than 10 percent in the upper 40 inches but ranges from 0 to 15 percent and 0 to 50 percent below 40 inches. The reaction ranges from neutral to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, silt loam or rarely fine sandy loam. Some pedons have a few mottles in shades of brown.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Mottles in shades of brown or yellow are usually present. Chroma of 2 is also allowed below a depth of 20 inches. Mottles of chroma 2 or less are within 24 inches of the surface. It is dominantly silt loam or loam but includes clay loam, silty clay loam and thin horizons of fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 0 to 6 or is mottled in shades of brown, gray and red without a dominant color. Texture is the same as the Bw horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Marietta is the only series in the same family. Marietta soils formed in mixed Coastal Plain and Blackland Prairie sediments. They are void of coarse fragments and typically have a higher sand content. Soils in closely related families are the Chagrin, Hontas, Lindell, Lindside, Lobdell, Monacan, Ocana, Senecaville, Sensabaugh, Sullivan, Tuckahoe and Weaver series. All of these series except Lindell, Monacan, Ocana, Sullivan and Tuckahoe have mixed mineralogy and mesic temperature. Lindell soils have mixed mineralogy. Monacan soils formed in sediments from metamorphic and igneous rocks and have mixed mineralogy. Ocana soils are well drained, have mixed mineralogy and more than 15 percent rock fragments throughout. Sullivan soils are well drained and have no mottles of chroma 2 or less within the upper 24 inches. Tuckahoe are well drained soils that formed in sediments from metamorphic and igneous rocks and have mixed mineralogy."
