  "OVERVIEW": "The Hawi series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed from weathered basic volcanic ash and residuum from basalt.  Hawi soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is 760 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).",

These soils are on all hillslope positions of nearly level to strongly sloping lava flows that are 250,000 to 750,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed from weathered basic volcanic ash and residuum from basalt. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 640 to 1020 millimeters (25 to 40 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2,286 to 2,540 meters (90 to 100 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C (70 to 76 degrees F) average January temperature is 21 degrees (69 degrees F); average July temperature is 24 degrees (75 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
