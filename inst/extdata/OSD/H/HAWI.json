  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hawi soils are on low elevation, windward slopes of Kohala Mountain at elevations from sea level to 610 meters (0 to 2000 feet). These soils are on all hillslope positions of nearly level to strongly sloping lava flows that are 250,000 to 750,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed from weathered basic volcanic ash and residuum from basalt. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 640 to 1020 millimeters (25 to 40 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2,286 to 2,540 meters (90 to 100 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C (70 to 76 degrees F) average January temperature is 21 degrees (69 degrees F); average July temperature is 24 degrees (75 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
