Chinwhisker soils have glossic E/Bt horizons within 40 inches.  Eauclaire soils have a Bt horizon below the spodic horizon.  Croswell, Croswood, Cublake, Gilchrist, and Halfaday soils do not have textures of sandy loam or fine sandy loam within the upper 15 inches of the series control section and contain less than 15 percent  rock fragments in the C horizon.  Manitowish soils do not contain free carbonates within a depth of 60 inches.  Mattix soils are saturated within a zone from 0.5 to 1.5 feet at some time during the period from October to May."
