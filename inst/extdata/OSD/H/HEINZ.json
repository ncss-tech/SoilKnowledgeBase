  "OVERVIEW": "The Heinz series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial deposits and in the underlying glacial outwash on outwash plains and ground moraines.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy part and very rapid in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Chinwhisker soils have glossic E/Bt horizons within 40 inches.  Eauclaire soils have a Bt horizon below the spodic horizon.  Croswell, Croswood, Cublake, Gilchrist, and Halfaday soils do not have textures of sandy loam or fine sandy loam within the upper 15 inches of the series control section and contain less than 15 percent  rock fragments in the C horizon.  Manitowish soils do not contain free carbonates within a depth of 60 inches.  Mattix soils are saturated within a zone from 0.5 to 1.5 feet at some time during the period from October to May."
