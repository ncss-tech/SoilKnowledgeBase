  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Akela (NM), Beach (TX)(T), Dalvord (CA), Galehills (NV)(T), Haleburu (CA), Hindu (AZ), Noble Pass (CA), Paintrocks (CA), Tecopa (CA), Terlingua (TX), and Upspring (CA) series. Potential competitors that do not yet have CEA class assigned are the, Pearce and Razorback series.  Akela, Beach, Hindu, and Terlingua soils are moist for more than 20 days cumulative in the summer months.  In addition, the Akela soils are dominated by fine sand, the Beach soils have hue redder than 7.5YR and are dominated by fine sand, the Hindu soils have less than 30 percent medium sand or coarser, formed in limestone, and have 20 to 35 percent calcium carbonate, the Terlingua soils are less than 14 inches deep to paralithic materials.  Dalvord, Galehills, Haleburu, Noble Pass, Paintrocks, Tecopa and Upspring soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods due to a much lower rainfall component.  In addition, the Galehills soils formed in sandstone conglomerate, the Noble Pass soils have more than 60 percent coarse fragments, the Paintrocks soils are less than 3 inches deep to paralithic materials, and the Upspring soils formed in material influenced by pyroclastics.  The Pearce soils formed in limestone and are dominated by cobble and stone.  The Razorback soils have less than 30 percent medium sand or coarser and formed in basalt and similar volcanic rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hulda soils are on hills and mountains at elevations of 2,500 to 5,200 feet.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Slopes range from 20 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 280 days."
