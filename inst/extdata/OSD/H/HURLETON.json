Gopheridge soils have metavolcanic rock fragments throughout, and typically have heavier textures (>35 percent clay) with redder hues (2.5YR, 5YR) in the lower argillic horizon. Hetchy and Oroshore both have a paralithic contact of metasedimentary rock between 50 and 100 cm and Hetchy has lithic material of metasedimentary rock within 25 cm of the paralithic contact."
