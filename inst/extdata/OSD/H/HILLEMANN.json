Calhoun and Henry soils occur on similar landscapes; are poorly drained and do not have a natric horizon.  Calloway soils occur on slightly higher positions; have a fragipan and do not have a natric horizon.  Grenada and Loring soils occurs on adjacent loess covered uplands, or on dissected areas along the terrace escarpment; are moderately well drained, contain a fragipan and do not have a natric horizon.  Grubbs soils occur on terrace escarpments and perimeter of terrace treads; are moderately well drained, in a fine particle-size class and do not contain a natric horizon.  Tichnor soils occur on drains; are poorly drained and do not contain a natric horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is slow to medium.  Permeability is very slow due to the high concentration of sodium which causes dispersion of the clay in the subsoil.  These soils have a seasonally high water table 1 to 2 feet below the soil surface from December through April most years."
