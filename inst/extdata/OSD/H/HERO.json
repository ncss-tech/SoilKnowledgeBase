  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 36 inches and typically corresponds to the depth of the sandy and gravelly substratum.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent in the solum and from 15 to 65 percent in the substratum.  Typically, 75 percent or more of the rock fragments are rounded pebbles.  The soil is moderately acid to neutral in the A horizon, moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the B horizon and neutral to moderately alkaline in the 2C horizon. Carbonates are within a depth of 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The A or Ap horizon is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Subhorizons with chroma of 2 are below a depth of 20 inches.  The Bw horizon has iron depletions above a depth of 24 inches.  It is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam with less than 50 percent fine and coarser sand, except some pedons have a sandy loam subhorizon less than 5 inches thick just above the 2C horizon.  The Bw horizon has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure or it is massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand in the fine earth.  Rock fragments in individual layers range from 5 to 65 percent, but the weighted average is more than 15 percent."

Amenia, Georgia and Hogansburg soils have a loamy glacial till substratum.  Belgrade soils lack carbonates within 40 inches and are coarse-silty.  Copake soils lack iron depletions within a 24 inch depth.  Dover, Grenville, Lenox, Nellis, Pittsfield and Stockbridge soils lack iron depletions and have a loamy glacial till substratum.  Ellington and Ninigret soils lack carbonates.  Galway soils lack redoximorphic features and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Minoa soils are coarse-loamy and have less than 5 percent rock fragments.  Pawling soils are on floodplains and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hero soils are nearly level and gently sloping soils on glaciofluvial landforms.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in loamy over stratified sandy and gravelly glacial outwash derived mainly from limestone, shale, schist, sandstone and dolomite.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 50 inches and the growing season is 120 to 180 days."

The excessively drained Groton, well drained Copake, Hazen and Palmyra soils, somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained Fredon and very poorly drained Halsey soils are drainage associates on terraces.  Hadley and Winooski soils are on floodplains.  Dover, Lenox, Nellis, Pittsfield, and Stockbridge soils are located on nearby glacial till uplands.
