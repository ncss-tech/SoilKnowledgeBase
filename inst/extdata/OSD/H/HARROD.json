  "OVERVIEW": "The Harrod series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick overlying limestone or dolostone. These soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 135 to 180 days.
