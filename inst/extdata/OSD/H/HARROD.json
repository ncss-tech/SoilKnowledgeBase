  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Harrod soils are on narrow flood plains along streams in areas of Wisconsin glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy alluvium overlying limestone or dolostone. The source of the alluvium is calcareous, loamy drift of Wisconsin age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 135 to 180 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."
