  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 40 to more than 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral. Content of mica flakes is none to common in the A, AB, BA, and Btg horizons, and ranges from few to many in the lower horizons. Content of rock fragments is less than 15 percent in the A, Btg, and BCg horizons. In the Cg horizon, rock fragment content may range from 0 up to 60 percent as thin strata. Fragments are gravel and cobble size.\nThe Ap or A horizon is neutral, or has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3. Pedons in which the A horizon is 10 inches thick or less, have an AB or BA horizon that is part of the umbric epipedon. The Ap or A horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has the same color range as the Ap or A horizon, and is silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. Combined thickness of the Ap, A, BA, and AB horizons in an individual pedon is 10 to 20 inches.\nThe Btg horizon typically is neutral, or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. In some pedons, the Btg horizon has hue of 5GY, 5G, 5BG, or 5B, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1. Redoximorphic features include masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive and iron depletions are in shades of gray, yellow, olive, or brown. It is silty clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay.\nThe BCg or CBg horizon, where present, typically is neutral, or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. In some pedons, it has hue of 5GY, 5G, 5BG, or 5B, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1. Redoximorphic features include masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive and iron depletions are in shades of gray, yellow, olive, or brown.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.\nThe Cg horizon is similar in color to the BCg horizon. Redoximorphic features include masses of iron accumulation  in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive and iron depletions are in shades of gray, yellow, olive, or brown.  It is variable in texture and ranges from sand to clay loam in the fine-earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hemphill soils are on nearly level, low stream terraces in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B). Flooding is rare. These soils formed in alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from about 1,300 to 2,800 feet. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Braddock, Rosman, Statler, and Unison soils. The Braddock, Unison, and Statler soils are well drained and are on higher lying stream terraces. Rosman soils are well drained and are in flood plains adjacent to the stream terraces."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained; saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately slow to slow; slow permeability. Index surface runoff is low or medium. Seasonal high water table is at a depth of 0.0 to 1.0 feet in winter and early spring and 0.5 to 1.5 feet summer and fall. These soils receive surface and subsurface water from surrounding uplands."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of this soil is cleared and is used mainly for pasture or hay, or it is idle. Some areas have been drained and are used for corn, tomatoes, and burley tobacco. Native vegetation in forested areas includes yellow-poplar, eastern white pine, red maple, and eastern hemlock."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Hemphill series was formerly included with the Kinkora series. However, Kinkora soils have an ochric epipedon and are Typic Endoaquults\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - 0 to 13 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - 13 to 38 inches (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nCharacterization data are available from the NSSC Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for the following pedons:   86NC-087-004 and  86NC-099-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
