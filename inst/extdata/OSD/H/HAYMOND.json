  "OVERVIEW": "The Haymond series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in silty alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches).",
