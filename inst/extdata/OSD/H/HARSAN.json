Ackelton soils have less than 20 percent clay in the Bkq horizon.  Colbar, Eusbio, and Sidlake soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Blacknest soils are moderately deep to sand and gravel.  Esha, Greenbrae, Hoosegow, Lankbush, Morfitt, and Turria soils lack Bk horizons.  Paulville soils lack a duripan at 40 to 60 inches, and have Bk horizons with less than 15 percent clay.
