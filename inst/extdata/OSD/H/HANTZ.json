  "OVERVIEW": "The Hantz series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified mixed alluvium.  Hantz soils are on flood plains, stream terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
