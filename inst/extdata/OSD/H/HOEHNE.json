  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoehne series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  Hoehne soils are on terraces and flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
