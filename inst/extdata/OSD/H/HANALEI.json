  "OVERVIEW": "The Hanalei series consists of somewhat poorly drained to poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basic igneous rock.  Hanalei soils are on bottom lands and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 2032 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C.
