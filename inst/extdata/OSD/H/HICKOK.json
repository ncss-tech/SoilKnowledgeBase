  "OVERVIEW": "The Hickok series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and local alluvium derived from sandstone.  Hickok soils are on summits and backslopes of ridges and bedrock-controlled terraces and hillslopes in mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
