  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Henshaw, Higdon, Lykens, Ogontz, Sardinia, and Travilah series. Henshaw soils are less than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and formed in alluvium derived from calcareous loess. Higdon soils formed in colluvium and alluvium, typically have rock fragments in the series control section and are neutral or more acid throughout the soil profile. Lykens soils are less than 127 cm (50 inches) to carbonates, have rock fragments and formed in till in the lower part of the series control section. Ogontz soils have carbonates within a depth of 122 centimeters (48 inches) and formed in glaciolacustrine deposits. Sardinia soils have brittle horizons, rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and formed in outwash or old alluvium. Travilah soils have a lithic contact at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) and formed in residuum weathered from serpentine."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hartz soils are on flats of loess-covered lake plains. They formed in 114 to 178 cm (45 to 70 inches) of loess and the underlying lacustrine sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost-free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 110 to 150 meters (360 to 495 feet) above mean sea level."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (1.41 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and moderately low or moderately high (0.42 to 4.23 micrometers/sec) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow (0.2 to 2.0 inches per hour) in the upper part of the solum and slow or moderately slow (0.06 to 0.6 inches per hour) in the lower part. The potential for surface water runoff is low."
