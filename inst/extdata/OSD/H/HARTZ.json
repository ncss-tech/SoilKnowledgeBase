  "OVERVIEW": "The Hartz series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on loess-covered lake plains. They formed in loess and the underlying stratified lacustrine sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

Henshaw soils are less than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and formed in alluvium derived from calcareous loess. Higdon soils formed in colluvium and alluvium, typically have rock fragments in the series control section and are neutral or more acid throughout the soil profile. Lykens soils are less than 127 cm (50 inches) to carbonates, have rock fragments and formed in till in the lower part of the series control section. Ogontz soils have carbonates within a depth of 122 centimeters (48 inches) and formed in glaciolacustrine deposits. Sardinia soils have brittle horizons, rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and formed in outwash or old alluvium. Travilah soils have a lithic contact at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) and formed in residuum weathered from serpentine."
