  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is less than 30 inches, but ranges from 7 to 45 inches.  Depth to carbonates range from 12 to 40 inches.  The A, E and upper Btn horizons are free of carbonates.  Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 3 inches thick.  Total thickness of A and E horizons ranges from 1 to 4 inches. Visible salts are in the Bg and Cg horizons of some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 5 moist and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or clay averaging 45 to 60 percent clay.  It is slightly acid to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btkn, Btnz or Btny horizon.\nThe Bg and Byg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are silty clay, clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bk, Bky, Bkz, Bkzg or Bz horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It has textures similar to the Bg and Byg horizons.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Soft bedrock or loam or clay loam till is below depths of 40 inches in some pedons. Some pedons have 1 to 5 percent gravel in the C horizon."

Ryan soils have carbonates within depths of 10 inches and are on terraces and glacial lake plains. Harriet soils have carbonates within depths of 11 inches and formed in stratified alluvium.  Ranslo soils have a combined A and E horizon thickness of 5 inches or more."

Harriet soils are on floodplains and low terraces.  Dimmick and McKenzie soils are in the same basins adjacent to the Heil soils.  These soils do not have natric horizons.  In addition, McKenzie soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Amor, Cabba, Morton, Reeder, Regent, Sen, Williams and Zahl soils are on higher positions on the landscape.  They are well drained soils and do not have natric horizons."
