The A, E and upper Btn horizons are free of carbonates.  Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 3 inches thick.  Total thickness of A and E horizons ranges from 1 to 4 inches. Visible salts are in the Bg and Cg horizons of some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 5 moist and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or clay averaging 45 to 60 percent clay.  It is slightly acid to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btkn, Btnz or Btny horizon.\nThe Bg and Byg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are silty clay, clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.
