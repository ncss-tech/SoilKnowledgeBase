  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Haugen series consists of moderately well drained soils that are very deep to a densic contact.  These soils formed in sandy loam till or mudflow sediments on end moraines and disintegration moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow in the lower part of the solum, and very slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to densic contact range from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section averages from 6 to 17 percent clay and from 55 to 80 percent fine sand or coarser. The base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 60 percent in some part of the argillic horizon. Rock fragments are of mixed lithology and primarily of igneous origin and include no limestone or dolomite fragments. Volume of gravel ranges from 1 to 15 percent in the surface layer and from 5 to 35 percent in the subsoil and substratum. Volume of cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent and volume of stones range from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.  Redox concentrations are within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bw horizon with spodic colors have pH of 6.0 or greater or have less than 0.6 percent organic.\nHaugen soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors with moist chroma of 3 have moist value of 6 or more or dry value of 7 or more. Texture typically is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs, but in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has color like the Bt part described above.  Texture is dominantly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.6 to 1.85 g/cm3. Some pedons have pockets, strata, or subhorizons of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a BCd horizon with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 g/cm3.

Amery soils are on more sloping or higher positions on the landscape.  Glendenning soils are on footslopes, toe slopes, or lower less sloping areas. Capitola soils are in depressions or drainageways.\nThe well drained Santiago soils, the moderately well drained Freeon soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Magnor soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is a silty mantle 12 to 36 inches thick."
