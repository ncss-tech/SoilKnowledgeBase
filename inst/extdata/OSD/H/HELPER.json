(Bw, Bk horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 10 cm.  (A horizon)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 10 to 89 cm.  (Bw and Bk horizons)\nSecondary carbonates:  The zone from 38 to 89 cm.  (Bk horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with weathered bedrock at 89 cm.  (Cr horizon)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nLithologic discontinuities have not been recognized in this series.  Texture and/or color changes in C or BC horizons have been attributed to the inherent interbedded nature of the parent material.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
