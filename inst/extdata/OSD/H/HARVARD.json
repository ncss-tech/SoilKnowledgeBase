  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Harvard soils typically are on outwash plains or stream terraces and, in some places, are on alluvial fans above the level of flooding.  The soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying stratified loamy outwash or alluvial sediments of Wisconsinan Age.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.9 to 12.2  degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation varies from 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 150 to 180 days, and the elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1020 feet) above sea level."

The well drained Alvin soils are on similar landforms that do not have a mantle of loess.  The somewhat poorly drained Brenton and Millbrook soils are on slightly lower lying landforms.  The well drained Camden and Proctor soils form a biosequence with Harvard soils and are on similar landform positions.  The well drained Downs soils are developed entirely in loess and are on higher lying areas.  The poorly drained Drummer soils are in depressions or lower lying areas."
