  "OVERVIEW": "The Harvard series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying stratified loamy outwash or alluvial sediments.  They are on outwash plains, stream terraces, and alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches).",

The well drained Alvin soils are on similar landforms that do not have a mantle of loess.  The somewhat poorly drained Brenton and Millbrook soils are on slightly lower lying landforms.  The well drained Camden and Proctor soils form a biosequence with Harvard soils and are on similar landform positions.  The well drained Downs soils are developed entirely in loess and are on higher lying areas.  The poorly drained Drummer soils are in depressions or lower lying areas."
