  "OVERVIEW": "The Hooverton series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on canyon sides.  They formed in colluvium from basalt.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 35 to 75 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",
