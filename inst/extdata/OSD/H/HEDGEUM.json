  "OVERVIEW": "The Hedgeum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 20 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 95 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 through 5 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.
