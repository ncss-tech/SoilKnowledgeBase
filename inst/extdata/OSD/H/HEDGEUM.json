The particle-size control section has andic soil properties with a cumulative thickness of 30 to 45 inches and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 20 to 30 percent for air dried samples.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 through 5 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  It is medial fine sandy loam, medial very fine sandy loam, or medial silt loam.  Reaction is moderately or strongly acid.
