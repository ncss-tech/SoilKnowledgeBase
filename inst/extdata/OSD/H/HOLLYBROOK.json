  "OVERVIEW": "The Hollybrook series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy soil materials. Hollybrook soils are on reconstructed landforms on mined areas of till plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nParticle-size control section: averages 20 to 34 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent sand\nOrganic carbon content: decreases irregularly with depth because of layering and the presence of coal fragments\nOther features: The individual layers within the soil are variable in thickness and composition. Most pedons have soil clods with relict horizons from pre-mined soils which are randomly distributed throughout the soil. Many of the soil clods have identifiable properties which include redox features and clay films that are characteristic of the pre-mined soil. The gravel and channers are dominantly very strongly cemented or indurated. These soils were reconstructed with dozers and earth moving pans. They have a series of compacted layers in the AC and C horizons. Tillage after soil grading has generally been restricted to the surface layer. The compacted layers have high bulk density which restricts root penetration and water movement in the soil.\nAp horizon:\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 4 or 5\nChroma: 3 to 6\nTexture: silt loam\nStructure: weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky\nRock fragment content: 0 to 3 percent, mainly chert or channers of indurated sandstone, siltstone, or shale\nReaction: moderately acid to neutral\nA/Cd horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 1 to 8\nTexture: commonly silt loam and less commonly silty clay loam, with pockets of loam or clay loam in some pedons\nStructure: massive platy clods that are 6 mm to 5 cm (1/4 to 2 inches) thick with horizontal cleavage planes and vertical cracks that are 2 to 15 cm (1 to 6 inches) apart\nConsistence: very firm or extremely firm, and commonly brittle\nRock fragment content: 1 to 5 percent, mainly chert or channers of indurated sandstone, siltstone, or shale\nReaction: strongly acid to neutral\n2Cd horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 1 to 8\nTexture: commonly silt loam or clay loam and less commonly loam or silty clay loam\nStructure: massive platy clods that are 12 mm to 15 cm (1/2 to 6 inches) thick with horizontal cleavage planes and vertical cracks that are 5 to 30 cm (2 to 12 inches) apart\nConsistence: very firm or extremely firm\nRock fragment content: 1 to 5 percent, mainly chert or channers of indurated sandstone, siltstone or shale; common pockets of soft shale mixed into the lower 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches) in some pedons\nReaction: strongly acid to neutral\n3Cd horizon:\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 7\nChroma: 1 to 8\nTexture: dominantly silty clay loam or silty clay or the parachannery or very parachannery analogs of these textures, with strata or pockets of silt loam, loam, or clay loam in some pedons\nConsistence: very firm to friable\nRock fragment content: 2 to 14 percent, mainly indurated sandstone, siltstone or shale\nReaction: slightly acid or neutral"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hollybrook soils are typically on mined areas of till plains. They are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of reconstructed landforms. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. The soils formed in loamy soil materials that were excavated and reclaimed during surface mining. The upper 102 to 203 cm (40 to 80 inches) of the regolith is mostly a mixture of loess and loamy material from till of the pre-mined soils. The lower part of the regolith consists mainly of shale with pockets of the subsoil and substratum of the pre-mined soils, and includes sandstone and siltstone rock fragments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11.7 to 13.3 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 183 to 274 meters (600 to 900 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat excessively drained Minnehaha soils are on backslopes of spoil hills. The well drained Nawakwa and Tapawingo soils are on similar landform positions as the Hollybrook soils. The moderately well drained Ava and Shakamak soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes. The well drained Hickory soils are on backslopes. The Vigo soils are on summits."
