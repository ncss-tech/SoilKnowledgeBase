    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer between depths of 8 and 24 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F. where the soil has an 0 horizon.  Depth to fractured bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. Clay content is 10 to 18 percent throughout the soil.  The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The fine-earth fraction of the particle-size control section contains greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 2.0 percent, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture based on an air-dried sample.  Moist bulk density is 0.85 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 30 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam, very cobbly silt loam or very gravelly loam.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 40 percent cobbles and 15 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely cobbly loam, very cobbly silt loam or very cobbly loam.  Rock fragments range from 50 to 75 percent cobbles and 5 to 15 percent gravel."
