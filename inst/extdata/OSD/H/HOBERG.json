  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 80 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from l6 to 36 inches.  Chert gravel content in the A and upper Bt horizons is 0 to 15 percent, 5 to 35 percent in the lower Bt horizon, just above the 2Btx, and 10 to 80 percent in the 2Btx and 3Bt horizons.  Chert cobble content above the fragipan is less than 10 percent but ranges to 40 percent within the fragipan. Reaction is slightly to strongly acid in the A and Bt horizons and moderately acid to extremely acid in the 2Btx and 3Bt horizons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe BA and BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam with 0 to 5 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6, but may be 2 immediately above the fragipan.  Some pedons have iron depletions with chroma of 2 within the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam.\nThe Btx or 2Btx horizon has mottled colors with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is the gravelly to extremely gravelly or cobbly analogues of silty clay loam, silt loam or clay loam.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6 with distinct mottles.  It is the gravelly to extremely gravelly or cobbly analogues of clay or silty clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hoberg soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. They formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying residuum from cherty limestone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 44 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Creldon, Eldon, Gerald, Keeno, Newtonia and Pembroke soils. Eldon, Newtonia and Pembroke soils do not have a fragipan. Gerald soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Keeno soils are in the loamy-skeletal particle size family.  Creldon soils are on similar landscapes as the Hoberg soils. Gerald soils are on nearly level uplands at higher elevations than the Hoberg soils. Eldon, Keeno, Newtonia, and Pembroke soils are on ridgetops and upper side slopes below the Hoberg soils."

In undisturbed areas, a perched water table has an upper limit of 1 to 3 feet during December to March in most years."

Hoberg soils were previously classified as Mollic Fragiudalfs, but were changed to Oxyaquic Fragiudalfs based on the 1998 \"Keys to Taxonomy\".\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches;\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 7 inches to 72 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);\nfragipan - the zone from approximately 22 to 47 inches (2Btx horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
