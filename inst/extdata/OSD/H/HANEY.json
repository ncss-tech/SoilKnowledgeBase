Jugtown soils have rock fragments of sandstone, chert, and shale. Reaville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Thackery soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section."

Haney soils in MLRA 99 are being converted to Cygnet or Shawtown series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 41 cm (Ap, BE horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 41 to 86 cm (Bt horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below the ochric epipedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
