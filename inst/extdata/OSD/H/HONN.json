  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 25 to 40 inches to the bottom of the argillic horizon, and mean annual soil temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F.  The soils are dry in the moisture control section from about June 1 to September 30 most years.  The A horizon colors are grayish brown to pale brown in 10YR hues and have values of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  Chromas are 2 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  Texture ranges from gravelly sandy loam to gravelly fine sandy loam; structure from moderate granular in the upper A to massive in the lower A horizon.   Consistence is hard in some part of the upper A horizon.  Reaction is medium acid to slightly acid. The B1t and B2t horizon colors are brown to very pale brown in hues of 10YR and 7.5YR with values of 5, 6 and 7 dry; 3 or 4 moist.  Chromas are 3 or 4 both moist and dry.  Texture ranges from gravelly light sandy clay loam to clay loam and in reaction from strongly acid to medium acid.  The IIB3t and IIC horizons have variegated colors in yellowish browns with dark reddish brown, dark grayish brown and dark reddish brown mottles. The horizons are weakly cemented."

The Churn soils have light yellowish brown A horizons.  The Los Robles soils have brown clay loam A horizons and brown, heavy clay loam, neutral B2t horizons.  The Millrace soils have very gravelly loamy sand B2t horizons.  The Molinos soils lack B2t horizons and are neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Honn soils occur on nearly level or gently sloping low terraces under oak-grass vegetation. Underlying alluvium is slowly permeable, dense gravelly clay loam or clay.  The soils occur at elevations of 300 to 800 feet in a Mediterranean climate with mean annual rainfall of 25 to 40 inches, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 to 62 degrees F., average January temperature about 41 degrees F., and average July temperature about 78 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 250 days."
