Akela soils are moist for more than 20 days during the summer and receive the majority of its moisture during the summer months. Dalvord soils have granitic parent materials. Galehills soils have 10 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the B horizons and sandstone conglomerate parent material. Noble Pass soils have 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the control section. Hindu soils have 20 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalence and formed from calcareous sedimentary bedrock. Paintrocks soils have granitic parent materials and 1 to 3 inches deep to paralithic contact or bedrock. Sutra soils have 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalence and formed from limestone bedrock. Terlingua soils have a paralithic contact at 4 to 14 inches which makes it a typic torriorthents and not lithic. Upspring soils have a dry moisture control section from June through November."

Elevations are 1,800 to 4,700 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 200 to 340 days."
