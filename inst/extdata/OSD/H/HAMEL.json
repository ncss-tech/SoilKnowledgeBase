  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates range from 30 to 65 inches.  The mollic epipedon thickness ranges from 24 to 60 inches.  Typically the upper colluvim contains less than 2 percent gravel by volume and the lower part contains 2 to 6 percent gravel by volume of mixed lithology.\nThe A horizons have hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Typically it is loam or clay loam, but silt loam or silty clay loam are within the range.  It has coatings of clean sand and silt particles in the lower part of the A horizon in some pedons.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam high in sand, or loam.  It has between 25 and 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine sand and coarser.  It has B/A clay ratios of 1.2 to 1.4.  It has few to many, faint to prominent clay films.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of a 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The clay content ranges from 18 to 32 percent and the total sand content ranges from 25 to 45 percent."

The Alvada series (Tentative - OH) is not in the OSD file at this time.  The Barry, Berville, Brookston, Cordova, Marengo, Millgrove, Navan, Rensselaer, and Westland soils have a mollic epipedon that is less than 24 inches thick.   The Buntingville soils have carbonates at depths of less than 20 inches.  The Clackamas and Nosoni soils lack free carbonates in the series control section.\nThe Forestcity soils have 45 to 65 percent sand and 10 to 18 percent clay in the underlying material.  The Jamestown soils formed in a firm and very firm till associated with the Iowan Erosional surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hamel soils have concave slopes in swales, rims of closed depressions, foot and toe slopes, and upper drainageways below sloping to very steep slopes.  Slope gradients are 1 to 4 percent.  Hamel soils formed in slope colluvium and glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 48 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 to 30 inches.  Frost free days range from 125 to 165.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1600 feet."
