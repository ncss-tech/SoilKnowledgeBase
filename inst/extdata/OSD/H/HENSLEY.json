  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly rangeland. Some areas are used for small grain. The climax plant community is a tall grass savannah with post oak, blackjack oak, and live oak throughout the landscape. The dominant grass is little bluestem.  Other grasses include big bluestem, yellow Indiangrass, sideoats grama, wildrye, plains lovegrass, Texas wintergrass, vine mesquite, pinhole bluestem, meadow dropseed, Texas cupgrass, curly mesquite, and buffalograss. Woody plants include live oak, post oak, blackjack oak, redbud, greenbriar, and hackberry. Forbs, such as velvet bundleflower, Engelmann daisy, orange zexmenia, and Mexican sagewort, are present. The site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of Ashe juniper, Texas persimmon, prickly pear, mesquite, live oak, Texas grama, hairy tridens, red grama, prairie coneflower, and broomweed."
