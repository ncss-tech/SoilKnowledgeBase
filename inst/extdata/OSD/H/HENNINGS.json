    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Glenham, Gosper, Houdek, Ree, Reventon, Verdigre, Wewela, and Wineg series in the same family. Glenham and Houdek soils formed in glacial till.  In addition, Glenham soils have free carbonates within depths of 20 inches and Houdek soils have Bk horizons over 15 inches thick.  Gosper soils formed in alluvium and typically have free carbonates at a depth of 10 to 24 inches.  Ree soils have Bk horizons over 10 inches thick.  Reventon soils have free carbonates within a depth of 14 inches.  Verdigre soils have bedded shale at a depth between 40 and 60 inches.  Wewela soils have shale bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Wineg soils have a calcic horizon and have 14 to 16 inches mean annual precipitation."
