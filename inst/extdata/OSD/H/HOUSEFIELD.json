Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The soil reaction is typically neutral to slightly alkaline but very strongly alkaline surface phases are recognized.  The organic matter content throughout the particle-size control section ranges from 10 to 20 percent and averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  Depth to redoximorphic iron concentrations is from 6 to 16 inches.  The soils are frequently ponded with up to 3 feet of water on the surface from March to July.\nThe A horizon has a chroma of 1 or 2. It has 15 to 25 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has a value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is mucky silt loam, in the upper part grading to mucky silty clay loam in the lower part.
