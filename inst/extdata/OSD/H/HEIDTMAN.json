  "OVERVIEW": "The Heidtman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  Heidtman soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
