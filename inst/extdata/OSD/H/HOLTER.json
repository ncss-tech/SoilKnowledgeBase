  "OVERVIEW": "The Holter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from igneous, argillite, or fine grained sedimentary rock.  These soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The 1998 OSD listed more than 60 percent in these horizons but the NASIS data did not support fragment ranges that high."
