The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the typical pedon (S59(61) NMex-7-16) are on pages 790 and 791 in Gile, L.H. and R.B.
