  "REVDATE": "08/2006",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hachita series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous rocks such as rhyolite.  Hachita soils are on alluvial terraces, fans and fan piedmonts with slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research."
