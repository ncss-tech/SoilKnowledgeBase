  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to siliceous sandy alluvium range from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 24 inches.  The particle size control section averages from 10 to 17 percent clay and from 45 to 75 percent sand.  The particle size control section and the sandy alluvium contain less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction.  Coarse fragments typically are absent, but the volume of sandstone gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the loamy mantle, but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the sandy alluvium.  Free carbonates are absent to a depth of more than 80 inches.   Either redox features and aquic conditions occur within 16 inches of the surface or aquic conditions occur directly below the mollic epipedon with redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less as the matrix or as masses in the matrix.\nThe Ap or A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  Typically, it is sandy loam or fine sandy loam but some pedons have subhorizons of loam.\nSome pedons have a thin 2Bt horizon with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2BC horizon has color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described above.  In some pedons, it is the color of the uncoated sand grains.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6.  In many pedons, the color is that of the uncoated sand grains."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in siliceous loamy alluvium underlain by siliceous sandy alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1100 feet."

The moderately well drained Bilmod soils and the well drained Bilson soils form a drainage sequence with Hoop soils.  The well drained Merit soils, the moderately well drained Merimod soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Sooner soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is more silt and clay and less sand in the soil."

Hoop soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period November to May in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil may not be a Mollisol because it may have base saturation of less than 50 percent (by NH4OAc) in some horizon between the top of the argillic horizon and a depth of 125 cm below the top of the argillic.  It would then classify as Aquultic Hapludalfs.  No laboratory data are available.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - 0 to 11 inches (Ap, A); argillic horizon - 11 to 24 inches (Bt1, Bt2); aquic feature - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and aquic conditions within 16 inches of the soil surface; siliceous feature - less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the particle-size control section (0.02 to 2 mm fraction)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record - WI0555.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
