  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoop series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in siliceous loamy alluvium underlain by siliceous sandy alluvium on stream terraces and pediments.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid in the sandy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to siliceous sandy alluvium range from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 24 inches.  The particle size control section averages from 10 to 17 percent clay and from 45 to 75 percent sand.  The particle size control section and the sandy alluvium contain less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction.  Coarse fragments typically are absent, but the volume of sandstone gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the loamy mantle, but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the sandy alluvium.  Free carbonates are absent to a depth of more than 80 inches.   Either redox features and aquic conditions occur within 16 inches of the surface or aquic conditions occur directly below the mollic epipedon with redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less as the matrix or as masses in the matrix.\nThe Ap or A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  Typically, it is sandy loam or fine sandy loam but some pedons have subhorizons of loam.\nSome pedons have a thin 2Bt horizon with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2BC horizon has color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described above.  In some pedons, it is the color of the uncoated sand grains.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6.  In many pedons, the color is that of the uncoated sand grains."

The moderately well drained Bilmod soils and the well drained Bilson soils form a drainage sequence with Hoop soils.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil may not be a Mollisol because it may have base saturation of less than 50 percent (by NH4OAc) in some horizon between the top of the argillic horizon and a depth of 125 cm below the top of the argillic.  It would then classify as Aquultic Hapludalfs.  No laboratory data are available.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - 0 to 11 inches (Ap, A); argillic horizon - 11 to 24 inches (Bt1, Bt2); aquic feature - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and aquic conditions within 16 inches of the soil surface; siliceous feature - less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the particle-size control section (0.02 to 2 mm fraction)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record - WI0555.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
