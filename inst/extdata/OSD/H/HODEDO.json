  "OVERVIEW": "The Hodedo series consists of moderately deep over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Hodedo soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
