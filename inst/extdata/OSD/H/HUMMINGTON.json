    "content": "REMARKS:\nClassification changed based on 1998 Keys to Soil Taxonomy\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon\n*Umbric epipedon--zone from 4 to 83 cm\n*Particle-size control section--zone from 4 to 83 cm\n*Andic soil properties--zone from 4 to 83 cm\n*Volcanic glass--zone from 4 to 83 cm\n*Depth to lithic contact--83 cm\n06/2016--Assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) for andic soil properties, in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that in the Willamette National Forest enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. The amount of ash in the soils in Douglas, Linn, and Lane Counties is unknown. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence.\n08/2016--This series was reclassified from Dystric Cryandepts to Typic Fulvicryands when the Andisol soil order was established in the 4th edition of Soil Taxonomy. The organic matter content is too low in the data for the Hummington soils in NASIS, in the Hummington soils in the Douglas County soil survey manuscript, and in the Hummington sample pedon to support the Fulvicryand great group. The Hummington soils need to be investigated further; however, given observations in the Willamette National Forest, it is believed that they will not meet the criteria for Fulvicryands. These soils were reclassified as Typic Haplocryands.\nMore investigation is needed to confirm that the zone from 25 to 50 cm has 2.0 cmol of Al (1n KCL).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nCharacterization data--pedon S75OR-39-11(1-5), Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; partial characterization data by Oregon State University reported in the Soil Survey of South Umpqua Area, Oregon, and sample RZ91-OR077-247, 248 from Douglas County, Oregon, Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska, 6/1991\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
