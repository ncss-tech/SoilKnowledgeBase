The organic matter content is too low in the data for the Hummington soils in NASIS, in the Hummington soils in the Douglas County soil survey manuscript, and in the Hummington sample pedon  to support the Fulvicryand great group. The Hummington soils need to be investigated further; however, given observations in the Willamette National Forest, it is believed that they will not meet the criteria for Fulvicryands. These soils were reclassified as Typic Haplocryands.\nMore investigation is needed to confirm that the zone from 25 to 50 cm has 2.0 cmol of Al (1n KCL)."
