    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 40 to 80 inches thick. Weathered bedrock is at more than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 59 degrees F.  The soils between a depth of about 4 to 16 inches are usually moist, but become dry sometime in June and remain dry until sometime in October.  Organic matter content is 4 to 10 percent in the A horizon; it is 1.5 to 2.5 percent in the upper 40 inches, or in the upper 6 to 10 inches of the Bt horizons, or both.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 7.5YR 5/4, 5/2, 4/4, 4/2; 5YR 5/8, 5/6, 5/4, 5/3, 4/6, 4/4 or 4/3.  The surface few inches in some pedons are 7.5YR 6/4 or 10YR 6/2.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/4; 5YR 3/4, 3/3; or 2.5YR 3/4.  Below a depth of 0 to 5 inches moist chroma is 4, 6 or 8.  Chroma is commonly less than 4 above these depths.  It is loam, gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam with 10 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction is medium to slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has dry colors of 7.5YR 6/6, 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 4/6, 4/4; 5YR 6/6, 5/8, 5/6, 5/4, 4/8, 4/6; 2.5YR 4/8, 4/6 or 3/6 and moist colors of 7.5YR 5/8, 4/6, 4/4; 5YR 4/6, 4/4; 2.5YR 4/8 or 3/6.  It is loam, clay loam, gravelly loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent coarse fragments.  Base saturation is 15 to 45 percent, but less than 35 percent below a depth of 60 inches.  Reaction is medium to very strongly acid and is more acid with depth.\nThe 2B and 3C horizons are very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam or stratified sands and gravel with 15 to 65 percent coarse fragments."

They formed in materials from gravelly Tertiary terrace remnants and basic volcanic rocks, principally tuff breccia.  Climate has warm dry summers and cool wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 85 inches, some of which falls as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F; average January temperature is about 40 degrees F; average July temperature is about 70 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 140 to 230 days."
