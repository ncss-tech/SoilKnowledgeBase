  "OVERVIEW": "The Horseshoe series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in materials from gravelly Tertiary terrace remnants and basic volcanic rocks, principally tuff breccia.  These soils are on broad tabular ridges and sideslopes with slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

The soils between a depth of about 4 to 16 inches are usually moist, but become dry sometime in June and remain dry until sometime in October.  Organic matter content is 4 to 10 percent in the A horizon; it is 1.5 to 2.5 percent in the upper 40 inches, or in the upper 6 to 10 inches of the Bt horizons, or both.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 7.5YR 5/4, 5/2, 4/4, 4/2; 5YR 5/8, 5/6, 5/4, 5/3, 4/6, 4/4 or 4/3.  The surface few inches in some pedons are 7.5YR 6/4 or 10YR 6/2.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/4; 5YR 3/4, 3/3; or 2.5YR 3/4.  Below a depth of 0 to 5 inches moist chroma is 4, 6 or 8.  Chroma is commonly less than 4 above these depths.  It is loam, gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam with 10 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction is medium to slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has dry colors of 7.5YR 6/6, 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 4/6, 4/4; 5YR 6/6, 5/8, 5/6, 5/4, 4/8, 4/6; 2.5YR 4/8, 4/6 or 3/6 and moist colors of 7.5YR 5/8, 4/6, 4/4; 5YR 4/6, 4/4; 2.5YR 4/8 or 3/6.  It is loam, clay loam, gravelly loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent coarse fragments.  Base saturation is 15 to 45 percent, but less than 35 percent below a depth of 60 inches.  Reaction is medium to very strongly acid and is more acid with depth.\nThe 2B and 3C horizons are very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam or stratified sands and gravel with 15 to 65 percent coarse fragments."
