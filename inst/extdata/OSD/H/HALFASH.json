  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Halfash soils are on mountains and plateaus.  They typically occur on shoulder, backslope or footslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite and tuff breccia with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,015 to 2,685 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 350 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
