  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist and is saturated for about 5 to 7 months. It is slightly acid or moderately acid. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F under tree and shrub cover.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is single grain or has weak granular structure. In areas having thick stands of plant,s there is a 1/2 to 1 inch 0i horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3. It has common to many distinct masses of iron accumulations. In some pedons masses of iron are not detectable.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand. It is single grain or massive."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Heceta soils are in long narrow interdunal swales, depressions, deflation plains and sandy lowlands. They formed in recently stabilized dune sand. Elevation is near sea level to 80 feet. The winters are cool and wet and the summers are cool and moist with many days of fog or low cloud cover. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 300 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Netarts, Waldport, and Yaquina soils. Netarts and Yaquina soils have a spodic horizon. Waldport soils are well drained. Netarts soils occur on older, stabilized dunes. Yaquina soils occur in older slightly convex interdunal positions and deflation plains. Waldport soils occur on active and recently stabilized sand dunes."
