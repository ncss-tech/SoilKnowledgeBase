  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hechtman series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from rhyolite beds.  Hechtman soils are on nearly level to steep mountain sides.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is about 32 to 36 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  Rock fragments in the control section are mainly pebbles and range from 35 to 65 percent and clay content ranges from 8 to 15 percent.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is slightly or moderately acid.  This horizon rests on the underlying bedrock or on a thin layer of rock fragments over the bedrock."

The Banker, Jarbidge, and Treebutte soils have a xeric moisture regime. The Caseypeak, Merino, Pendergrass, and Sigbird soils have an ustic moisture regime. The Cobblank soils have a subarctic climate. The Cowood soils have 60 to 80 percent coarse fragments in the Bw horizon. The Hotter soils have mean summer soil temperatures of 50 to 59 degrees F., do not have an O horizon, and formed in slope alluvium or residuum from sandstone and shale. The Illiano soils have 20 to 50 percent volcanic glass in the particle-size control section."

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified."
