    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hoff soils are on summits and slopes of hills and mountains at elevations of 3,800 to 7,050 feet. Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from basalt and volcanic ash. The average annual precipitation is 24 to 36 inches. The average annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
