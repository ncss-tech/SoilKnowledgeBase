(A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from about 3 to 14 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact: The boundary at about 14 inches.  (2Cr layer)\nIn February 2002 the lithic contact was changed to a paralithic contact and the taxonomic class was changed from Lithic Haplustalfs to shallow Aridic Haplustalfs. These changes were recommended following fieldwork on the Bandelier National Monument.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Sampled for mineralogy and sent to the SCS Laboratory at Riverside during 1974.
