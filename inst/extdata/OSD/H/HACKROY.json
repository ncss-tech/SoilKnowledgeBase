  "OVERVIEW": "The Hackroy series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in material weathered from tuff or basalt on summits, beveled summits, and shoulders of mesas and undulating plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

(A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from about 3 to 14 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact: The boundary at about 14 inches.  (2Cr layer)\nIn February 2002 the lithic contact was changed to a paralithic contact and the taxonomic class was changed from Lithic Haplustalfs to shallow Aridic Haplustalfs. These changes were recommended following fieldwork on the Bandelier National Monument.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999."
