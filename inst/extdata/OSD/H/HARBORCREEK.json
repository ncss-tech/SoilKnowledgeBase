    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 centimeters (12 to 23 inches) 30 to 60 centimeters. Bedrock is deeper than 152 centimeters (60 inches). Rock fragment lithology is dominantly shale and sandstone with minor amounts of limestone and granitic erratics. Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 40 percent by volume in the A horizon, 20 to 55 percent in the B horizon, and 30 to 80 percent in the C horizon, with some thin stratified layers having more or fewer rock fragments.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. It has weak or moderate, medium or fine granular structure, some pedons range to subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction, unless limed, is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or very coarse sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is very weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon ranging from 10 to 50 centimeters (4 to 20 inches) in thickness. Hue is 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 5.  Texture of the fine earth is typically loamy sand, but ranges from very coarse sandy loam to fine sand.  Structure is very weak or weak, fine to coarse, subangular blocky. Consistence is friable to loose.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. They are stratified loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, or sand in the fine earth fraction. They are single grained and loose. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brandywine, Gloucester, and Hoosic series in the same family. Gloucester soils lack stratified C horizons. Brandywine soils lack stratified C horizons and formed in materials weatherd from granitic gniess.  Hoosic soils have a rock fragment lithology dominated by slate and phyllite.\nThe Chenango, Otisville, and Wyoming series are similar soils in related families. Chenango and Wyoming soils have loamy skeletal particle-size control sections. Otisville soils lack cambic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harborcreek soils are nearly level to undulating soils mainly on beach ridges, but also on other related lacustrine landforms. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. The soils formed in water-sorted sandy and gravelly material dominated by sandstone and shale. Mean annual precipation ranges from 965 to 1168 millimeters (38 to 46 inches) and mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.7 to 10.5 degrees C (46 to 51 degrees F). Mean annual frost free period ranges from 165 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above sea level."

Pompton, Red Hook, Elnora, Harbor and Painesville soils all have redoximorphic features within 60 centimeters (24 inches) of the soil surface. Colonie soils have lamellae and contain less than 5 percent rock fragments in the upper 122 centimeters (48 inches)."
