The soils are usually moist\nbut are dry between depth of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80\nconsecutive days during the summer.  Depth to a lithic\ncontact is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt is 5 to 15\ninches.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 80 percent in the\ncontrol section.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to\n20 inches.  The solum ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and\nchroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent\nstones, 10 to 15 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent\ngravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry\nand chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.
