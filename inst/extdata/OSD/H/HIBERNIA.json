  "OVERVIEW": "The Hibernia series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils in low positions on undulating uplands.  The soils are shallow or moderately deep to a fragipan.  They formed in till and colluvial material.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Permeability is moderate above the fragipan, slow in the fragipan, and moderate to rapid in the substratum.  Mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  Depth to bedrock is typically greater than 6 feet.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent throughout the solum, and from 0 to 60 percent in the C horizon.  Rock fragments are a mixture of gravel, cobbles, stones, and boulders in varying proportions.  The rock fragments are primarily granitic gneiss with smaller amounts of sandstone, quartzite, and shale.  Quartz, feldspar, and mica, with smaller amounts of ferromagnesian minerals dominate mineralogy.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid in the A and BA horizons, except where limed, and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Ap horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures range from silt loam to sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have an E horizon 2 to 5 inches thick.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  The range for texture, structure, and consistence is the same as that for the A horizon.\nThe BA or BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture ranges from silt loam to sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It has redoximorphic features with high and low chroma in these and other hues.  Texture in individual subhorizons ranges from loam or sandy clay loam to sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It has high and low chroma redoximorphic features in these and other hues.  Redoximorphic features are commonly concentrated along vertically oriented streaks in vertical sections and polygonal patterns in horizontal sections.  Structure is weak or moderate thick or very thick platy, weak to strong very coarse prismatic, subangular blocky, or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8, or it is mottled with these and other hues.  Texture is commonly loamy sand or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction but the range includes sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in some pedons."

Permeability is moderate above the fragipan, slow in the fragipan, and moderate to rapid in the substratum.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to high above the fragipan, moderately low or moderately high in the fragipan, and moderately low to very high in the substratum. A perched water table is commonly ranges within a foot of the surface in late winter and early spring and following periods of extended rainfall.  Lateral seepage to the surface is common, particularly at slope breaks."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (A and BA horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 25 inches (Bt horizon).\n3. Fragipan - the firm, brittle zone from 25 to 36 inches (Bx horizon).\n4. Aquic feature - low chroma depletions are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon (Bt2 horizon)."
