  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  Coarse fragments of chert, quartz, and feldspar range from 15 to 70 percent by volume in the A horizon and from 35 to about 55 percent in the B horizon.\nThe A and E horizons are grayish brown to pink in hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture ranges from gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam or loamy sand and the thickness ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  Reaction range is medium acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is prominently to distinctly mottled with dry colors of red  to gray in hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 and chroma 2 through 8.  Gray mottles in the upper 6 inches of the Bt horizon generally decrease in number with depth.  Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from sandy clay loam to clay loam; clay content is about 27 to 35 percent.  Reaction of the Bt horizon ranges from strongly acid through neutral.\nSome pedons have a reddish to yellowish Bt3 horizon with or without mottles.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.  Reaction ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline.  Some pedons have a few weakly cemented calcium carbonate concretions below 50 inches.\nThe 2C horizon ranges from light gray to pale olive in hue of 5Y through 10YR, value 6 or 7, and chroma 1 through 4. Texture is clay or sandy clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to about 25 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline and calcareous."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Their are no competing series in the same taxonomic class.  Similar soils include the Axtell, Chaney, Crockett, Fett, Hilgrave, Selden, Tabor, Vashti, and Voca series.  All these soils, except Fett and Hilgrave have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Axtell, Chaney, Crockett, Fett, Tabor, and Voca soils have more than 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction of the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Hilgrave soils lack mottles with chromas of 2 or less in the control section and have thinner sola.  Selden soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Vashti soils are underlain with sandstone within 20 to 50 inches of the surface, and the clay content of the Bt horizon decreases with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hornsby soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping ridges paralleling major streams.  Slopes range from 1 to about 5 percent, and the surfaces are plane to convex.  The soil formed in noncalcareous gravelly, sandy, and loamy ancient alluvium several feet thick.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Average annual rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches, Thornthwaite P-E Indices range from 42 to about 55.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 67 degrees to 70 degrees F."
