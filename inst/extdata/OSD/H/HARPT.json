  "OVERVIEW": "The Harpt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium mainly from acid igneous rocks.  Harpt soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
