  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are moist in some part above 12 inches for at least half the time during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., in most years but are dry throughout between 4 and 12 inches for 70 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months in most years.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 54 degrees F.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to secondary lime is 15 to 30 inches.  The organic matter decreases irregularly with depth and is greater than 0.5% at depth of 50 inches or more.  The 10- to 40- inch control section is commonly silt loam but ranges to very fine sandy loam or silt.  Thin lenses, less than 2 inch thick, of fine sandy loam occur below 30 inches.  When mixed, it has 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe  A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak or moderate granular or weak very fine to medium subangular blocky structure in the upper part and is massive in the lower part.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has firm, calcareous nodules ranging from 0 to 20 percent by volume.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 through 6 moist and 5 through 8 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mildly to  strongly alkaline.  Below 30 inches in some pedons, there are very thin, noncalcareous volcanic ash lenses with dry value of 7 or 8."

Covello soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 32 inches and are somewhat poorly drained with a permanent water table at about 4 feet.  Mondovi soils have moist value of 2 to depths of 40 inches or more and are noncalcareous.  Onyx soils are noncalcareous.  Pedigo soils are calcareous throughout the mollic epipedon.  Powder soils  are usually dry.  Touchet soils have mottles in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hermiston soils are on stream bottomlands and low terraces at elevations of 200 to 2500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium from silty loess and ash. The climate is semiarid, with moist, cool, winters and dry, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 195 days."
