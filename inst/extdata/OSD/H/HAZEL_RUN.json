    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hazel Run soils formed in old alluvium from crystalline rock and metasediments of the Blue Ridge Anticlinorium; igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary of the Triassic Basin; and schists and phyllites of the northern Piedmont. They are on treads and risers on river terraces and summits, shoulders, and backslopes of side slopes on ridges. Slope gradients range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature 55.7 degrees F., with average winter temperature of 35.4 degrees F and average summer temperature of 74.6 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36.47 to 48.39 inches, frost free days range from 237 to 185 days, and elevation ranges from 110 feet to 900 feet above sea level."
