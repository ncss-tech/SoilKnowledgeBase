  "OVERVIEW": "The Hollister series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in calcareous alluvial clays of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level and very gently sloping soils are on broad plain terraces of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA-78C, MLRA-78B).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F) and the mean annual precipitation is 635 mm (25 in).",
