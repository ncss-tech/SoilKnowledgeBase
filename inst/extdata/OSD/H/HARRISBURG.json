These soils formed in residuum from sandstone and wind blown sediments from sandstone, volcanic ash and shale. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 200 days in Utah and ranges to 240 days in Arizona. Average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 11 inches."

Pintura soils are in a sandy family and lack petrocalcic horizons. Tobler soils lack petrocalcic horizons.  Winkel soils are less than 20 inches deep to the petrocalcic horizon and have loamy-skeletal control sections."
