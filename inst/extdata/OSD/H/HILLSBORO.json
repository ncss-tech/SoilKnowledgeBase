    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for more than 45 consecutive days during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 to 56 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon is dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4, 4/4) or dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist and pale brown (10YR 6/3) or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) dry. It is loam or silt loam and has 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon. This horizon has dominantly weak subangular blocky structure that ranges to moderate. Clay films are few to many and thin to moderately thick.\nStratified lenses of loamy and sandy material occur below depth of 40 inches."

Larkin soils have moist value of 2 and chroma of 1 or 2 in the upper part of the mollic epipedon, have silty clay loam argillic horizons and have light gray silt coatings on surfaces of peds. Latourell soils have ochric epipedons and have more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Naff soils formed in loess and have very dark brown A horizons and silty clay loam argillic horizons.  Van Horn soils have clay loam and sandy clay loam argillic horizons with more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Willamette soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 20 inches."

The soils formed in mixed, silty and loamy old alluvium. The climate is humid temperate with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The average July temperature is 67 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 39 degrees F.; the average annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F. The average annual rainfall is 40 to 50 inches. The frost free period is 165 to 210 days."
