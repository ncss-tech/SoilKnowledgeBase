  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon typically is 7 to 9 inches but ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the Bk horizon averages between 15 and 35 percent.  Crystals of gypsum and other salts are at depths of 6 to 35 inches.  The electrical conductivity ranges from 4 to 16 mmhos between the A horizon and the upper 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt loam but is very fine sandy loam or loam in some pedons.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Crystals and nests of gypsum and other salts range from few to common in the upper part of the Bk horizon and common to many in the lower part.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is varved below depths of 19 to 33 inches.  Varves range from 1 mm to 10 mm thick. Mottles in the C horizon are inherent to the parent material and vary widely in amount and intensity.  Crystals and nests of gypsum and other salts are few to common.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

These soils formed in silty, calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments.  The mean annual air temperature rang es from 38 degrees to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Zell soils and the Bearden, Beotia, Eckman, Glyndon, Great Bend, and Putney soils. Zell soils are on similar landscapes.  Bearden soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on less sloping nearby landscapes.  Beotia soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 16 inches thick and are in swales. Eckman and Great Bend soils have a cambic horizon and are on nearly level to moderately sloping nearby landscapes.  In addition, Beotia, Eckman, and Great Bend soils do not have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches.  Glyndon and Putney soils are on less sloping adjacent landscapes. Glyndon soils have a wetter soil moisture control section and less than 4 mmhos electrical conductivity.  Putney soils do not have carbonate at the surface and have a cambic horizon."
