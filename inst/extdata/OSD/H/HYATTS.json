  "STATES": "OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hyatts series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy till of medium lime content and the underlying residuum from soft, acid shale with thin strata of siltstone in some areas. These soils are on bedrock controlled ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
