  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hyatts soils are on foot slopes on bedrock controlled ground moraines of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in loamy till of medium calcium carbonate content and the underlying residuum from soft, acid shale with thin strata of siltstone in some areas. Rock fragments in the till are mainly sandstone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1067 mm (31 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from (8 to 12 degrees C 46 to 54 degrees F)."

The moderately deep, moderately well drained Rarden soils are on similar positions or are on steeper side slopes."
