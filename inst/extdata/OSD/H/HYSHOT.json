  "OVERVIEW": "The Hyshot series consists of well drained, slowly permeable soils that are moderately deep to soft, platy, gypsiferous shale on hillsides.  They formed in slopewash alluvium and residuum derived dominantly from gypsiferous shale.  Slopes range from 6 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.\nThe Bk horizon has 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  EC is 2 to 4 mmhos.\nThe By horizon has 6 to 20 percent gypsum.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons it has up to 70 percent soft, platy shale fragments which break down on pretreatment.  EC is 4 to 8 mmhos.\nThe Cr is soft, platy gypsiferous shale.  It is frequently more than 20 feet thick."
