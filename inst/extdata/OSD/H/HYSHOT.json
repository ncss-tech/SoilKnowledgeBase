The particle-size control section is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.\nThe Bk horizon has 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  EC is 2 to 4 mmhos.\nThe By horizon has 6 to 20 percent gypsum.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons it has up to 70 percent soft, platy shale fragments which break down on pretreatment.  EC is 4 to 8 mmhos.\nThe Cr is soft, platy gypsiferous shale.  It is frequently more than 20 feet thick."
