  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alpin, Catpoint, and Duffern series in the same family. Soils in closely related families are the Bienville, Betis, Darden, Flo, Grapeland, and Tonkawa series. Alpin soils are dry in the moisture control section for less than 60 days in normal years. Catpoint soils contain more gravel in the solum and are dry in the moisture control section for less than 60 days in normal years. Duffern soils formed in Eocene Age sediments on uplands. Bienville, Betis, Flo, and Grapeland soils have an argillic horizon. Darden and Tonkawa soils do not have lamellae within a depth of 80 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hainesville soils are on nearly level Pleistocene Age stream terraces with slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Areas are about 5 to 35 feet above present streams. Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 67 degrees F. Frost free days range from 235 to 275 and elevation ranges from 125 to 350 feet above sea level. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 46 inches and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 64 to 70."

Austonio, Bernaldo, Freestone, and Gallime soils are on slightly higher positions. These soils have a loamy argillic horizon. Derly and Mollville soils are on slightly lower positions. These soils have a loamy or clayey argillic horizon. Portersprings soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar or slightly lower terrace positions."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Hainesville soils are somewhat excessively drained. Runoff is negligible and permeability is rapid. These soils typically do not have a water table within a depth of 6 feet; however, a flooded phase is recognized that is wet in the layers below 4 to 6 feet from mid fall through the spring months in normal years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Hainesville soils were formerly included with the Bienville series. The name is from a small community in Wood County. The series was updated in 2002 to allow very stronly acid reaction in the A horizon and value 5 matrix color in the E horizon based on documentation collected in Shelby County, Texas.  The series was updated in 2004 to clarify that a water table is typically not present within a depth of 6 feet, except in the flooded phase which was correlated in Vernon Parish, Louisiana.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 14 inches (Ap and A horizons).\nLamellae - 58 to 80 inches (Bw/E3 and Bt&E horizons).\nAdditional Data: Houston County, Texas, TAMU Lab. (S90-TX-225-02) (S90-TX-225-04)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
