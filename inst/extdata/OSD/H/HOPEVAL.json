  "OVERVIEW": "The Hopeval series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and outwash derived from mixed rocks.  Hopeval soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
