  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hopeval soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium and outwash derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 10,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches, mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Burnlake soils are loamy-skeletal, have umbric epipedons, do not have aquic conditions, and occur on moraines.  Cavebear soils are sandy-skeletal, do not have aquic conditions within 20 inches of the surface, and occur on adjacent stream terraces."
