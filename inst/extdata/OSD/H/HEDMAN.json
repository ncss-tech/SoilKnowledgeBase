Depth to free carbonates is 16 inches or less with carbonates at the surface in many pedons.  The content of rock fragments ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  Total clay content of the series control section can be over 18 percent but is less than 18 percent after subtracting clay size carbonates.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0 to 2 moist.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam (average clay content is less than 18 percent and sand is 45 to 60 percent).\nSome pedons have a thin Bg horizon above the Bkg horizon.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist.
