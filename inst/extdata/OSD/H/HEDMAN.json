  "OVERVIEW": "The Hedman series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on ground moraines, end moraines and lake plains.  They formed in calcareous, loamy glacial till. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 22 inches.",
