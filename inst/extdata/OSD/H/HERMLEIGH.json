  "OVERVIEW": "The Hermleigh series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous clayey Quaternary lacustrine deposits. These soils are in enclosed depressions on alluvial plain remnants. These nearly level soils are 3 to 25 feet below the surrounding plain and range in size from 5 to 150 acres.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",
