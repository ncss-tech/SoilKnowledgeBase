  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Huckle series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountains. They formed in colluvium over residuum derived from metasedimentary bedrock (predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite), with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 6.5 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 750 mm.",
