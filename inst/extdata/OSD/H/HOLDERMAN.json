It is also assumed enough ash is present in the soils in Willamette National Forest for them to meet criteria 3. Additional samples of the Holderman soils from Douglas County and the Willamette National Forest should be collected to determine whether the soils meet the criteria for the Alic subgroup and whether volcanic ash is in the soils in Lane County.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nType location user site ID--S1975OR039005\nCharacterization data for Lane County--S75OR-39-5 and S75OR-39-6, Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
