  "OVERVIEW": "The Heverlo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in till or in poorly sorted outwash. These soils are on valley sides on till plains. Slope ranges from 25 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
