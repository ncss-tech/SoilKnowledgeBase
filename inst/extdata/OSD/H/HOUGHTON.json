  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carlisle, Catden, Lena, Peteetneet, Saltese, and Semiahmoo series. Carlisle soils derived dominantly from woody materials and contain an average of 15 to 30 percent woody fragments in the control section. Catden soils are derived from woody and herbaceous materials and receive more than 1067 mm of mean annual precipitation. Lena soils contain carbonates throughout the control section. Peteetneet soils are not massive in the bottom tier. Saltese soils have lenses of diatomaceous earth and volcanic ash within a depth of 130 cm (51 inches). Semiahmoo soils are in areas with warm dry summers and mild moist winters, and typically are more acidic throughout the control section."

Slope gradients are less than 2 percent. Houghton soils formed in herbaceous organic materials more than 130 cm (51 inches) thick. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 11.7 degrees C (47 to 53 degrees F)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adrian, Edselton, Edwards, Moston, Muskego, Palms, and Willette soils on similar positions. Adrian soils are underlain by sandy material at depths of 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 inches). Edselton and Edwards soils are underlain by marly material at depths of 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 inches). Moston, and Muskego soils are underlain by coprogenous material at depths of 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 inches). Palms soils are underlain by loamy material at depths of 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 inches). Willette soils are underlain by clayey material at depths of 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 inches).  Poorly or very poorly drained mineral soils are commonly associated along the margins of these areas."

Depth to the seasonal high water table ranges from 61 cm (2 feet) above the surface in ponded phases to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is very low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: A considerable area of these soils is used for cropland or pasture. Common crops are onions, lettuce, potatoes, celery, radishes, carrots, mint, and some corn. Native vegetation is primarily marsh grasses, sedges, reeds, buttonbrush, and cattails, with some water-tolerant trees near the margins of these areas."
