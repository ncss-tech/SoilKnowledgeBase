These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to hilly `a`a lava flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed in sandy material from `a`a lava and from basic volcanic ash. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 1780 millimeters (40 to 70 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
