  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Reaction ranges from neutral to strongly acid in all horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam with clay content ranging between 18 and 35 percent. Subhorizons are in random sequence, variable in thickness, textures are variable, and often the horizons are discontinuous. The blocky or platy structure fragments of the C horizon are not due to pedigenic factors but due to the way the soil material was put into place by mechanical means.\nA buried A horizon is present in some pedons, but most of the time it has been removed and stockpiled for later use. When present, it has hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is usually silt loam but ranges to include silty clay loam.\nThe Bb horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, 4, or 5, and chroma of 3, 4, or 5. It is silty clay loam, but silt loam textures are within the range."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Similar soils are the Dow, Fishpot, Ida, and Kanima series. The Dow and Ida series are calcareous throughout. The Fishpot series formed in disturbed fine-loamy materials greater than 40 inches in thickness. The Kanima series is loamy-skeletal and thermic and formed in dump remains from strip mining operations."

Slope gradients range from 2 to 30 percent. The average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches and mean annual temperature from 52 to 57 degrees F."
