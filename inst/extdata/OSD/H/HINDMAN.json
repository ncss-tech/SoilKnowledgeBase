  "OVERVIEW": "The Hindman series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, sandy eolian deposits over sandy alluvium derived from the Tahoka Formation of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on valley flats and ancestral drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 483 millimeters (19 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",

In open areas and in the understory there are varying\namounts of alkali sacaton, Texas dropseed, creeping muhly, jointtail, sedge and\nrushes, inland saltgrass, and occasionally some western wheatgrass. Forbs include\nportulaca sp., kochia, smartweed, dock and annual forbs. This soil has been\ncorrelated to the Wet Saline (R077CY689TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C."
