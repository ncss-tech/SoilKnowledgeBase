The natural plant community is a mixture of\nsalt tolerant grasses and grass-like plants, forbs, and shrubs. The vegetation\non most of the site is a shrub dominant with saltcedar, Tamarix and Baccharis\nbeing the two most prevalent species. Occasionally there will be a few willows\nand cottonwoods present. In open areas and in the understory there are varying\namounts of alkali sacaton, Texas dropseed, creeping muhly, jointtail, sedge and\nrushes, inland saltgrass, and occasionally some western wheatgrass. Forbs include\nportulaca sp., kochia, smartweed, dock and annual forbs. This soil has been\ncorrelated to the Wet Saline (R077CY689TX) ecological site in MLRA-77C."
