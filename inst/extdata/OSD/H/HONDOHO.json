  "OVERVIEW": "The Hondoho series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in mixed slope alluvium on foothills, mountain slopes, and terraces.   Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 1 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The average annual  temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
