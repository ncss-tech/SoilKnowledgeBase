  "OVERVIEW": "The Hovarka series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite.  Hovarka soils are on floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
