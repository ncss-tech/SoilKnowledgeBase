  "OVERVIEW": "The Hietanen series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from metasedimentary rocks.  Hietanen soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on metamorphic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches, (1651 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F, (13 degrees C).",
