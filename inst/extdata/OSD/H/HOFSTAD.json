    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The combined thickness of the O horizons ranges from 8 to 16 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 40 percent, but the weighted average for the control section is less than 35 percent.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nAn Oa horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue from 5YR to 2.5Y, value from 2 to 4, and chroma from 0 to 3.  Mottles have hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma from 0 to 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe AB horizon has hue from 5YR to 2.5Y, value from 3 to 5, and chroma from 0 to 2.  Mottles are present and have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma from 1 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent gravel or cobbles.\nThe Bg horizon has hue from 7.5YR to 5Y, value from 2 to 5, and chroma from 0 to 4.  Mottles have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma from 1 to 3.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobble.  Texture typically is silt loam, but ranges to include very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma from 0 to 3.  Mottles are present in some pedons.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 40 percent with 0 to 10 percent cobbles."
