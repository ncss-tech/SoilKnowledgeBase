    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet.  The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A horizon and very strongly acid to strongly acid in the B and C horizons.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 25 percent by volume in the A horizon and from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the B horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon of most pedons has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  In eroded pedons the chroma ranges to 8.  The A horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam; or their gravelly analogs.  In eroded pedons the A horizon is clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam; or their gravelly analogs.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is clay loam or clay.  Many fine to medium flakes of mica are in the Bt horizon.\nThe BC horizon has the same hue, value, chroma, and texture as the Bt horizon and, in addition, hue of 5YR.  The BC horizon of some pedons is mottled in shades of red, brown, or yellow.  Many fine to medium flakes of mica are in the BC horizon.\nThe C horizon is saprolite of highly weathered granite, gneiss, or schist that can be crushed to loamy texture.  The C horizon has as much as 20 percent by volume of clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam soil material."

Appling, Aragon, Cecil, Georgeville, Herndon, Mayodan, and Nankin soils have sola more than 40 inches thick.  Chestatee soils have more coarse fragments throughout the solum.  Madison and Pacolet soils have a Bt horizon with hue of 5YR or redder.  Spotsylvania soils have a lithologic discontinuity.  Wedowee soils lack a high content of mica."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hulett soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping Piedmont uplands.  The soils formed in material weathered from acid metamorphic rocks, chiefly graphitic schists, slates, and quartzite.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F."

Louisa soils have discontinuous Bt horizons and Tallapoosa soils have Bt horizons less than 10 inches thick."
