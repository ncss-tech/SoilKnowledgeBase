The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for a Hayner pedon (S60 (61) NMEX-7-5) adjacent to the typical pedon are on pages 802-805 in Gile, L.H. and R.B.
