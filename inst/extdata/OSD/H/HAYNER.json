  "OVERVIEW": "The Hayner series consists of moderately deep to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from rhyolite.  Hayner soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants with slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 58 degrees F.",

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for a Hayner pedon (S60 (61) NMEX-7-5) adjacent to the typical pedon are on pages 802-805 in Gile, L.H. and R.B.
