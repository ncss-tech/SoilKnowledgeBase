  "OVERVIEW": "The Hammersley series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum primarily from pyroclastic rocks.  Hammersley soils are on mountainsides with slopes of 15 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
