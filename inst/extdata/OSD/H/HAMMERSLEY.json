The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 30 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 25 percent rock fragments.  It has 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 when moist and 4 or 5 when dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 when moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 when moist and 4 or 5 when dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 when moist and dry.  It is clay loam and clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent cobbles and stones and 5 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 when dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 when moist and dry.  It is clay and clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 30 percent cobbles and stones and 5 to 15 percent gravel."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered primarily from pyroclastic rocks.  The climate is cold and moist in winters and cool and dry in summers.  The annual precipitation is 30 to 34 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 20 to 50 days."
