  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Agar, Eakin, Fairlo, Highmore, Monticello, Northdale, and Paka series.  Agar and Highmore soils typically contain free carbonates in the lower part of the solum and have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 50 degrees F.  In addition, the Highmore soils are stratified in the lower part, having formed in silty glacial drift.  Eakin soils contain free carbonates within a depth of 18 inches and in addition, are underlain by loamy till within a depth of 20 to 38 inches.  Fairlo soils have clayey textures within a depth of 40 inches.  Monticello and Northdale soils have redder hue.  Paka soils have soft siltstone at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in calcareous loess.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Butler, Coly, Crete, Fillmore, Hall, Harney, Kenesaw, Scott and Uly soils.  Butler soils are in slight depressions and have a fine textured argillic horizon.  Coly soils lack a mollic epipedon and typically are on steep side slopes.  Crete and Harney soils are on similar topographic positions but have fine textured argillic horizons.  In addition, Crete soils have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Fillmore and Scott soils are in shallow depressions within areas of Holdrege soils.  Hall soils are in slightly lower areas and have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Kenesaw soils lack an argillic horizon and have a coarse-silty control section.  Uly soils lack an argillic horizon, are shallower to free carbonates and commonly are on steeper slopes below the Holdrege soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Severely eroded Holdrege soils will no longer classify as Mollisols and will need to be recorrelated to a new series.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 inches (Ap, a and Bt1 horizon); argillic horizon--the zone from 12 to 24 inche4s (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons) and typic-ustic moisture regime. A sandy overblown phase is recognized.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The Holdrege pedon described in Soil Survey Investigations Report  number 5, pp.. 72 to 75 is from the same general area as the typical pedon described here.\nOSD Modification: RRZ07/2002;\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
