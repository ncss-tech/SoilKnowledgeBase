  "OVERVIEW": "The Hagerman series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium and eolian material derived from sandstone and shale on hills, piedmont fans, mesas and ridgetops.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
