Briedwell soils average 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have an average annual soil temperature of 50 to 53 degrees F. Fivelakes soils do not have an O horizon, are neutral throughout and dry 90 to 105 days. Lyville soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact and dry 90 to 105 days. Mowako soils average 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Rockford soils average 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Spokel soils are dry 45 to 65 days and are dominated by greater than 60 percent angular granitic gravel size fragments in the particle-size control section and have no stratification of textures in the substratum within 60 inches. Suta soils average 18 to 23 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact."
