  "OVERVIEW": "The Huston series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in alluvium from igneous rocks. Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent in canyons and mountain valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
