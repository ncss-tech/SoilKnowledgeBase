The soils occur on flood plains and formed in alluvium derived mainly from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. The climate is semiarid, the average annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches (279 to 406 mm). The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F (3.9 to 7.2 degrees C), and the freeze-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Jodero soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth. Krueger soils lack a histic epipedon and have an argillic horizon.  All are well drained and have mollic epipedons."
