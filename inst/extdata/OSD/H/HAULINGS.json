  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Haulings series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. Haulings soils occur on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches (305 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F (6.7 degrees C).",
