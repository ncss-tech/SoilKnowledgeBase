These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 15 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F).
