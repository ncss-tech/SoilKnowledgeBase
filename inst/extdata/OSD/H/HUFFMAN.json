  "OVERVIEW": "The Huffman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium and loess.  Huffman soils are on hills and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
