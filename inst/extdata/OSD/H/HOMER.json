  "STATES": "IN,NY,OH",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Homer series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and gravelly outwash over stratified, calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash on outwash plains, terraces, and valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

Series in closely related families are the Angola, Appleton, Ayrshire, Burdett, Crosby, Darien, Digby, Haskins, Jimtown, Kibbie, Macomb, Matherton, Ruark, Sleeth, and Whitaker series. All the above soils except Matherton lack contrasting textures of calcareous sand and gravel at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches). Matherton soils have surface horizons with moist color value of 3 or less and value of 5 or less when dry."
