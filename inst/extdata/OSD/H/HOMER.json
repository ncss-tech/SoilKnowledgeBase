    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Series in closely related families are the Angola, Appleton, Ayrshire, Burdett, Crosby, Darien, Digby, Haskins, Jimtown, Kibbie, Macomb, Matherton, Ruark, Sleeth, and Whitaker series. All the above soils except Matherton lack contrasting textures of calcareous sand and gravel at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches). Matherton soils have surface horizons with moist color value of 3 or less and value of 5 or less when dry."

Homer soils formed in loamy and gravelly outwash over stratified, calcareous sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

Homer soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Fox and Kosciusko soils on higher landform positions and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Sebewa soils in lower depressions and drainageways. The well drained Ockley soils have a thicker solum and are on higher landform positions. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Westland soils have a thicker solum and are in low depressions and drainageways."

Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material."
