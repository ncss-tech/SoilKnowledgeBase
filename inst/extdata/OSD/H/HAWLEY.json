  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hawley series consist of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. They formed in material weathered from loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on high flood plains subject to rare flooding, in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 838 mm (33 in), and mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (63 degrees F)",
