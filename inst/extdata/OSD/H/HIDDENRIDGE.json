  "OVERVIEW": "The Hiddenridge series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in glacial drift mixed with colluvium from metasedimentary bedrock. Hiddenridge soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes at elevations near sea level to 2,200 feet. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Series with similar classification but mixed mineralogy include the Airstrip, Coyata, Decy, Musty, Tyson, Wyeth, and Zeibright soils. Airstrip, Coyata, Decy, Masterson, Musty, and Tyson soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Fiddletown soils have a paralithic contact at 24 and 48 inches. Wyeth soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Zeibright soils have a frost-free period of 100 to 150 days."

Doebay soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches, an ochric epipedon, and generally occur under a denser forest canopy on northerly slopes. Haro soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches and a mollic epipedon. Turtleback soils have an ochric epipedon and a cambic horizon."

The typical pedon is over 20 inches thick thus Pachic subgroup.  The series was orginally classified as Humic Dystroxerepts.\nADDITIONAL DATA: One reference pedon sampled at the type location, NSSL pedon # 03N0238, NASIS user pedon ID 02WA-055-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
