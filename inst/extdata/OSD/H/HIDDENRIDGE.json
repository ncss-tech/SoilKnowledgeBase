Series with similar classification but mixed mineralogy include the Airstrip, Coyata, Decy, Musty, Tyson, Wyeth, and Zeibright soils. Airstrip, Coyata, Decy, Masterson, Musty, and Tyson soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Fiddletown soils have a paralithic contact at 24 and 48 inches. Wyeth soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Zeibright soils have a frost-free period of 100 to 150 days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hiddenridge soils are on south-facing hillslopes and mountain slopes with slopes of 8 to 75 percent and elevations from 0 to 2,200 feet. These soils formed in glacial drift mixed with colluvium from metasedimentary bedrock. The maritime climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 35 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 200 to 240 days."

Cady soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches, an ochric epipedon, and generally occur under a denser forest canopy on northerly slopes. Doebay soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches, an ochric epipedon, and generally occur under a denser forest canopy on northerly slopes. Haro soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches and a mollic epipedon. Turtleback soils have an ochric epipedon and a cambic horizon."

The typical pedon is over 20 inches thick thus Pachic subgroup.  The series was orginally classified as Humic Dystroxerepts.\nADDITIONAL DATA: One reference pedon sampled at the type location, NSSL pedon # 03N0238, NASIS user pedon ID 02WA-055-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
