    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hoxoh soils are on summits and shoulders of interfluves on undulating plateaus. They formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived locally from Quaternary Age rhyolitic tuff. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 7,600 to 8,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."

Cajete soils are ashy-pumiceous, are very deep, and occur on north-facing backslopes of undulating plateaus.  Cymery soils are ashy-skeletal, do not have mollic epipedons, and are on summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus.  Jemez soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and are on summits and shoulders of interfluves.  Tschicoma soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on footslopes and toeslopes of interfluves."
