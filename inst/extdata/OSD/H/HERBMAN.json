Native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, Parry oatgrass, blue grama, fringed sagebrush, mountain mahogany, Idaho fescue, pine dropseed, and common juniper. These soils are estimated to be in a Douglas-fir/Arizona fescue or ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir/mountain muhly plant association. A nonforested grassland plant community is no longer considered part of the series concept."

S82 CO-119-003.\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
