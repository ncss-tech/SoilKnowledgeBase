  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Herbman series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from granitic rock, schist, or gneiss.  These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges with most commonly south and west aspect.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Native vegetation is mainly Douglas-fir, ponderosa pine, Arizona fescue, mountain muhly, Parry oatgrass, blue grama, fringed sagebrush, mountain mahogany, Idaho fescue, pine dropseed, and common juniper. These soils are estimated to be in a Douglas-fir/Arizona fescue or ponderosa pine-Douglas-fir/mountain muhly plant association. A nonforested grassland plant community is no longer considered part of the series concept."

S82 CO-119-003.\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
