These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 12 and 35 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  The particle-size control section is 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is 5 to 15 percent pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is gravely sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly coarse sandy loam.  It is 20 to 35 percent pebbles and 5 to 10 percent cobbles. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, or is multicolored.  It is extremely gravelly sand, extremely gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly coarse sand, extremely cobbly sand or extremely cobbly coarse sand.  It is 40 to 60 percent pebbles and 15 to 30 percent cobbles.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

Narcisse soils are coarse-loamy and have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Republic soils are coarse-loamy, have a mollic epipedon and are frigid.  Springdale and Spens soils lack a volcanic ash mantle. Spokane soils are coarse-loamy, have a mollic epipedon and have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Vanbrunt soils are loamy-skeletal, have a mollic epipedon, and have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."
