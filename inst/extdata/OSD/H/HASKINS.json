    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the somewhat poorly drained Aurand, very poorly drained Mermill, and moderately well drained Houcktown and Rawson soils that comprise a toposequence with the Haskins soils. Aurand soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscape positions. Mermill soils are on flats or in depressions, and the Houcktown and Rawson soils are on higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained, clayey Hoytville and Latty soils are on nearby planar landscapes."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy material and moderately low or low in the underlying till. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and slow or very slow in the underlying till."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, BEg) horizon.\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 96 cm (Btg, Bt, B'tg horizons).\nDensic contact: at 132 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 23 cm.\nThe previous Haskins series concept allowed for fine-textured lacustrine sediments in the 2B and 2Cd horizons. A new series will be established during modernization projects in MLRA 99 to define these soils.\nAn evaluation of existing lab data supports the redefinition of clay content in the till. Further evaluation for densic materials is needed to better define the series concept.\nThe addition of the densic contact is based on data from associated soils. More supporting bulk density data is needed.\nThe sandy surface phase correlated in an earlier survey does not meet the series concept. A new series will be established during modernization projects in MLRA 99 to define these soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 129997 in MO 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
