  "OVERVIEW": "The Haskins series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to dense till. They formed in loamy water-sorted or glaciolacustrine material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and in the underlying till. These soils are on lake plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

A new series will be established during modernization projects in MLRA 99 to define these soils.\nAn evaluation of existing lab data supports the redefinition of clay content in the till. Further evaluation for densic materials is needed to better define the series concept.\nThe addition of the densic contact is based on data from associated soils. More supporting bulk density data is needed.\nThe sandy surface phase correlated in an earlier survey does not meet the series concept. A new series will be established during modernization projects in MLRA 99 to define these soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Representative data mapunit is DMU ID 129997 in MO 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
