  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is about 14 to 38 inches and the soil is about 20 to 40 inches deep to basic metavolcanic bedrock. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F.  Mineralogy is mixed and the soils are dry most years for more than 60 consecutive days during the summer.  The A horizon colors are in 5YR and 7.5YR hues and have values of 4 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  Chromas are 2 dry or moist.  Texture ranges from heavy loam to light clay loam.  Structure is moderate to weak granular, consistence is slightly hard to hard, friable, and slightly sticky and slightly plastic.  Reaction is slightly acid.  The B2 horizon colors are in the 7.5YR hue with values of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  Chromas are 2 or 3.  Texture ranges from light clay loam to clay loam and structure from weak or moderate subangular blocky to moderate granular.  Consistence is hard, friable to firm and slightly plastic and slightly sticky to plastic and sticky.  Reaction generally is medium acid."

The Kerby soils have dark brown A horizons, loam textured B2 horizons and lack R layers.  The Laughlin soils have brown A horizons and strongly acid B2 horizons.  The Barron soils are very deep, have dark grayish brown A horizons, and sandy loam B2 horizons.  The Madonna soils have pale brown A horizons and medium and strongly acid B2 horizons.  The Masterson soils have brown, strongly acid A horizons and very strongly acid B2 horizons.  The McCarthy soils have brown and dark brown A horizons and gravelly sandy loam B2 horizons.  The Morical soils have pale brown mildly alkaline B2 horizons.  The Neuns soils have dark brown A horizons and yellowish brown medium and strongly acid B2 horizons."

The climate is mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 35 to 55 inches, with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 to 54 degrees F., the average January temperature about 39 degrees F., and average July temperature about 70 degrees F."
