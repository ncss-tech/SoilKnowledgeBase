The 10- to 40-inch control\nsection averages moderately coarse texture and has less than 18 percent\nclay (mostly less than 12) and less than 35 percent rock fragments.\nBelow a depth of 10 inches and to a depth of 25 inches or more, the\ndominant texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or\ngravelly sandy loam containing more than 50 percent fine sand or\ncoarser.  A layer of loose sand and gravel or very gravelly loamy sand\nhas its upper boundary between depths of 24 and 40 inches.  The organic\nmatter content decreases irregularly with increasing depth and reaches\nlevels 0.2 to 0.35 percent within a depth of 50 inches.  Reaction is\nmildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3\nthrough 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is too thin or has too little\norganic matter to be a mollic epipedon.\nThe C horizon has color like the A horizon and also includes higher\nvalue and chroma."

The alluvium is\ndominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources with lesser\ninfluence from rhyolite, basaltic, and granitic materials.  The climate\nis semiarid with dry summers and has a mean annual precipitation of 8\nto 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees to 45\ndegrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 126 days."
