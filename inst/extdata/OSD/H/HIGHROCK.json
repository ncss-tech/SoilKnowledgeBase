  "OVERVIEW": "The Highrock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Highrock soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
