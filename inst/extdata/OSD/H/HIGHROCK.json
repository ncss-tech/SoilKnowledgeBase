  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Highrock soils are on lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from basalt over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Small hummocks of eolian sand occur around bases of large shrubs.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 4,050 feet.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches, mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
