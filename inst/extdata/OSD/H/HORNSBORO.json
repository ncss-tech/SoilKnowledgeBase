Wahee soils do not have more than 35 percent base saturation at 50 inches below the upper boundary of the Bt horizon and also lack the presence of soluble salts.  The December 2025 revision clarified the directions to the type location.  Type location was not moved.  The format was also updated.  No data was changed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (Ap and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 157 centimeters (10 to 62 inches) below the surface (Btg, Bt1, Bt2, and B'tg horizons)\nNatric horizon--the zone from 25 to 157 centimeters (10 to 62 inches) below the surface (Btg, Bt1, Bt2, and B'tg horizons)"
