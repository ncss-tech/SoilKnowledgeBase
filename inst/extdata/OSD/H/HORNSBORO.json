The moderately well drained Altavista and Tetotum soils have a loamy subsoil and are on slightly higher areas. The Augusta soils have a loamy subsoil and are on similar landscape positions. The Chewacla soils have a loamy subsoil and are on nearby flood plains. The poorly drained Roanoke soils are on slightly lower areas. The Wahee soils are on similar landscapes but lack the soluble salts. The well drained Wickham soils have a loamy subsoil and are on knolls and slightly higher areas."
