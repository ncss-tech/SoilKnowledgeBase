  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Helphenstein soils are on lake terraces and lakebeds. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from tuff and basalt with thin surface mantles of eolian sand. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,265 to 1,465 meters. The climate is arid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

Mesman and Turpin soils are well drained and do not have water tables. Mesman soils have natric horizons. Reese soils have an aquic moisture regime."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 30 and 100 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) between February and April. Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory. Some phases of these soils are susceptible to occasional or frequent ponding for long duration from December through May with water up to 30 cm deep."
