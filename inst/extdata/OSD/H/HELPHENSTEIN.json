  "OVERVIEW": "The Helphenstein series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from tuff and basalt with thin surface mantles of eolian sand. Helphenstein soils are on lake terraces and lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
