  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 78 degrees F.  Organic carbon ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 percent in the surface horizon but decreases irregularly with depth.  The particle-size control section is stratified with strata ranging from sandy loam to clay loam, but averaging approximately loam.  On a weighted average basis, clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 10 to 50 percent, and sand from 20 to 60 percent with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments are generally less that 5 percent and range from 0 to 20 percent.  Some visible calcium carbonate may occur at any depth in these soils, but it is not concentrated into any consistent horizon of accumulation.  This soil is not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than one-half the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  (195 to 210 days) and is not dry for 45 consecutive days following July 15.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  When the value of the surface horizon is as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist, the horizon is thin enough so that if mixed to 7 inches it is too light colored or contains too little organic carbon to qualify as a mollic epipedon or are finely stratified.  The A horizon usually has granular primary structure but it has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  It has from less-than-one to about 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent, which differs erratically from stratum to stratum."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aparejo, Hickman, Hysham, Ramper and Rockypoint series (it is assumed Hickman soils are competing pending and update of the classification).  Aparejo, Hickman and Ramper soils are driest during May and June in the moisture control section.  In addition Aparejo soils have hues of 5YR and redder.  Hysham soils have very strongly alkaline surface horizons and typically have Bt horizons with columnar structure.  Rockypoint soils are dry from July through September."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Haverson soils are on floodplains and low terraces of major rivers.  Slope is 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in highly stratified, calcareous, recent alluvium derived from mixed sources.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the early spring and summer.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 77 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 125 to 180 days."
