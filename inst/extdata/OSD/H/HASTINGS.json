  "OVERVIEW": "The Hastings series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess.  Hastings soils are on interfluves and hillslopes on loess uplands in the Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75.  Slopes range from 0 to 17 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 711 millimeters (28 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Edited mollic thickness in RIC to not be pachic. Added in depth to argillic. Added in clay content and sand content for each horizon. For BC horizon changed reaction from slightly acid to slightly alkaline to neutral to moderately alkaline (based on lab data). For C horizon changed mottles to relict redoximorphic features.\nUpdated competing series to include Lasita.\nAdded elevation and FFD to geographic setting and updated landform.\nDeleted Holder and Hall from geographically associated soils because don't occur near type location.  Updated the others.\nAdded LRR and MLRA to distribution and extent.\nAdded additional pedons with NSSL characterization data to additional data.\nOSD Modification 8/2012 DJK Lowered the depth to carbonates from 91 cm to 80. Added mean annual soil temperature range to RIC. Raised the sand content for the Ap horizon from 15 to 18 percent. Lowered the lower clay content for the Ap from 23 to 21 and raised the upper from 32 to 34 percent. Raised the upper clay content for the BA horizon from 38 to 39 percent. Lowered sand content for the BC horizon from 27 to 24 percent. Added silt loam as possible texture for BC horizon. In RIC, added CCE for the BC and C horizons and added statement about now being Bk horizons. Added precipitation pattern and changed MAP to 26 to 32 inches in the geographic setting. Deleted Massie from geographically associated soils. Changed runoff to include negligible."
