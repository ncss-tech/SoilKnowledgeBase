  "OVERVIEW": "The Hontoon series consists of deep, very poorly drained, organic soils that formed in more than 130 centimeters (51 inches) of well decomposed, hydrophytic, herbaceous plant remains. Hontoon soils are in depressions, freshwater marshes, swamps and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1300 millimeters (51 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
