  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 degrees to about 53 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but they are dry in some part between 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 60 cumulative days. The particle-size control section averages more than 50 percent coarse fragments. The soil ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid.  Depth to the strongly cemented till, ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or redder and ranges in value and chroma from 3 to 5. It has weak granular or blocky structure.\nThe BC horizon has 7.5YR or 10YR hue and ranges in value and chroma from 3 through 5. It is mostly very gravelly sandy loam but may contain thin subhorizons of very gravelly loamy sand. It is massive or single grained.\nThe 2Bqm horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue and value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2."

Ahl, Beausite, Cathcart, Everett, Olete, and Copalis soils lack compact till or bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Alderwood and Sinclair soils have A1 horizons, Bir horizons of 7.5YR or 10YR hue, and weakly cemented IIC horizons. Dabob soils have A2 horizons, Bir horizons of 7.5YR hue, and weakly cemented IIC horizons.  Klaus soils appear to have coarse textures by field determination.  Triton soils have very gravelly loam Bir horizons and the depth to the firm IIC horizon is less than 20 inches. Whidbey soils have 7.5YR or 10YR hues in the Bir horizons and weakly cemented IIC horizons. Shelton soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hoodsport soils are on rolling to hilly glaciated uplands at elevations from sea level to 500 feet. They are in a mild marine climate; summer is dry and cool and most of the precipitation falls as rain in the late autumn, winter, and early spring. They formed in noncemented glacial till underlain by strongly cemented basal till.  Mean January temperature is 40 degrees F.; mean July air temperature is 60 degrees F.; and a mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 65 inches. The 28 degrees F.  f.eeze-free season is 216 days and the 32 degrees F. freeze-free season is 161 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  A great group of Durixerands should be proposed for this and other Xerands with cemented layers.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 6 inches, a cambic horizon from 6 to 28 inches, and a duripan at 28 to 32 inches.  The pan needs further study as to the nature of the cementing agent.  Laboratory data on Hoko series indicates the cement is iron, aluminum, and organic matter.  This would make the horizon ortstein rather than a duripan.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
