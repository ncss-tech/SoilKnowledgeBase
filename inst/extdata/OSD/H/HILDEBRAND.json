  "OVERVIEW": "The Hildebrand series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium with a thin volcanic ash mantle. They are on stream terraces.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
