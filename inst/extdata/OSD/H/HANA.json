  "OVERVIEW": "The Hana series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash over cinders and `a`a lava.  Hana soils are on uplands and have slopes of 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 115 inches and mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.",
