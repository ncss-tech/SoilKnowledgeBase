    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to calcareous soil ranges from 36 to more\nthan 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon is brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/2, 4/4; 10YR 5/3, 4/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2,\n4/4), and dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  It is loam or fine\nsandy loam with clay content of 10 to 16 percent.  It is neutral\nor mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is reddish brown (5YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/4), yellowish\nred (5YR 5/6), brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), reddish yellow (7.5YR\n6/5), dark brown (7.5YR 4/2, 4/4), or light brown (7.5YR 6/4).\nClay content ranges from 21 to 33 percent.  It has weak or\nmoderate, fine to coarse prismatic and weak or moderate, fine or medium blocky or subangular blocky structure, and is neutral or mildly alkaline in the upper part and moderately alkaline in the lower part.  The BC horizon is pinkish gray (5YR 7/2, 6/2; 7.5YR\n7/2, 6/2), pink (5YR 7/3, 7/4; 7.5YR 7/4), or reddish yellow\n(7.5YR 7/6).  Fine to medium splotches and streaks of uncoated\nsand grains range from none to common.  When the matrix has\ndominant chromas of 4 or less, there are common to many distinct reddish and yellowish mottles with chromas of 6 or 8.  The\ncalcium carbonate equivalent in the BC and C horizons is 3 to 10 percent and remains relatively constant with depth.\nThe C horizon is pinkish gray (5YR 7/2, 6/2; 7.5YR 7/2, 6/2),\npink (5YR 7/3, 7/4; 7.5YR 7/4), or reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6).  Weakly cemented fragments of sandstone range from 0 to 15 percent\nby volume below 60 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known soils in the same\nfamily.  Similar soils are Brennan, Delfina, Cuero, Duval, and Willacy series.  Brennan, Delfina, and Duval soils lack mollic epipedons.  Cuero soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  Delfina soils have mottles due to wetness in the upper Bt horizon.  Duval and Willacy soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  In addition, Willacy soils have hues of 10YR throughout."

The soil formed in\nloamy sediments 10 feet or more thick.  The climate is dry\nsubhumid.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 34\ninches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 72 to 74\ndegrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 28 to 36."
