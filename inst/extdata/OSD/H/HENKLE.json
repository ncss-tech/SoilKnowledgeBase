  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are intermittently moist and are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 90 to 110 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The solum contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  Reaction is neutral throughout.  Phosphate retention is 40 to 70 percent.  The acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate extractable iron is 0.40 to 1.0 percent.  Field estimated clay content is 5 to 20 percent throughout.  Reaction is neutral in the upper part and neutral to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 60 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent stones.  It contains a total of 15 to 80 percent rock fragments.  The fine-earth texture is ashy sandy loam, ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loam or ashy loamy sand.  Organic matter content is typically less than 1 percent below a depth of 12 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon, when present, has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It has 40 to 75 percent rock fragments of which 5 to 20 are gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles, 5 to 30 percent stones and 15 to 45 percent boulders.  The fine-earth texture is ashy loam, or ashy sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, when present, has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The fine-earth texture is ashy loamy sand or ashy loamy coarse sand and contains 0 to 10 percent stones, and 50 to 70 percent cobbles."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over bedrock.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 20 to 90 days."
