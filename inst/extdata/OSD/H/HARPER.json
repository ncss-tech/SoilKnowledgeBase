  "OVERVIEW": "The Harper series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum over limestone bedrock.  These nearly level to steep soils formed in residuum derived from limestone and occur on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 in).",
