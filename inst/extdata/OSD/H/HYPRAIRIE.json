The 60 to 75 dry days of the Hyprairie soils may be too low; it may be 60 to 90 days or even 75 to 90 days. The Hyprairie soils in the high elevation phase appear to be similar to the Yaxing soils in MLRA 6 that are underlain by sandstone.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--characterization number S82WA-039-3\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
