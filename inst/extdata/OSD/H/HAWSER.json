  "OVERVIEW": "The Hawser series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from sandstone and shale. Hawser soils are on dissected fluviomarine terraces. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches (660 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
