  "OVERVIEW": "The Hornell series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till overlying shale or siltstone. They are nearly level to steep soils on bedrock-controlled uplands. Permeability is slow or very slow. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 17 to 40 inches. Depth to lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent, by volume, in the A horizon; 1 to 35 percent in the B horizon; and 10 to 60 percent in the C horizon. Rock fragments are dominantly channers or flagstones of shale or siltstone.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It has granular or subangular blocky structure and very friable to firm consistence. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 1 through 3, and have redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay . Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or it is platy. Consistence ranges from friable to firm.\nThe Bw or Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Chroma of 1 is allowed in the lower part. Faces of peds are chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction. It has subangular blocky or angular blocky structure which is within coarse or very coarse prisms in many pedons. Consistence is friable to very firm. Ped interiors have distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC or 2BC horizon, which has prismatic structure and is massive or platy within the prisms.\nThe C or 2Cr horizon, where present, is similar in color and texture to the B horizon, but the material is massive, or has plate-like divisions inherited from the rock structure. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe R or 2R horizon is shale or siltstone bedrock that weathers readily in the upper part, and can be cut easily with handtools in the upper few inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

Allis soils have chroma of 0 to 2 dominant in the matrix of all or subhorizons of the B horizon. Hornellsville soils have frigid temperature regimes, and Kanona soils lack bedrock within a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hornell soils are nearly level to steep soils on uplands. Slope gradients range from 0 to 50 percent. These soils formed in till or till and residuum. The till forms a moderately thick mantle, 20 to 40 inches deep, over acid shale or siltstone bedrock. The till mantle is derived from material like the underlying bedrock. In some places the shale bedrock has weathered and part of the soil mantle is residuum. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 45 inches, and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 140 to 170 days. The elevation ranges from 600 to 1800 feet above sea level."

The Hornellsville soils are at adjacent higher elevations and have a frigid temperature regime."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The concept of the Hornell series has been changed to exclude moderately well drained soils. It is believed that the moderately well drained segment lacks an Aquic moisture regime and therefore are not Aquepts. The classification of Hornell was changed to Endoaquepts to comply with 8th Edition of Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and other feature recognized in the typical pedon are:\n(1) Ochric Epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n(2) Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 35 inches (Bw horizons)\n(3) Aquic moisture regime - as evidenced by redoximorphic features and low chromas ped faces below the surface layer (Bw1 horizon).\n(4) Aeric subgroup - the zone from 8 to 30 inches, matrix colors with hues 10YR or yellower, and values, moist, and chromas 3 or greater (Bw horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for pedon S73NY049-11 from the Cornell University soil survey laboratory.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
