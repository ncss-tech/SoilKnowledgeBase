The mean annual summer soil temperature is 53 to 56 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry less then 45 consecutive days between 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments. Depth to the consolidated gravelly layer is 40 to 70 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has few to common prominent redox concentrations with hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 dry.  It has many prominent redox concentrations with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam and clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel.  It is strongly to very strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 moist and dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.
