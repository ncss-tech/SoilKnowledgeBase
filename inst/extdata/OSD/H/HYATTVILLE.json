  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hyattville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered principally from interbedded shale, sandstone, and limestone.  Hyattville soils are on mountain sides and have slopes of 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
