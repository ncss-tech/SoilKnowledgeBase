Rock fragments more than 3 inches in diameter range from 10 to 50 percent.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Matrix texture is loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and is modified by rock fragments.  This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 14 percent.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
