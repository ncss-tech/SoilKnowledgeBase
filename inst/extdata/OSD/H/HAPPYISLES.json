    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Happyisles soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons, flood plains, terraces and drainageways of mountain valleys. Slope is 0 to 9 percent. These soils formed primarily in alluvium and minor amounts of colluvium derived from granitoid rock. Elevation is 3,870 to 5,431 feet (1,179.6 to 1,655.3 meters). The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 31 to 43 inches (787 to 1,092 millimeters), some of which falls as snow. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F (10 to 13 degrees C). The mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F (2.2 degrees C). The mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F (22.2 degrees C). The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
