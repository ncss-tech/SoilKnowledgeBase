  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Happyisles series consists of very deep, well drained or somewhat poorly drained soils formed primarily in alluvium and minor amounts of colluvium derived from granitoid rock. Happyisles soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons, flood plains, terraces, and drainageways of mountain valleys. Slope is 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches (864 millimeters). The mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F (12.2 degrees C).",
