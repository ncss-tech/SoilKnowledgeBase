The soil between 6 and 18 inches is moist throughout from November 15 to June 1 and dry throughout from July 1 to October 15 in most years.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments are 0 to 10 percent gravel and cobbles, 2 to 15 cm in size, throughout.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline above the paralithic contact.  Base saturation is over 75 percent.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/4; 10YR 5/3, 5/4 or 6/3.  Moist colors are 5YR 4/4, 4/2; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/4; 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/4.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent  and has less than 1.2 times clay increase within the horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5YR 5/4; 5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 5/4 or 5/6.

Clay content is 35 to 50 percent and is always 15 percent (absolute) more than the A horizon.\nThe C horizon is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay content."

These soils formed in material weathered from basic volcanic rocks of the Quien Sabe formation.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 24 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 44 degree F; mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F and the mean annual temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly mapped as Rough Stony Land in the Los Banos Area, Series 1939 report.  They are being differentiated by being moderately deep, lacking stones and having a grass cover.  pH determined by colormetic method using Hellige-Troug Triplex indicators.  Base saturation determined by sum of the cations method using KC1-triethanolamine extract.  Texture determined by modified boayucos hydrometer method.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-black digestion method.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HCl.\nCEC/Clay ratio estimated from similar soils with laboratory data in the W. Stanislaus Soil Survey Area.\nRapid or very rapid runoff terminology adjusted 4/96 to very high new adjective criteria of the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93\nLast review and transmission of file 5/98.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
