The soil between 6 and 18 inches is moist throughout from November 15 to June 1 and dry throughout from July 1 to October 15 in most years.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments are 0 to 10 percent gravel and cobbles, 2 to 15 cm in size, throughout.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline above the paralithic contact.  Base saturation is over 75 percent.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/4; 10YR 5/3, 5/4 or 6/3.  Moist colors are 5YR 4/4, 4/2; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/4; 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/4.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent  and has less than 1.2 times clay increase within the horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5YR 5/4; 5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 5/4 or 5/6.

Clay content is 35 to 50 percent and is always 15 percent (absolute) more than the A horizon.\nThe C horizon is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay content."

They are being differentiated by being moderately deep, lacking stones and having a grass cover.  pH determined by colormetic method using Hellige-Troug Triplex indicators.  Base saturation determined by sum of the cations method using KC1-triethanolamine extract.  Texture determined by modified boayucos hydrometer method.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-black digestion method.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HCl.\nCEC/Clay ratio estimated from similar soils with laboratory data in the W. Stanislaus Soil Survey Area.\nRapid or very rapid runoff terminology adjusted 4/96 to very high new adjective criteria of the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93\nLast review and transmission of file 5/98.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
