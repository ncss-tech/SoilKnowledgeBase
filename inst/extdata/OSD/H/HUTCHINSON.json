  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 or more consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 25 percent pebbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has weak to moderate prismatic or moderate to strong subangular blocky structure.  Clay films are common thin to continuous thick.  The duripan is weakly cemented to strongly cemented and less than one-half of the upper boundary is undurated or has a laminar capping.  There are 15 to 35 percent pebbles in this horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has 30 to 50 percent pebbles and 15 to 40 percent cobbles."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bailing and Bedner series.  The Bailing soils lack coarse fragments in the duripan and lack any influence from volcanic ash.  Bedner soils lack a silt loam layer above the B2t horizon, and 4 to 10 inches deep to the top of the B2t horizon and lack rock fragments throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hutchinson soils are on terraces at elevations of 3,400 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in loess, volcanic ash, colluvium and mixed alluvium.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cool wet winters.  The average annual temperature is 12 to 16 inches.  The average January temperature is 24 to 28 degrees F.  The average July temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."

Coughanour soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Kilmerque soils are medium textured and lack an argillic horizon and a duripan.  Ladd soils have a weak argillic horizon and lack a duripan."
