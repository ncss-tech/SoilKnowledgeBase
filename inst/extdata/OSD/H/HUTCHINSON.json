  "OVERVIEW": "The Hutchinson series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess, volcanic ash, colluvium, and mixed alluvium.  Hutchinson soils are on old terraces and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 or more consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 25 percent pebbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has weak to moderate prismatic or moderate to strong subangular blocky structure.  Clay films are common thin to continuous thick.  The duripan is weakly cemented to strongly cemented and less than one-half of the upper boundary is undurated or has a laminar capping.  There are 15 to 35 percent pebbles in this horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has 30 to 50 percent pebbles and 15 to 40 percent cobbles."
