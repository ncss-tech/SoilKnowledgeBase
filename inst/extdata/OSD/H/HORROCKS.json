  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Horrocks soils are on moderately sloping to very steep dominantly south and west facing mountain slopes and terminal moraines at elevations of 5,300 to 9,290 feet (1,615 to 2,830 meters).  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in glacial deposits, residuum, slope alluvium and colluvium from andesite, dacite, basalt, tuff and some conglomerate, sandstone, limestone and quartzite.  The climate is moist subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 27 inches (406 to 686 mm) falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F. (1.7 to 7.2 degrees C.), and the mean summer temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F. (15.6 to 17.2 degrees C.) Freeze-free period is 60 to 100 days."

Broadhead and Henefer soils have clay argillic horizons that contain less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Condie soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Geertsen soils have mean summer temperature less than 59 degrees F (15 degrees C).  Little Pole soils are 10 to 20 inches deep (25 to 50 cm) over bedrock.  Yeates Hollow soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the fine particle-size control section."
