  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Horrocks series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial deposits, slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum from andesite, dacite, basalt, tuff, sandstone and quartzite.  These soils are on mountain slopes and terminal moraines.  Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F. (4.4 degrees C.), and the mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches (559 mm).",

Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in glacial deposits, residuum, slope alluvium and colluvium from andesite, dacite, basalt, tuff and some conglomerate, sandstone, limestone and quartzite.  The climate is moist subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 27 inches (406 to 686 mm) falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F. (1.7 to 7.2 degrees C.), and the mean summer temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F. (15.6 to 17.2 degrees C.) Freeze-free period is 60 to 100 days."

Geertsen soils have mean summer temperature less than 59 degrees F (15 degrees C).  Little Pole soils are 10 to 20 inches deep (25 to 50 cm) over bedrock.
