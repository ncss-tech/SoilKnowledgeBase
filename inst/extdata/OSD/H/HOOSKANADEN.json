  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section is 40 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments. Depth to bedrock is typically 60 inches or more.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 30 to 50 inches.  The solum is very strongly or strongly acid.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent gravel, 1 to 2 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 iron, and 60 to 85 percent P-retention.  Organic matter is 8 to 12 percent.  Moist bulk density is 0.90 to 1.0 g/cc.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and 1 to 3 dry. Many medium distinct or prominent redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and redox concentrations as masses of iron and manganese occur throughout this horizon.  It is silty clay or clay with 40 to 50 percent clay and has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Organic matter is 2 to 4 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 to 8 dry and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and 2 to 4 dry.    Many medium or coarse prominent redox concentrations as masses of iron and manganese occur throughout this horizon.  It is clay or silty clay with 40 to 60 percent clay and has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hooskanaden soils occur in concave areas of open grasslands on metastable ridgetops and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from highly sheared and weathered metasedimentary rock types of the Otter Point Formation.  Elevations are 200 to 1300 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 270 days."

Millicoma soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and are loamy-skeletal.  Reedsport soils are fine-loamy, well drained, 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, and are on ridgetops and side slopes.  Reinhart soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact, lack an argillic horizon, and are in grassland areas on ridgetops and side slopes.  Sebastian soils are loamy-skeletal, 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact, have serpentinitic mineralogy, and are on ridgetops and side slopes.  Whaleshead soils are loamy-skeletal and are on side slopes."
