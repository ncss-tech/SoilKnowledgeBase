  "OVERVIEW": "The Hellforsure series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from schist and metasedimentary rocks. The Hellforsure soils are mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1175 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 0 degrees C.",
