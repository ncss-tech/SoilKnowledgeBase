The mean annual soil temperature is about 74 degrees F.  The soil is dry in some horizon for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, moist value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, but the buried B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR.  This horizon has dry value of 3 or 4 and moist or dry chroma of 2 through 6.  Structural grade ranges from weak to moderate in the B horizon."

These soils formed in basic igneous material influenced by volcanic ash.  The annual rainfall is about 15 to 20 inches, most of which occurs between April and November.  The average January temperature is about 71 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 77 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F."
