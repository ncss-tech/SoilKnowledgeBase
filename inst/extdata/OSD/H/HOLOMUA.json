  "OVERVIEW": "The Holomua series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic igneous rock influenced by volcanic ash.  Holomua soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F.",
