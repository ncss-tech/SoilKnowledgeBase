  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 60 to 75 percent.  Slickensides and wedge-shaped aggregates begin at depths ranging from 20 to 30 inches below the surface.  Cracks remain open from 150 to 210 cumulative days in most years.  Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microhighs 2 to 6 inches higher than microlows.  Distance from center of the microhigh to the center of the microlow ranges from 5 to 10 feet.  Soil salinity usually increases with depth and ranges from 16 to 20 dS/m in the lower part of the pedon.  Exchangeable sodium precentage (ESP) increases with depth and ranges from about 6 in the A horizons to about 25 in the Bnss2 horizon.  However, ESP ranges from 16 to 20 within 40 inches of the surface.  Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has color in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 5 or 6, and chroma 2 or 3.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Moist values are about 1 unit less than dry values.\nThe Bss horizons has color with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 5 or 6, and chroma 2 or 3.  Texture is clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are Cotulla, Lattas, LaSalle, and Mercedes.  All of these soils have a fine particle-size control section.  Cotulla and LaSalle soils are in drier climates.  Lattas soils have ESP less than 16 at 40 inches below the surface.  Mercedes, and also Lattas soils, have chroma less than 1.5 in the upper 12 inches."

The soil formed in calcareous clayey alluvial sediments many feet thick.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 25 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 73 to 74 degrees F.  Elevation is 20 to 120 feet.  Frost free days range from 325 to 345 days.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 22 to about 34."

Benito soils have grayer colors with chroma less than 1.5 in the upper 50 inches.  Cameron soils have clayey over loamy texture control sections.  Laredo soils have fine-silty texture control sections.  Lomalta soils have grayish colors associated with wetness.  Olmito soils do not have slickensides."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly used for irrigated cropland except in areas near the coast that are saline.  Crops grown are cotton, grain sorghum, and a wide variety of cool season vegetables.  In pasture the main grasses are coastal bermudagrass, African star, and angleton grass.  The woody vegetation is mostly mesquite, retama, huisache, and spiny hackberry."
