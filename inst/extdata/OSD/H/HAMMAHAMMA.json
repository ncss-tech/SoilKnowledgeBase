The particle-size control section is from 1 to 29 inches (A and Bw horizons).  The zone from 1 to 25 inches is medial-skeletal and from 25 to 29 inches is loamy-skeletal.  The soil also would quality as Oxyaquic if such a subgroup were recognized.\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL pedon S91WA-45-005.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
