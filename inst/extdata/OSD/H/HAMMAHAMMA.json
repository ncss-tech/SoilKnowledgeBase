  "OVERVIEW": "The Hammahamma series consists of moderately deep to a cemented layer, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium over dense glacial till.  Hammahamma soils are on glacial valleys and glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 110 inches and average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section is from 1 to 29 inches (A and Bw horizons).  The zone from 1 to 25 inches is medial-skeletal and from 25 to 29 inches is loamy-skeletal.  The soil also would quality as Oxyaquic if such a subgroup were recognized.\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL pedon S91WA-45-005.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
