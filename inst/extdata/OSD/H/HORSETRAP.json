These soils formed in loamy residuum and colluvium from basalt. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches and precipitation falls mostly during the months of July to September. The driest months are March and April. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is 210 to 250 days."
