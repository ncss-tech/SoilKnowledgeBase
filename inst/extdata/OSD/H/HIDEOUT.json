  "REVDATE": "07/2008",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hideout series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium over residuum derived from interbedded sedimentary rocks.  Hideout soils are on hillslopes, scarps, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
