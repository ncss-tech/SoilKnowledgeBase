Rock fragments of gravel and cobbles of quartz and crystalline rock range from 0 to 35 percent in A or Ap horizons, from 0 to 15 percent in the Bt and BC horizons, though subhorizons of the Bt and BC may range to 35 percent, and from 0 to 55 percent in the substratum.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Lloyd series in the same family. The Coronaca, Davidson, Exway, Gwinnett, Hanceville, and Wadesboro series are in closely related families. All these soils developed from residuum. Coronaca soils have a base saturation greater than 35 percent and the clay does not drop back before 60 inches. Gwinnett soils have sola less than 40 inches thick and have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Exway, Hanceville and Wadesboro soils have mixed mineralogy and have rhodic colors throughout the argillic horizon. Lloyd soils formed in residuum and does not have rounded rock in the solum."

The soil formed in old alluvium from felsic and mafic rock, and is underlain with felsic or mafic residuum in some pedons. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 61 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."

The Cecil, Cullen, and Madison soils formed in felsic or mafic crystalline residuum on adjacent upland landform positions. Davidson soils formed in residuum, have rhodic colors throughout the subsoil, and the clay does not decrease before 60 inches. Turbeville soils occur on similar landscapes but do not have a rhodic subsoil and the clay does not decrease before 60 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The December 1996 revision restricts the Hiwassee series to Typic Rhodudults on high terraces. The Hiwassee series was reclassified to Rhodic Kanhapludults in 1988, and to Typic Kanhapludults in 1993. The soil had been consistently mapped as Typic Rhodudults on stream terraces in Virginia. The 2003 revision moved the type location from the mesic piedmont to the thermic piedmont. The classification changed to Rhodic Kanhapludults. The particle size control section was changed to very-fine based on lab data. The 2006 revision to allow loam texture in C horizon. In 2007, the typical profile was moved to Newberry Co. South Carolina. The particle size control section was changed back to fine based on new lab data. In 2008, the slope range was extended to allow 0-1%.  Slope decreased to 25% since there were no data mapunits with a slope beyond 25%.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - zone from the surface to 5 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - zone from 5 to 80 inches (BA and Bt horizons)\nRhodic feature - value of 3 in the upper 50 cm of the kandic horizon.\nMLRA=136\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nCharacterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Center,\nLincoln, Nebraska.
