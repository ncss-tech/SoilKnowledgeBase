  "OVERVIEW": "The Hedoes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from igneous rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
