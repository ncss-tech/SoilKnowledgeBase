  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the base of the Bt (argillic) horizon is 10 inches or less.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 50 to 59 degrees.  The particle size control section includes the Bt horizon and underlying C horizons.  Clay content of the particle size control section ranges from 15 to 24 percent.  Rock fragment content of the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent and is mostly fine gravel with some coarse gravel.  The surface typically is covered by a lag of 25 to 80 percent fine pebbles.  Reaction of the profile is neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  Clay content ranges from 12 to 20 percent.  Pebbles range from 5 to 30 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist.  Texture typically is sandy clay loam or sandy loam with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Clay content ranges from 17 to 25 percent.  Rock fragment content ranges from 25 to 45 percent pebbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and moist.  Texture typically is sandy loam or loamy sand with a clay content of 5 to 10 percent.  Rock fragment content ranges from 40 to 80 percent pebbles.  This horizon may be absent in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Whiteman series in the same family and the Rogert and Redfeather series.  Whiteman soils lack the coarse granitic sands and formed in residuum from limestone.  Rogert soils have mollic epipedons and do not have argillic horizons.  Redfeather soils, when mixed to a depth of 6 inches, have a moist color value of 4 or more."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granite.  Elevation is 7,800 to 9,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and ranges from 15 to 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F. and ranges from 38 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is less than 60 days."
