  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 51 to 58 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is usually dry in late spring and early summer, moist in some part in late July and August, and intermittently dry in fall; ustic regime bordering on aridic.\nThickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 14 inches.   Depth to secondary calcium carbonate, depth to calcic horizon, and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments in the Bt, Bk, and 2Bk horizons are mainly gravel, cobbles, and channers.  These horizons have 25 to 65 percent gravel, 0 to 45 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nParticle-size control section (weighted average):\nNoncarbonate clay content:  18 to 35 percent\nSand content:  30 to 60 percent\nRock fragments:  35 to 60 percent\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. The fine-earth fraction is loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 65 percent.  The fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or clay loam, and averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 15 to 40 percent silt, and 30 to 60 percent sand.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 2 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Rock fragment content ranges from 40 to 90 percent.  The fine-earth fraction is most commonly sandy loam, but may be fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Content of calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent in the part qualifying as a diagnostic calcic horizon. Many pedons have 5 to 20 percent carbonate concretions on the undersides of rock fragments. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon (a C horizon in some pedons) has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y.  The 2Bk horizon is commonly extremely gravelly sand or extremely gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly sandy loam.  Common textures of C horizons are very gravelly sandy loam and very gravelly sandy clay loam.   Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
