Alderpoint soils are not in the database and cannot be competed.  Annum and Mendian soils have a mantle of loess and buried Bt horizons. Brownlee soils do not have a gravelly substratum discontinuity, have lamellae in the lower part and are typically 40 to 60 inches deep over weathered granite. Chirpchatter soils are dry 120 to 140 days. Lompico, Lorena, Meland, Robbscreek and Stacker soils are 20 to 40 inches deep. Dryfalls soils are 40 to 60 inches deep and have andic properties. Ebadlow soils have 10 to 30 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are dry 90 to 105 days. Felton soils have more than 50 percent shale fragments in the C horizons. Fisherhill soils are dry 90 to 105 days and have an average annual soil temperature of 52 to 54 degrees F. Goldendale soils have argillic horizons that extend to depths below 60 inches and are slightly acid or neutral in the argillic horizon. Meystre soils are slightly acid or neutral throughout and lack a gravelly substratum discontinuity. Quiden soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F. Rehfield soils have an aridic soil moisture regime. Schumacher soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and neutral throughout. Stardust soils have more than 25 percent medium and coarser sand, do not have a substratum discontinuity and depth to the base of the argillic horizon is over 45 inches. Updegraff soils are dry more than 90 consecutive days and are 40 to 60 inches deep. Van Horn soils have an average annual soil temperature of 51 to 54 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hellake soils are level to steep on relict lakebed terraces, dissected fan remnants and landslides at elevations of 3,000 to 4,750 feet. These soils formed in lacustrine sediments over alluvium from igneous rocks. . Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches. Average annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. Frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Middlefork, Riverpoint, Staircase and the competing Stardust soils. Middlefork soils are frigid and occur on north-facing slopes. Riverpoint soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on risers and convex shoulders. Staircase soils are coarse-loamy, do not have an argillic horizon and occur on drainageways. Stardust soils occur on fan remnants and landslides."
