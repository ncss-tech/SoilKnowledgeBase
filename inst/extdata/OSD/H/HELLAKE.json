  "OVERVIEW": "The Hellake series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in lacustrine sediments over alluvium from igneous rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent in foothills, canyons and mountain valleys. The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Alderpoint soils are not in the database and cannot be competed.  Annum and Mendian soils have a mantle of loess and buried Bt horizons. Brownlee soils do not have a gravelly substratum discontinuity, have lamellae in the lower part and are typically 40 to 60 inches deep over weathered granite. Chirpchatter soils are dry 120 to 140 days. Lompico, Lorena, Meland, Robbscreek and Stacker soils are 20 to 40 inches deep. Dryfalls soils are 40 to 60 inches deep and have andic properties. Ebadlow soils have 10 to 30 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are dry 90 to 105 days. Felton soils have more than 50 percent shale fragments in the C horizons. Fisherhill soils are dry 90 to 105 days and have an average annual soil temperature of 52 to 54 degrees F. Goldendale soils have argillic horizons that extend to depths below 60 inches and are slightly acid or neutral in the argillic horizon. Meystre soils are slightly acid or neutral throughout and lack a gravelly substratum discontinuity. Quiden soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F. Rehfield soils have an aridic soil moisture regime. Schumacher soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and neutral throughout. Stardust soils have more than 25 percent medium and coarser sand, do not have a substratum discontinuity and depth to the base of the argillic horizon is over 45 inches. Updegraff soils are dry more than 90 consecutive days and are 40 to 60 inches deep. Van Horn soils have an average annual soil temperature of 51 to 54 degrees F."
