  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously mapped as Grover series. The area where Huddleston is mapped was originally mapped as thermic, and later converted to mesic.  These soils feel as if they are higher in silt content than mechanical analysis shows them to be. They have a greasy feel caused by the high mica content. The mica is dominantly soft and mineral structure is destroyed by prolonged rubbing.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 28 inches (Bt horizon)\nHigh content of mica flakes in the Bt, BC, and C horizons\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: No laboratory data available.\nDatabase Information:\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID807365\nUser Pedon ID--89VA019011\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
