  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously mapped as Grover series. The area where Huddleston is mapped was originally mapped as thermic, and later converted to mesic.  These soils feel as if they are higher in silt content than mechanical analysis shows them to be. They have a greasy feel caused by the high mica content. The mica is dominantly soft and mineral structure is destroyed by prolonged rubbing.  The soil horizon depths were revised on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 28 inches (Bt horizon)\nHigh content of mica flakes in the Bt, BC, and C horizons"
