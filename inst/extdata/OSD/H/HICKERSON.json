  "OVERVIEW": "The Hickerson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone and quartzite rocks. Hickerson soils are on flood plains and alluvial flats. Slopes are 1 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
