  "OVERVIEW": "The Half Moon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains, glaciolacustrine stream terraces, and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
