The weighted average content of coarse fragments in the control section ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent and cobble content range from 0 to 10 percent throughout. Volume of stones range from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe Oi horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly decomposed plant material from a mat of decomposed forest leaf litter.\nThe A1, A2 or A3 horizons (where present) have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam.\nThe R horizon is basalt bedrock."
