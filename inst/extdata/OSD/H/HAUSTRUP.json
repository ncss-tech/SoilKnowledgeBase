  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Haustrup series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils that are shallow to a lithic contact with basalt. These soils formed in loess on uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. Permeability is moderate. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The weighted average of clay content in the particle size control section ranges from 8 to 14 percent. The weighted average content of coarse fragments in the control section ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent and cobble content range from 0 to 10 percent throughout. Volume of stones range from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe Oi horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly decomposed plant material from a mat of decomposed forest leaf litter.\nThe A1, A2 or A3 horizons (where present) have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam.\nThe R horizon is basalt bedrock."
