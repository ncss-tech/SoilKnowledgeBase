  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Home Camp soils are on mountains and plateaus.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff, andesite, and basalt with additions of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,495 to 2,365 maters.  The climate is subhumid having a mean annual precipitation of 300 to 400 mm, with most of the precipitation coming as snow.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 7 degrees C and the mean summer temperature is 13 to 14 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 30 to 70 days."
