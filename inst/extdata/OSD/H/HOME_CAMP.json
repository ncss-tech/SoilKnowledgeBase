  "OVERVIEW": "The Home Camp series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks with additions of volcanic ash.  Home Camp soils are on mountains and plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
