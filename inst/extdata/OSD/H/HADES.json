  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 50 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bt horizon.  The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons is 50 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to visible (secondary) carbonates ranges from 54 to 60 inches or more. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 61 to 64 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer. Rock fragments consist of gravel and cobbles and range from 0 to 30 percent in the A and Bt horizons and from 0 to 60 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 1 to 3 moist.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 dry, 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, gravelly silt loam, or gravelly silty clay loam and averages 25 to 35 percent clay.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw or C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  It is sandy loam, loam or silty clay loam.  It is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous and moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hades soils are on mountain slopes, hills, fan remnants, and structural benches. These soils formed in colluvium, till, alluvium, and residuum from sandstone, shale, and quartzite. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. They are on all exposures but are dominantly on north aspects.  Hades soils are at elevations of 4,800 to 8,300 feet. The climate is moist subhumid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F., and the freeze-free period ranges from 65 to 80 days in Utah and 50 to 90 days in Idaho."

Cloud Rim, Croydon, Hume (T) and Isbell soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Hume (T) soils have a fine particle-size control section and have carbonate accumulations. Kilfoil soils have an ochric epipedon and are 20 to 40 inches deep.  Lucky Star soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick, have an E horizon, and are loamy-skeletal.  Moweba soils lack a Bt horizon and are loamy-skeletal.  Vicking soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and a calcic horizon.  Agassiz and Gabica are less than 20 inches thick to bedrock."
