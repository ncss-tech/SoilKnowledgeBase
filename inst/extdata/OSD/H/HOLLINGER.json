    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments of quartz, limestone, and schist range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the solum and 0 to 50 percent in the C horizon.  Some pedons have flakes of mica that generally increases with depth.  Where unlimed, reaction is medium acid to neutral in the solum and slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 4.  Fine earth textures are loam or silt loam.\nThe B horizon has hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 and chroma of 6 through 8.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 and chroma of 6 through 8.  Fine earth texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Some pedons have a thin layer of loamy fine sand.  The C horizon is massive or has platy structure."

Belmont, Lumberton and Pignut soils have bedrock within depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Belmore soils have water worn gravel throughout. Caprell soils formed in as much as 20 inches (51 cm) of loess or other silty material and in loamy till.  Chili, Gallman, Kanawha, Martinsville, Ockley, and Princeton soils are stratified in the lower part of solum. Cliftycreek and Richardville soils formed in up to 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy till and clayey residuum overlying bedrock high in carbonates.  Conestoga and Gallman soils have thicker solum. Crouse soils have depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 60 inches, calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 10 percent, thickness of the loess mantle ranges from 0 to 20 inches.  Greybrook soils formed in loess and an underlying paleosol in lacustrine sediments.  High Gap and Military soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Hickory soils have redox feature in the lower part of the solum. Leroy soils formed in glacial till.  Kidder and Strawn soils have free carbonates in the series control section. Relay soils have B horizons of 2.5Y hue or yellower. Riddles, Kosciusko and Wawasee soils have more sand in the control section.  Senachwine soils formed in as much as 18 inches of loess or other silty material and in the underlying calcareous loamy till.  Skelton soils formed in loamy and silty sediments on river terraces. Turnersburg soils formed in residuum from intermediate or mafic metamorphic or igneous rock. Wawaka soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess and in the underlying till over outwash.  Woodbine soils have an upper solum formed in loess and glacial till and a lower solum formed in residuum weathered from limestone.\nSoils in the closely related families are: Chenault, Coggon, Douds, El Dara, Grayford, Grellton, Hayden, Hebron, Kalamazoo, Kendallville, Letort, Lindley, Mandeville, McHenry, Miami, Mifflin, Nodine, Norden, Owosso, Pecatonica, Rawson, Renova, Richland, Rockbridge, Roseville, Sisson, Strawn, Summitville, Theresa, Westville, Whalan.
