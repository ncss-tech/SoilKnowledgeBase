  "OVERVIEW": "The Hornellsville series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till. They are on bedrock-controlled uplands. Bedrock is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches Permeability is slow or very slow in the subsoil and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 17 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent, by volume, in the A horizon, 3 to 35 percent in the B horizon, and 15 to 60 percent in the C horizon. Rock fragment are dominantly channers or flagstones of shale or siltstone.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. They have granular or subangular blocky structure and very friable to firm consistence. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 1 through 3, and have redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or it is platy. Consistence ranges from friable to firm.\nThe Bw or Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8 with distinct or prominent mottles. Ped faces have chroma of 1 or 2 in the lower part. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the earth fraction. It has subangular blocky or angular blocky structure which is within medium to very coarse prisms in many pedons. It has firm or very firm consistence. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has subangular blocky or pristmatic structure and is massive or platy within the prisms.\nThe C horizon is similar in color and texture to the B horizons but the material is massive, or has plate like divisions inherited from the rock structure. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Some pedons have a Cr or 2Cr horizon up to 10 inches thick.\nThe R or 2R horizon is soft shale or siltstone bedrock that weathers readily in the upper part, and can be cut easily with a spade in the upper few inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Allis, Almond, Hornell, Kanona, and Lamoine series are similar soils in related families. The Allis and Hornell soils have a mesic temperature regime. Almond soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section. Kanona soils are less acid and have a mesic temperature regime. Lamoine soils are not as acid in the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hornellsville soils are nearly level to steep soils on uplands. Slope gradients range from 0 to 40 percent. These soils formed in till, or till and residuum. The till forms a mantle, 20 to 40 inches thick, over acid shale or siltstone bedrock. The till is derived from material like the underlying bedrock. In some places the shale bedrock has weathered and part of the soil mantle is residuum. Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 degrees to 45 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 45 inches; and the mean annual frost-free days range from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 1800 to 2500 feet above sea level."

Hawknest and Mongaup soils are adjacent soils that have lower clay content and are 10 to 20 inches and 20 to 40 inches deep respectively. The well drained Lewbath soils, somewhat poorly drained Ontusia soils, and moderately well drained Willdin soils formed in very deep glacial till deposits and are on adjacent till plains."

Many previously cleared areas are reverting to brush or woodland. Native vegetation is sugar and red maple, white ash, black cherry, oak, eastern hemlock, and eastern white pine."
