  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hercules series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on flood plains.  These soils formed in silty and clayey alluvium with a high content of chert and dolomite fragments.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

The particle-size control section averages 35 to 75 percent gravel and 35 to 60 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon underlying the surface layer has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3. Masses of iron accumulation with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6 are commonly present below a depth of 30 inches.  Texture and reaction are the same as the Ap horizon.\nThe Bw or C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 6.  These horizons are the very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline."
