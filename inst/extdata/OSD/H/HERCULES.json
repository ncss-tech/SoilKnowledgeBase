  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to over 60 inches and commonly extends into the Bw horizon. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 75 percent gravel and 35 to 60 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon underlying the surface layer has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3. Masses of iron accumulation with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6 are commonly present below a depth of 30 inches.  Texture and reaction are the same as the Ap horizon.\nThe Bw or C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 6.  These horizons are the very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hercules soils are on flood plains of small streams.  They formed in silty and clayey alluvium with a high chert gravel content.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gasconade,  Gatewood, Mano and Ocie series.  All these soils occur on adjacent upland areas. Gasconade soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 inches.  Gatewood soils have more clay and less coarse fragments in the subsoil and have bedrock within 40 inches.  Mano and Ocie soils have a lighter colored surface layer."
