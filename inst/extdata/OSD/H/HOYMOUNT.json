  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoymount series consists of deep to sandstone, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from quartzite and sandstone.  Hoymount soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 25 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
