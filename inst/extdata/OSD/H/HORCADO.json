  "OVERVIEW": "The Horcado series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Horcado soils are on backslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
