Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 7,100 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Latierra soils are coarse-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on toeslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Lamesilla soils are coarse-loamy, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on frequently flooded inset fans of eroded fan remnants.  Nazario soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal, have ochric epipedons, and occur on adjacent narrow beveled summits and shoulders of eroded fan remnants."
