  "OVERVIEW": "The Hehe series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite or basalt with an influence of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to weathered bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 20  to 35 percent clay, 10 to 25 percent medium, coarse, and very coarse sand, and 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.   The upper 10 to 20 inches has a moist bulk density of 1.0 to 1.2 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water content of 10 to 15 percent on a air-dried sample.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Base saturation (sum) is 60 to 70 percent in some part of the upper 30 inches of the solum.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very stony loam or very cobbly loam and contains 5 to 35 percent stones, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent gravel, and 0 to 5 percent boulders.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam and contains 10 to 25 percent boulders, 10 to 20 percent stones, 15 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent gravel."
