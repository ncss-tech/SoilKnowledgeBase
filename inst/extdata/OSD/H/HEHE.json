    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the four months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to weathered bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 20  to 35 percent clay, 10 to 25 percent medium, coarse, and very coarse sand, and 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.   The upper 10 to 20 inches has a moist bulk density of 1.0 to 1.2 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water content of 10 to 15 percent on a air-dried sample.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Base saturation (sum) is 60 to 70 percent in some part of the upper 30 inches of the solum.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very stony loam or very cobbly loam and contains 5 to 35 percent stones, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent gravel, and 0 to 5 percent boulders.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam and contains 10 to 25 percent boulders, 10 to 20 percent stones, 15 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hehe soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Elevation is 2000 to 3500 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite or basalt with an influence of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 25 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."
