  "OVERVIEW": "The Hamacer series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian materials derived from mixed rocks that are high in siliceous materials and influenced by volcanic ash and pyroclastic material from tuffs. Hamacer soils are on flood plains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
