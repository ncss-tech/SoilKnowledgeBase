  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hamacer soils are on flood plains and stream terraces at elevations of 1,770 to 1,860 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in alluvial and eolian materials derived from mixed rocks that are high in siliceous materials and influenced by volcanic ash and pyroclastic material from tuffs.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C."

Shipley soils have moderately coarse textured calcareous profiles with less than 20 percent durinodes.   Silverado soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections with cambic horizons."
