  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the petrocalcic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments in the control section range from 25 to 60 percent pebbles and 0 to 40 percent cobbles.  Clay content in the control section ranges from 8 to 18 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Surface horizons under long-term irrigation may have mollic colors provided they are less than 3 inches thick.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly modifiers.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and moist.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly modifiers.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bkm horizon consists of 45 to 75 percent by volume pebbles and cobbles in an indurated, laminated calcium carbonate matrix.  Very thin, discontinuous laminations of a harder substance, possibly silica, have been observed in some pedons.  This diagnostic petrocalcic horizon can be broken along original pendant bridgings with a geology pick and excavated with difficulty by a backhoe.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam with very gravelly or extremely gravelly modifiers.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 30 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
