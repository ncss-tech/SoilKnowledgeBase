  "OVERVIEW": "The Hungry series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from serpentinitic rocks.  Hungry soils are on mountain side slopes and have slopes of 35 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 1880 mm (74 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 11 C. (52 degrees F.).",
