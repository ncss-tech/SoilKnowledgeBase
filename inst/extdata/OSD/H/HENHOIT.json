    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 19 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A1 and B2t horizons ranges from 50 to more than 60 inches.  Base saturation is less than 75 percent in some or all parts above a depth of 30 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 43 degrees to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 69 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry for 50 to 85 consecutive days during the summer.  Rock fragments consist of rounded quartzite and sandstone cobbles and pebbles, and range from 20 to 45 percent in the A1 horizon, and 35 to 70 percent in the B2t horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It ranges from gravelly loam to very gravelly loam or cobbly loam.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral, and is 10 to 19 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 8 dry and moist.  It ranges from very gravelly clay loam to gravelly or very gravelly loam or to cobbly clay loam or very cobbly clay loam.  Structure ranges from weak to strong, fine to coarse, subangular blocky.  Clay films are few to many, thin.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.  The B3t horizon does not occur in some pedons."

Also Forsey, Holmes and Horrocks soils have sola less than 30 inches thick, and lack hue as red as 2.5YR in the B2t horizon; Stemilt soils have hue of 10YR only in the B2t horizon.  Sattley soils have dominant hue of 10YR but have some 7.5YR hue with chroma of 2 in the B2t horizons and have a solum thickness of less than 50 inches."

These soils formed in residuum, colluvium, and local alluvium weathered from conglomerate of sandstone and quartzite.  The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 degrees to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 57 degrees to 65 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 60 to 80 days."

St. Marys soils lack argillic horizons.  Schuster soils have A2 horizons and summer soil temperatures are less than 59 degrees F."
