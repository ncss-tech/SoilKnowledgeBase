  "OVERVIEW": "The Howash series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from andesite with an influence of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 12 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
