    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist and are not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for as long as 45 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.   Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Phosphate retention is 60 to 80 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus 1/2 iron is between 0.40 and 2.0 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction.  There is 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction.  The 15-bar moisture is 5 to 15 percent on air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and 35 to 55 percent rock fragments.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Howash soils have a moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc throughout.  It is moderately to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.   It is very gravelly, very cobbly, or very stony sandy loam.  It has 10 to 45 percent gravel, 0 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 30 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam with 15 to 40 percent gravel, 10 to 50 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe C horizon is loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand with 30 to 50 percent cobbles, 15 to 25 percent gravel, and 0 to 5 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Howash soils are on strongly sloping to very steep side slopes of mountains.  Elevation ranges from 3400 to 5600 feet.  Slopes are 12 to 65 percent. The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from andesite with an influence of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and warm and moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 90 inches.   The mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 90 days."
