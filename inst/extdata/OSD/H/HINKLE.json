  "OVERVIEW": "The Hinkle series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey material weathered from old alluvium of granitic outwash. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on broad summits and shoulder slopes of terrace sediments in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C) and the Wichita Mountains (MLRA 82B). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 660 mm (26 in).",
