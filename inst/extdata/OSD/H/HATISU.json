  "OVERVIEW": "The Hatisu Series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and cinders. The Hatisu soils are on dissected backslopes and footslopes on mountainsides of stratovolcanic islands. Slopes range from 15 to 150 percent. The mean annual temperature is 25 degrees C (77 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 2030 millimeters (80 inches).",
