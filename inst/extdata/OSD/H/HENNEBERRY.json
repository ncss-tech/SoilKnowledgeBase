  "REVDATE": "01/2012",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Henneberry series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from red limestone conglomerate or other red calcareous rock types. These soils are on ridges, hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
