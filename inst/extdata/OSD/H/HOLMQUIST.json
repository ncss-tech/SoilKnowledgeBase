  "OVERVIEW": "The Holmquist series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in stratified coarse-loamy alluvium on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The 10 to 40 inch control section averages between 14 and 18 percent clay and between 20 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser. The soil typically is calcareous to the surface. It typically has few to many nests of salt above the water table, but some pedons do not have salts to a depth of 10 inches. The decrease in organic carbon is irregular with depth.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry) and chroma of 1 to 3. Typically, it is loam, but is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in some pedons. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2.5 to 5 (3 to 7 dry) and chroma of 1 to 4. It is stratified loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam. Layers of coarser or finer textures are in some pedons. Reaction ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline. Buried A horizons are in some pedons."

Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in calcareous, recent alluvium. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 120 to 140 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 2800."

Buse and Langhei soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon with depth.  Edgeley soils have paralithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Kloten soils have lithic contact within depths of 20 inches.  La Prairie soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.  LaDelle soils are fine-silty.  The well drained Barnes, Buse, and Langhei soils are on adjacent glacial till plains. Edgeley and Kloten soils are on adjacent uplands.  The moderately well drained LaDelle and La Prairie soils are on slightly higher flood plains and terraces."
