  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon ranges from l3 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to l0YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma 2 to 4.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR to l0YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma 3 to 4.  The E horizon is discontinuous in some pedons.  The A and E horizon are loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly or very gravelly counterparts.  Fragments of ironstone range from l to 45 percent by volume of this horizon.  The fragments are of gravel, cobble, and stone size and range up to 3 feet across in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, and gray range from none to few in the upper Bt horizons and few to many in the lower Bt horizons.  The mottles are inherited from the partially weathered shale and sandstone.  Texture is sandy clay or clay, with clay content ranging from 35 to 60 percent.  The Bt horizon contains l to l0 percent by volume ironstone pebbles.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon is stratified or interbedded sandy loam, clay loam, weakly cemented sandstone, or soil materials weathered from shale.  The amount of sandstone or shaly material is variable and either may be absent in some pedons.  Roots penetrate the materials but are mainly concentrated along fractures or cleavage planes.  The loamy materials and sandstone are reddish, yellowish, or brownish and the clayey materials derived from shale are mainly in shades of gray.   Flakes of mica are visible mostly along cleavage planes between strata and range from few to common.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid"

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aubrey, Marquez, and Rek series.  Similar soils are the Birome, Cuthbert, Galilee, Jedd, Kirvin, Newco, and Urland series.  Aubrey soils have a paralithic contact with shale, occur, and have mica flakes in the lower profile.  In addition, Aubrey soils developed from Cretaceous Age materials.  Marquez soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick.  Rek soils have a paralithic contact between 60 and 80 inches.  Birome and Jedd soils have base saturation greater than 35 percent.  Cuthbert, Galilee, Kirvin, Newco, and Urland soils are moist in the moisture control section for longer periods of time."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hearne soils occupy gently sloping to steep uplands.  On steeper areas these soils are usually on narrow side slopes on ridgetops.  On gently sloping areas, these soils are on low, rounded hills.  Slopes are mainly 5 to 15 percent but range from l to 25 percent.  The soil formed from acid stratified loamy and shaly materials.  Geology at the type location is the Reklaw Formation of the Tertiary age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 40 inches.  Frost free days range from 260 to 280 days, and elevations range from 300 to 450 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 52 to 64."

Padina and Silstid soils are on smooth broad areas in positions slightly higher and have thick sandy surface layers.  Robco soils are on concave positions slightly lower in the landscape, have sandy surface layer, and contain gray mottles due to wetness."
