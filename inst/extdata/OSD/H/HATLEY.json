  "OVERVIEW": "The Hatley series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess or water laid silty deposits and in the underlying till on moraines and drumlins.  Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle and moderate or moderately rapid in the till.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand is greater than 40 inches.  Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 40 inches thick. The particle-size control section averages 5 to 17 percent clay and 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser.   Volume of rock fragments averages from 0 to 35 percent in the silty mantle and from 5 to 35 percent in the till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the silty mantle and from 5 to 25 percent in the till.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 20 percent throughout the soil.  Volume of stones and boulders ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Stones and boulders are on the surface and throughout the soil in some pedons and stony and bouldery phases are recognized.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum except that it ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum. Redox accumulations typically are throughout the soil. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less occur within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and saturation occurs there for some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the A or Ap is silt loam or cobbly silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or the gravely or cobbly analogs.\nHatley soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 5.  Texture is silt loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with colors and textures like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have 2E/B or 2B/E horizons, or both, especially where the silty mantle is on the thinner side. The 2E part has color like the E horizon described above. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravely or cobbly analogs. The 2Bt part has color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described below.\nThe 2Bt horizon typically has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR but some pedons have hue of 2.5Y.  Value is 4 to 6 and chroma is typically 3 to 6.  Some pedons have dominant chroma of 2 in the lower part of the 2Bt horizon.  Texture of the 2Bt horizon typically is loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs. Small pockets of sand or gravelly sand are in the 2C horizon in some pedons."

Brennyville, Magnor, Mora, and Stinnett soils have a densic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Fallcreek soils do not have a mantle with more than 50 percent silt or it is less than 12 inches thick. Glendenning soils do not have a mantle with more than 50 percent silt and have a densic contact at a depth of 60 to 80 inches. Magroc soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Maincreek soils have a densic contact at a depth of 20 to 38 inches and have more than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Oesterle soils have mor than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section within a depth of 40 inches. Plover soils do not have coarse fragments and have stratified loamy and sandy textures in the lower part of the series control section within a depth of 40 inches.
