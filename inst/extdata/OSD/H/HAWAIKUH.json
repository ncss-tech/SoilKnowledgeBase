  "STATES": "AZ,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hawaikuh series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow and slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, and stream alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Hawaikuh soils are on fan terraces on valley sides and stream terraces on valley floors. Slopes range from 1 to  6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
