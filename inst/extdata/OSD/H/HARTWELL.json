  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hartwell soils are on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in loess over old clayey alluvium and/or residuum from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1070 mm (37 to 42 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 16 degrees C (58 to 61 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barco, Barden and Deepwater soils.  Barco soils are fine-loamy with bedrock at 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 inches).  Barden soils do not have an abrupt textural change.  Deepwater soils are fine-silty.  These soils are downslope from the Hartwell soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Potential for surface runoff is slow.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.4 to 14 micrometers per second) in the A and E horizons and moderately low (0.4 to 1.4 micrometers per second) and low (0.01 to 0.4 micrometers per second) in the Btg and BC horizons.  Permeability is slow.  A perched water table has its upper limit at a depth of 15 to 60 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) during November to April."

The thickness of loess is thought to mostly range from two to four feet where this series is mapped.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nmollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches), and approximately from 38 to 56 cm (15 to 22 inches) (Ap and Bt horizons);\nalbic horizon--the zone from 25 to 38 cm (10 to 15 inches) (E horizon);\nargillic horizon--the zone from approximately 38 to 107 cm (15 to 42 inches) (2Bt, 2Btg, 3Btg1, and 3Btg2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
