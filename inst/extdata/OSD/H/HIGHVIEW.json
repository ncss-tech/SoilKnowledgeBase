  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Highview series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in colluvial material weathered from gray Permian shale.  These sloping to steep soils are on backslopes of hills on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 32 inches.",

Some pedons have hue of 5YR in this horizon where the colluvial surface is influenced by red sandstone and shale.  Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, channery silty clay, channery silty clay loam, very channery silty clay loam, very channery silty clay, or very channery clay loam.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, channery silty clay, very channery silty clay, or very channery silty clay loam.  Some pedons are calcareous in this horizon."

The Masham soils are on similar landscapes where the shales are redder.  Steedman soils are on gently sloping or sloping back slopes and foot slopes.  Lucien soils are on summits above the Highview soils and are underlain by red sandstone at depths less than 20 inches.  Westsum soils are on very gently sloping or gently sloping back slopes and foot slopes."
