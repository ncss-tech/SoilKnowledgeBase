  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum thickness and depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 36 inches.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.30 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   The control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and is less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser material.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 10 percent.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.  It has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and commonly has lenses of very fine sandy loam within the varves.  Reaction usually is slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hadencreek soils are on glacial lake terraces and basins and formed in glacial lake sediments with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,700 to 3,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."

Donavan, Republic, Ret, and Sanpoil soils are coarse-loamy.  Loony and Louploup soils are ashy over loamy.  Martella soils have an argillic horizon.  Nevine soils are ashy over loamy-skeletal.  Torboy soils are sandy.  Loony, Louploup, Martella, Nevine, and Torboy soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Also Sanpoil soils hae an aquic moisture regime.  Donavan soils are mesic.  Also, all of the above soils lack an accumulation of secondary carbonates in the lower subsoil."
