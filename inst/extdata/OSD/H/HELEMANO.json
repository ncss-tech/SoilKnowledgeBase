Near the toe of slopes the solum is normally over 60 inches thick and commonly stony throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR.  Effervescence in the A horizon ranges from none to slight.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 6 when moist."

Kahana soils have strong structure in the B horizon and effervescence with hydrogen peroxide throughout.  Niu soils have weak structure in the A horizon and upper B horizon and effervesce with hydrogen peroxide in the control section.  Wailuku soils have 5YR hue in the B horizon and effervescence with hydrogen peroxide throughout."

The slopes are convex and are from 100 to 500 feet in length.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium weathered from basic igneous material of the Koolau and Waianae Ranges.  Mean annual rainfall is 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.; average January temperature is about 69 degrees F.; and average July temperature is about 75 degrees F. Annual pan evaporation is 40 to 60 inches, and averages 50."

Leilehua soils have an argillic horizon and are extremely acid throughout the solum.  Manana soils have a thin panlike layer at depths of 15 to 50 inches and have an argillic horizon.  Molokai soils have an aridic moisture regime and have weak structure in the A horizon.  Wahiawa soils effervesce with hydrogen peroxide throughout the profile and have thin patchy clay films in the lower part of the Bo horizon."
