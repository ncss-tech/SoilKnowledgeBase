  "OVERVIEW": "The Helemano series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from basic igneous rock.  Helemano soils are on gulch sides with slopes of 30 to 90 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 50 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",

The slopes are convex and are from 100 to 500 feet in length.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium weathered from basic igneous material of the Koolau and Waianae Ranges.  Mean annual rainfall is 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.; average January temperature is about 69 degrees F.; and average July temperature is about 75 degrees F. Annual pan evaporation is 40 to 60 inches, and averages 50."

Leilehua soils have an argillic horizon and are extremely acid throughout the solum.  Manana soils have a thin panlike layer at depths of 15 to 50 inches and have an argillic horizon.  Molokai soils have an aridic moisture regime and have weak structure in the A horizon.  Wahiawa soils effervesce with hydrogen peroxide throughout the profile and have thin patchy clay films in the lower part of the Bo horizon."
