  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact ranges from 3 to 20 inches.  The soil is typically calcareous to the surface but is leached up to 8 inches in some thicker pedons but never leached throughout.  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The particle size control section is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and 20 to 70 percent sand.  Coarse fragments in the control section range from 0 to 35 percent shale ships of which about half break down upon pretreatment.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  EC ranges from 2 to 4 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Reaction is mildly through strongly alkaline.\nThe AC horizon, absent in thinner pedons, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Some minor secondary accumulations of carbonates occur in many pedons so a designator of Bk is applicable for this horizon.  Gypsum crystals occur irregularly in some pedons.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline unless buffered by calcium sulfate to mildly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon consists of soft, calcareous shale interbedded with thin lenses of sandy shale and loamstone.  The soil-bedrock interface is a paralithic contact.  Carbonates and gypsum occur throughout the bedrock as thin streaks, filaments, and crystals between platelets.  Thin lenses of lithic or fissile shale occur but are discontinuous."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Coaldraw, Hatermus, and Huguston series.  The Coaldraw soils have 5 to 35 percent gypsum in the control section.  The Hatermus soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium throughout.  The Huguston soils have 5 to 18 percent clay throughout the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Haterton soils are on ridge and hill backslopes, shoulders, and summits and also occur on nearly level rock-controlled uplands.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from calcareous shale.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent and both complex and simple.  Elevations are 6,400 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and ranges from 6 to 10 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees and ranges from 39 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 100 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."
