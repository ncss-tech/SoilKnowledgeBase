  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F.  Hazeldell soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the 3 months following the summer solstice.  The solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  Hue is 10YR to 5YR throughout the solum.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  Based on 15-bar water, the particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent clay and is 15 to 35 percent rock fragments many highly weathered.  Base saturation, by sum of cations, at 1.8 meters below the soil surface is less than 35 percent.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Texture is gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam.\nThe Bt horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  Texture is gravelly clay loam, gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam or clay loam in the upper 20 inches and ranges to very gravelly clay loam and gravelly clay below."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hazeldell soils are on foothills at elevations of 200 to 1,800 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt.  The climate is marine type with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The growing season is 175 to 240 days."

Baumgard soils are fine-loamy and have an andic surface layer.   Mart soils have a mollic epipedon.  Melbourne soils have a base saturation of more than 35 percent (by sum) and less than 15 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Prather soils have a base saturation (by sum) of more than 35 percent in the lower part of the argillic horizon and are mottled.  Salkum soils have kaolinitic mineralogy. Schneider soils have a cambic horizon and are loamy-skeletal."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 7 inches and an argillic horizon from 7 to more than 60 inches.  The argillic horizon has a base saturation (by sum) of 35 percent or less below a depth of 40 inches.  Characterization data are available on this soil--sample numbers S84WA- 015-011 and S84WA-015-006.  This soil was previously classified as clayey, mixed, mesic Xeric Haplohumults.  Classification change based on National Soil Taxonomy Handbook, Issue No. 12 which re-establishes Palehumults.\nA deep phase of Hazeldale was recognized in Cowlitz County, Washington when the series was classified as a Haplohumults.  This phase would now be recognized as a new series with a Xeric Haplohumults classification.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
