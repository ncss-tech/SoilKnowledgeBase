  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  These soils have free carbonates in all parts with calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 30 percent throughout.  The higher values are in the calcic horizon.  The depth to the calcic horizon is less than 16 inches.  Typically most pedons do not have rock fragments.  The particle-size control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent noncarbonate clay, with an average of 50 percent and less than 15 percent fine sand coarser.  The average linear extensibility is estimated to be about 10.7 centimeters in the upper 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  Texture is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.  Effervescence is slight to violent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Tongues of A horizon extend to depths as much as 36 inches in some pedons.\nThe Bkssg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Chroma of 2 is allowed if there are distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Effervescence is strong or violent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Chroma of 2 is allowed if there are distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Effervescence is slight to violent. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Distinct or prominent high chroma redoximorphic concentrations are present in most pedons.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Silty clay loam textures with more than 35 percent noncarbonate clay are allowed.  Effervescence is slight to strong.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Masses of gypsum crystals are in the B and C horizon in some pedons.  Some pedons have sandy 2C horizons below a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hegne soils have slightly convex to slightly concave slopes of less than 2 percent on glacial lake plains and in a few places these soils are on flood plains.  These soils commonly are on the higher lying positions of microrelief topography.  They formed in clayey lacustrine sediments of Late Wisconsin age.   Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 27 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 140.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 1800 feet."

The Hegne soils are found in a complex with these associated soils on slightly higher positions. Fargo soils do not contain a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification of these soils is in question as to whether they should be in the Typic or Aeric subgroup of Calciaquerts.  This needs further investigation.  This series was previously classified in the Typic Calciaquolls subgroup.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 18 inches (Ap and A portion of A/Bkg horizons); calcic horizon - the zone from 10 to 34 inches (B portion of A/Bkg and Bkg horizons); vertic criteria - slickensides and cracks filled with A material in the zone from 10 to 34 inches (Bkssg1 and Bkssg2 horizons); aquic moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record number is MN0053.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
