  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hotter series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived dominately from sandstone and shale.  Hotter soils are on mountain slopes and structural benches.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
