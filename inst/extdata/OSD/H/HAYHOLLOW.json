  "OVERVIEW": "The Hayhollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from mixed stream alluvium.  Hayhollow soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
