  "OVERVIEW": "The Highcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments, silty alluvium from lake sediments, and mixed alluvium.  They are on lake terraces and fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate.  Highcreek soils have slopes of 4 to 25 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
