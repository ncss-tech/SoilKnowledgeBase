The Bickleton soils typically moderately deep to very or extremely gravelly material and have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches.  Lebec soils are calcareous throughout and are 20 to 40 inches deep over limestone bedrock."

The soil formed in lacustrine sediments, silty alluvium from lake sediments, and mixed alluvium.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches and average annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The frost free period is 100 to 120 days."
