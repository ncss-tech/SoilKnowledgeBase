It is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  It has an abrupt smooth to wavy boundary.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Pedons with Bt horizons of 2.5YR throughout have moist values of 4 or more in some part.  The Bt1 and Bt2 horizons are sandy clay, clay, or clay loam with clay contents of 35 to 50 percent.  The Bt3 and Bt4 horizons are sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid in the upper Bt horizons and is neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower Bt horizons.  Some pedons are calcareous at depths of 50 to 80 inches.  A few pedons have gray or grayish brown mottles below a depth of 30 inches."

Castell soils are 20 to 40 inches thick over gneiss bedrock.  Pedernales soils have calcic horizons within 60 inches.  Voca soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick over granite bedrock.  Weswind soils have semiactive CEC activity class, sola less than 80 inches, and are moderately well drained.  Wichita soils contain secondary carbonates within 28 inches of the surface and have a calcic horizon in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Winters soils contain secondary carbonates at a depth of 30 to 50 inches.  Acove soils have a broken sandstone layer in the upper Bt horizon.  Bluegrove soils are 20 to 40 inches thick to bedrock.  Grandfield and Miles soils have fine-loamy control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hamby soils are on plains.  Slopes are mostly less than 2 percent, but may range up to 5 percent on convex knobs and footslopes.  The soils formed in residuum loamy and clayey cretaceous sediments or outwash from these materials.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 23 to 36 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 210 to 240 days and elevations range from 1,200 to 2,400 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 32 to 46."
