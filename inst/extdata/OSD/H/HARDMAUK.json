They formed in loess over glacial till (Kittitas Drift) with a minor amount of volcanic ash in the surface. Elevation is 1,800 to 2,500 feet. These soils are in a climate with warm moderately dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.
