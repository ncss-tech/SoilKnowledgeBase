  "OVERVIEW": "The Hesson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in old, mixed alluvium.  Hesson soils are on high terraces and terrace escarpments, and have slopes of 0 to 55 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent rounded quartzite pebbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  It is gravelly in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Clay films range from few faint in the upper part continuous distinct in the part.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Redox features occur below a depth of 60 inches in some pedons."
