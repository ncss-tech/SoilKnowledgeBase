    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.  The solum depth is more than 70 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent rounded quartzite pebbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  It is gravelly in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  Clay films range from few faint in the upper part continuous distinct in the part.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Redox features occur below a depth of 60 inches in some pedons."

Hesson soils formed in old alluvium of quartzitic and basic igneous rock origin.  The climate is mild; with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 to 75 inches.  The average January temperature is about 36 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 220 days."
