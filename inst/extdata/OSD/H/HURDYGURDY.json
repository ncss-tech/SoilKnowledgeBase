  "REVDATE": "04/2003",
  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hurdygurdy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in ash influenced loess over glacial till. Hurdygurdy soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 33 degrees F.",
