Boomstick, Doorkiss and Fortyday soils are 36 to 50 cm deep to bedrock.  Checkett soils have bedrock at depths of 38 to 50 cm. Chubard soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms. Cottle soils are noneffervescent in the surface and upper parts of the argillic horizon. Gabbvally soils do not have identifiable secondary carbonates and are intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days between July and October. Nevo soils have 25 to 33 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Olac soils have 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon and do not have identifiable secondary carbonates. Old Camp soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have 50 to 75 percent rock fragments most of which are cobbles and stones. Phliss soils average 50 to 70 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section most of which are channers. Richinde are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to convection storms. Rowel soils average 50 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section most of which are cobbles, have argillic horizons with 40 to 55 percent clay, and are intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October. Soughe soils average 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and do not have identifiable secondary carbonates. Stewval soils are intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October. Thike soils have 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have rock fragments of granite, and do not have identifiable secondary carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hooplite soils are on hills and mountains. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,460 to 2,256 meters. The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
