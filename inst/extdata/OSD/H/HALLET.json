  "OVERVIEW": "The Hallet series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on alluvial fans and in drainageways.  These soils formed in alluvium over alluvium dominated by pumice.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
