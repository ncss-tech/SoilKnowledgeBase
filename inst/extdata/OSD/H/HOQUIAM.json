  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hoquiam soils are on broad ridgetops and shoulder slopes of ground moraines in uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in old reworked sedimentary alluvium deposited over deeply weathered piedmont glacial drift of early Pleistocene age.  Elevation ranges from 100 to 900 feet. They are in a humid marine climate with cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers. Annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 130 inches. The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 62 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 200 to 240 days."
