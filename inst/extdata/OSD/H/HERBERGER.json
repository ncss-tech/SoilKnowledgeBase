    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Herberger soils are on outwash plains and fan remnants.  Elevations range from 1,370 to 1,525 meters.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  They formed in tuffaceous sediments over glaciofluvial deposits with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface layers.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches (350 to 500 millimeters).  The mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C.  The frost free period is 30 to 80 days."

Fopiano and Prag soils are found on sideslopes of fan remnants.  Fopiano soils are shallow to a paralithic contact whereas Prag is moderately deep.  Gerow and Silvies soils are located on broad floodplains.  Gerow and Silvies soils have redoximorphic concentrations within 76 cm of the soil surface.  Laycock and Southworth soils are on hills, have an \"O\" horizon, and are shallow and moderately deep to shale bedrock, respectively.  Lemke soils are on fan remnants and have an \"O\" horizon and are shallow to a densic layer.  Luckycreek soils are on broad terraces, are fine-loamy, and very deep to any bedrock.  Pothole soils occur as bowl-shaped depressions on fan remnants and are in the \"fine-loamy ovDer clayey\" family.  Rastus soils are moderately deep to a duripan and are located on fan remnants with Herburger soils.  Skullgulch soils are in small swales of fan remnants and lack any root restrictive layer and are in the fine family.  Sylvaille soils are on outwash plains, are loamy, and are shallow to a densic layer."

The A horizon is not sufficiently thick to qualify for the vitrandic subgroup.\nArgillic horizon: zone from 10 to 61 cm (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section:  zone from 10 to 60 cm (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons)\nDensic layers:  zone from 61 to 145 cm (3Cd1 and 3Cd2 horizons)\nSoil moisture regime: Xeric\nFrequently the soil surface is littered with sub-rounded, gravel-sized fragments of shale, tuff, limestone, serpentine, and occasionally obsidian.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
