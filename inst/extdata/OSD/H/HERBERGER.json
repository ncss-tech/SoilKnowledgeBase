  "OVERVIEW": "The Herberger series consists of moderately deep to a densic layer, well drained soils formed in tuffaceous sediments over glaciofluvial deposits with a minor influence of volcanic ash in the surface layers. They are found on fan remnants and outwash plains.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches (430 millimeters), and the mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C.",

Fopiano and Prag soils are found on sideslopes of fan remnants.  Fopiano soils are shallow to a paralithic contact whereas Prag is moderately deep.  Gerow and Silvies soils are located on broad floodplains.  Gerow and Silvies soils have redoximorphic concentrations within 76 cm of the soil surface.  Laycock and Southworth soils are on hills, have an \"O\" horizon, and are shallow and moderately deep to shale bedrock, respectively.  Lemke soils are on fan remnants and have an \"O\" horizon and are shallow to a densic layer.  Luckycreek soils are on broad terraces, are fine-loamy, and very deep to any bedrock.  Pothole soils occur as bowl-shaped depressions on fan remnants and are in the \"fine-loamy ovDer clayey\" family.  Rastus soils are moderately deep to a duripan and are located on fan remnants with Herburger soils.  Skullgulch soils are in small swales of fan remnants and lack any root restrictive layer and are in the fine family.  Sylvaille soils are on outwash plains, are loamy, and are shallow to a densic layer."

The A horizon is not sufficiently thick to qualify for the vitrandic subgroup.\nArgillic horizon: zone from 10 to 61 cm (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section:  zone from 10 to 60 cm (2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons)\nDensic layers:  zone from 61 to 145 cm (3Cd1 and 3Cd2 horizons)\nSoil moisture regime: Xeric\nFrequently the soil surface is littered with sub-rounded, gravel-sized fragments of shale, tuff, limestone, serpentine, and occasionally obsidian.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
