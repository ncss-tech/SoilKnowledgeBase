Hospiter soils have an argillic horizon and are fine-loamy with less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Tellopeak soils are shallow to bedrock.  Hewent soils are moderately deep and have an argillic horizon. Hospiter soils are located on more stable mountain slopes. Tellopeak and Hewent soils are on convex or strongly convex portions of the mountain slopes."
