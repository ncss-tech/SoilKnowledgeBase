  "OVERVIEW": "The Howler series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metamorphic volcanic rocks. Howler soils are moderately deep to bedrock with fractures less than 10 centimeters apart. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 50 to 110 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1524 millimeters (60 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
