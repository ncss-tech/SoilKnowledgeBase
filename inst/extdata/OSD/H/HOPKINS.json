  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches, depth to calcareous material ranges from 6 to 15 inches, and depth to C2 horizon material ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  The organic carbon content of the mollic epipedon ranges from .8 to 1.5 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from less than 1 to 3 percent but there is no continuous distinct horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation, although coatings of calcium carbonate may occur on some of the rock fragments in the upper portions of C2 horizon.  The upper portion of the control section ranges in clay from 18 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments are up to 6 inches in length and range from 15 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments in the C2 horizon range from 35 to 90 percent by volume and from 6 to 15 inches in length.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F, and the summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from slightly hard to soft and is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hopkins soils are on upland hills, ridges, and valley side slopes.  Slope gradients range from 2 to more than 30 percent.  The soils formed from highly fractured rhyolite or deposits of very coarse textured rhyolitic colluvium. The average annual precipitation is 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 36 to 44 degrees F."
