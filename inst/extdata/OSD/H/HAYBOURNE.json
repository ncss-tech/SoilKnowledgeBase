  "OVERVIEW": "The Haybourne series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks or from mixed sources.  Haybourne soils are on inset fans, alluvial fans, fan remnants, ballenas, lake terraces, fan skirts, and fan aprons.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
