These soils formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks or from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,370 to 2,012 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."
