These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to hilly `a`a flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in sandy material from `a`a lava and from basic volcanic ash.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1270 to 2030 millimeters (50 to 80 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 640 to 1020 millimeters (25 to 40 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 16 to 22 degrees C (61 to 71 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
