  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is more than 60 inches deep and is stratified. Vertical cracks extend from the surface and range from 1/2 to 1 inches wide at a depth of 20 inches at some time in most years. A few slickensides are present in most pedons but they do not intersect, or wedge-shaped aggregates are present. The organic matter is 1 percent or less at the surface and decreased irregularly with increasing depth. It is typically saline-sodic below the A horizon. Salinity ranges from 1 to 16 decisiemens per meter in the surface and 4 to 30 decisiemens per meter in the lower part of the profile. The soil ranges from slightly effervescent to violently effervescent with carbonates throughout to a depth of 20 inches.  The substratum below a depth of 20 inches ranges from noneffervescent to violently effervescent.  Gypsum crystals may absent in some pedons and are a result of additions of gypsum to the soil by farmers.  The mean annual soil temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F. Distinct or prominent redoximorphic iron and manganese accumulations or depletions occur in the lower part of the A horizon and in the B horizon.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 5Y 7/1, 6/1 or 6/2, and 2.5Y 6/2, and moist color of 5Y 3/2, 4/2, 5/2 or 4/3, and 2.5Y 4/2. It commonly is clay or silty clay but may have thin (3 to 6 inches) surface layers of fine sandy loam. This horizon is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 5Y 5/1, 6/1, 7/1, 5/2, 6/2; 10YR 7/3; or 2.5Y 6/2 and 7/2, and moist color of 5Y 4/1, 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 4/3; 2.5Y 4/2 and 5/2; or 10YR 5/4. It is clay or silty clay and has thin strata of silt loam or silty clay loam. This horizon is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Houser soils occur on basin rims. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from granitic and sedimentary rocks. Elevations are 180 to 220 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 7 inches. The climate is arid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 85 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F. Frost-free season is 260 to 275 days."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium runoff; very slow permeability. Most areas of this soil are now partially drained or drained due to dams and drainage ditches in the area. The previous water table was at 1 to 2 feet. A water table now varies with depth depending on the amount and kind of reclamation. The frequency of flooding is none to rare and the duration of flooding is more than one month."
