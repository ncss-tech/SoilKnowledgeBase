Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the A and B horizons, and moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of to 2 or 3.  Content of pebbles and cobbles composed of calcite ranges from 0 to 15 percent, by volume.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Content of pebbles and cobbles composed of calcite ranges from 10 to 30 percent, by volume.  Calcium carbonate masses, nodules, concretions, or filaments range from few to many.\nThe Bkm horizon is extremely hard, partly silicified marl.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Mottles in shades of white, yellow, or brown range from none to many.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Calcium carbonate masses, nodules, filaments, or concretions range from few to many.  Content of pebbles and cobbles composed of calcite ranges from 0 to 30 percent, by volume."

The climate is tropical semiarid. The mean average air temperature ranges from 76 to 82 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches."

In addition, Arawak soils are on higher positions and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Glynn and Hogensborg soils are on slightly lower alluvial fans and terraces and are very deep.  Sion soils are on higher side slopes and valley floors, are very deep, and have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections."
