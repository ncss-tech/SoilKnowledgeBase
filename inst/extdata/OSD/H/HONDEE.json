  "OVERVIEW": "The Hondee series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. They are on upper lake terraces and alluvial fans.  Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 1 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches. The average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
