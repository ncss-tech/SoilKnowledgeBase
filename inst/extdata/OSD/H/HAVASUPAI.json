  "OVERVIEW": "The Havasupai series consists of shallow to hardpan, well drained soils on fan terraces.  These soils formed in fan alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slope is 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
