  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 72 inches, however, clay content decreases by more than 20 percent if deeper than 60 inches.  Depth to hard limestone ranges from 40 to 84 inches or more.  In limed soils, the upper part of the solum ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline and the lower part of the solum and substratum ranges from moderately acid through neutral. Hagerstown soils are low in rock fragments with less than 15 percent by volume.  The weighted average clay content of the textural control section is between 35 and 60 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Subhorizons of some pedons are 7.5YR.  Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC or BCt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8; it ranges from being uniform in color to moderately variegated. Texture is silty clay, clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon if present has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; it ranges from being uniform in color to moderately or highly variegated.  Texture ranges from silt loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam to clay.  In many pedons the C horizon is absent or is a very thin transition horizon between solum and bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hagerstown soils occupy valley floors and the adjacent hills. In some areas rock outcrops are common surface features.  Most slopes are less than 15 percent but range up to 45 percent.  The soils developed in materials weathered from hard gray limestone of rather high purity.  The climate is temperate and moderately humid, with a mean annual temperature of 45 to 58 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation of 30 to 45 inches."
