  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hannegan soils are on glacially modified mountain backslopes at elevations of 3,800 to 4,100 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and colluvium from phyllite and sandstone.  Hannegan soils are in a cold, marine climate with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Snow cover lasts from November through July.  Average annual precipitation is 90 to 110 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F, and mean July temperature is about 56 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 80 to 95 days."
