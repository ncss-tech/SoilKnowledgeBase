  "OVERVIEW": "The Hannegan series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and colluvium from phyllite and sandstone.  Hannegan soils are on glacially modified mountain shoulder slopes and have slopes of 15 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 90 to 110 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
