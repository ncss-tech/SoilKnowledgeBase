  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 40 inches. Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is below 40 inches. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid. Coarse fragments range from l0 to 35 percent in the A horizon, and 35 to 60 percent in the B and C horizons. Transitional horizons have colors and textures similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Where the value is 3, and chroma is 3 or less, the A horizon is less than 7 inches thick. Texture is gravelly silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is gravelly silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles are in shades of yellow, brown, and red. Texture in the fine earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has the same colors and texture as the B horizon. Roots extend down to the Cr horizon and grow parallel to the horizon. A few roots extend into the Cr horizon in cracks and crevasses.\nThe Cr horizon is a mixture of highly weathered siltstone and hard fractured chert beds interlayered with thin seams of silty clay loam to clay soil material. The weathered siltstone is platy to flaggy and can be dug with a spade. The chert fragments range up to l0 inches in diameter. The horizon is highly variable. It ranges from alternating strata of weathered siltstone, with or without chert, to chert beds with small intermixed areas of weathered siltstone."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Sulphura and Nashoba series are in the same family. Sulphura soils are close competitors on the landscape but have hard bedrock between 20 and 40 inches. The Nashoba soils formed in material weathered from Pennsylvanian age sandstone and commonly have greater than 15 percent coarse than very fine sand in the control section. Closely associated families include Bremo, Goldston, Hector, Manteo, Montevallo, Pickens, and Roseland series. Bremo soils have mixed mineralogy. Goldston soils developed in slaty saprolite and are shallow. Hector soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section and are in a shallow family. Manteo, Montevallo, and Pickens have mixed mineralogy and are in a shallow family. Roseland soils have an umbric epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hawthorne soils are on highly dissected hillsides and on convex rolling ridgetops. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. The soil formed in residuum of interbedded siltstone and cherty limestone. Near the type location, average annual temperature is about 60 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is about 52 inches."

Sugargrove soils are on higher positions on hillsides and ridgetops and have an argillic horizon in the subsoil and fine-loamy texture in the control section. Saffell soils are on similar landscape positions but are very deep to bedrock. Sengtown and Mountview soils are in similar landscape positions but have less than 35 percent fragments in the solum. Lax and Dickson soils are on undulating to rolling ridgetops and have a fragipan in the subsoil.  Ennis, Lobelville, and Ocana soils are on nearly level flood plains and contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments. Dellrose and Humphreys are on footslopes and have less than 35 percent fragments in the solum."
