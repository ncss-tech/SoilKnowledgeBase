  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoskinnini series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  Hoskinnini soils are on dissected pediments and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
