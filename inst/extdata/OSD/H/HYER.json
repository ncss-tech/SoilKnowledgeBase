Blanding soils have hue of 5YR or redder and receive appreciably more precipitation in the winter months. Depolvo soils have significant amounts of volcanic ash and mica in their profiles.  Nepesta soils have thick Ap horizons and have epipedons that border mollic or anthropic.  Tensleep soils have an argillic horizon less than 25 inches thick.  Wilid and Wyotite soils have hue of 10YR or yellower and are more moist in May and June."

Slopes are 1 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 14 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Harvey soils are coarse loamy, do not have an argillic horizon, and occur on south facing backslopes of undulating plains. Lazarus soils have a thick mollic epipedon and are located on the floodplains of valley floors. Palma soils are coarse-loamy and are located on north facing backslopes of undulating plains. Witt soils have a calcic horizon and are on adjacent higher areas of summits of alluvial plains."
