  "OVERVIEW": "The Hyer series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone and shale over alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Hyer soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are 1 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
