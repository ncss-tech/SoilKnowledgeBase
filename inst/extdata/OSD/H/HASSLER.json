  "REVDATE": "12/2021",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hassler series consist of deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum weathered from acid igneous rocks, primarily granite. These soils are on mountain ridgetops, lower sideslopes, and benches. Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",

Courtois soils have more clay and a higher base saturation. They occur where intermontane basins are underlain by dolomite and limestone. Delassus soils have a fragipan and are on broader summit positions. Irondale and Taumsauk soils are well drained, loamy-skeletal and are on similar landscape positions. Knobtop soils are moderately deep, fine-silty, and are on mountain ridgetops. Syenite soils are well drained, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on steeper side slopes. Trackler soils have iron depletions higher in their profiles and formed in fine-grained igneous rocks (rhyolite). They are on similar landscape positions."
