  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hassler soils are on mountain ridgetops, lower sideslopes, and benches. They formed in loamy colluvial sediments and residuum derived from acid igneous rocks, primarily granite. Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent. The mean annual temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 38 to 46 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Courtois, Delassus, Irondale, Knobtop, Syenite, Taumsauk, and Trackler series. Courtois soils have more clay and a higher base saturation. They occur where intermontane basins are underlain by dolomite and limestone. Delassus soils have a fragipan and are on broader summit positions. Irondale and Taumsauk soils are well drained, loamy-skeletal and are on similar landscape positions. Knobtop soils are moderately deep, fine-silty, and are on mountain ridgetops. Syenite soils are well drained, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on steeper side slopes. Trackler soils have iron depletions higher in their profiles and formed in fine-grained igneous rocks (rhyolite). They are on similar landscape positions."
