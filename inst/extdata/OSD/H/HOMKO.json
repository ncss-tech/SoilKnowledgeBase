  "OVERVIEW": "The Homko series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Homko soils are on strath and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
