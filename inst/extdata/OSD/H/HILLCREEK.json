  "OVERVIEW": "The Hillcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from basalt mixed with volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes range from 4 to 65 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Buckbay, Morical and Jauriga soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Georgecreek, Teewee and Wenner soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick. Mozen and Shushuskin soils are moderately deep to lithic bedrock. Pachneum soils are ashy (vitrandic features) to depths of 13 to 19 inches. Ralock and Rollinger soils contain secondary carbonates above 42 inches and are dry for 100 to 120 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Tolius soils have base saturation of 60 to 70 percent in some part above 30 inches and have C horizons with textures of loam or sandy loam above 60 inches. Vanderbilt soils have a mollic epipedon more than 60 inches thick and are dry for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Volinger soils have secondary carbonates at 43 to 60 inches. Wockum soils are dry 90 to 100 days and are ashy (vitrandic features) to depths of 7 to 12 inches."
