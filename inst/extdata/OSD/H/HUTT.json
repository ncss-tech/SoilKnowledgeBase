The mean summer temperature is 58 degrees to 65 degrees F.\nThese soils are usually calcareous throughout, but some pedons are leached a\nfew inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is clay and averages between\n60 and 70 percent clay.  Consistence is hard or very hard.  When the soil is\ndry, cracks one-half to one inch and several feet long extend downward 20\ninches or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist,\nand chroma of 1 or 2.  Dark soil color is related to the parent material weathered from bedded shale."
