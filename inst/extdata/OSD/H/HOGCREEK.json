  "OVERVIEW": "The Hogcreek series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in hillslope sediments mixed with a component of loess and the underlying colluvium. These soils are on gently sloping to moderately sloping ridgetops. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
