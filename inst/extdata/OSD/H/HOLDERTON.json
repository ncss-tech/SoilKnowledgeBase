  "OVERVIEW": "The Holderton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains. They formed in loamy alluvial deposits. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high in the mineral soil. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (46 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1080 mm (42.5 inches).",

Rock fragments, mainly gravel, range from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the surface layer, from 0 to 20 percent in the subsoil, and from 0 to 35 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the solum and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon has colors and textures similar to the B horizon. Structure is platy, or the horizon is massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, in the fine-earth fraction.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Holderton soils are nearly level and are on flood plains along low gradient streams. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in recent alluvium derived from glacial drift of Wisconsin age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 795 to 1725 cm (31 to 68 inches); mean annual air temperature ranges from 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F); and the growing season ranges from 105 to 180 days. These soils generally occur at elevations between 50 and 600 meters (164 and 1,968 feet)."

Chenango, Howard, and Valois soils are on adjacent higher gravelly terraces. Mardin, Volusia, Chautauqua and Busti soils are glacial till soils on surrounding hillsides. Raynham and Getzville soils are silty soils that occupy similar lowlands positions but are not subject to common flooding."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Holderton series was proposed for somewhat poorly drained soils previously included with the Middlebury series. The Middlebury series is now restricted to moderately well drained.\nThe original pedon from Chautauqua County, NY classified as a Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts in the 8th edition of Soil Taxonomy. In 2005 a new pedon from Allegany County, NY was substituted for the original pedon from Chautauqua County, NY because of changes in the 9th edition of Soil Taxonomy. Pedons from the 3 counties where this has been mapped in NY (Chautauqua, Cattaraugus and Allegany) classify as Fluventic Endoaquepts using the 9th edition.\nThe elevation range listed is the range that was determined through SDJR to be valid for most soils that occur in valleys across the extent of the MLRA map unit, and is not intended to represent the elevations of this series as it is currently mapped. It is anticipated that this series extent will eventually be expanded to cover the \"somewhat poorly drained\" areas previously mapped as the Middlebury series, since Middlebury series now only allows for \"moderately well drained\".\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (10 inches) (Ap horizon).\n2. Irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth and is greater than 0.2 percent within 1.25 meters (50 inches).\n3. An Aquic moisture regime - evidenced by low chroma ped face colors and redoximorphic features in the Bw2 horizon.\n4. Particle-size control section from 25 to 100 cm (10 and 39 inches) that is coarse-loamy by weighted average.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
