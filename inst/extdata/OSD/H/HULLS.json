  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.   Coarse fragments, mostly of gravel size, average 10 to 35 percent throughout the soil profile.  The soil between depths of about 6 to 18 inches usually is moist all of the time from sometime in October until sometime in mid-June and is dry all the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 52 to 57 degrees F.  The soils are medium or strongly acid and lack a consistent pattern of change with depth.  The base saturation is about 50 to 75 percent throughout.  Textures are loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam, usually with about 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is gray, grayish brown or olive gray in 2.5Y or 5Y or neutral hue.  It is very dark gray, very dark grayish brown or dark olive gray moist.  This horizon has soil structure or is only slightly hard in pedons lacking structure.  It contains 2 to 4 percent organic matter in the upper 10 inches which decreases gradually to less than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches.\nThe B horizon is light gray, light brownish gray, grayish brown, light olive gray, or olive gray.  In most pedons it has weak or moderate structure, but it is massive in some pedons.  This horizon is slightly finer textured than the A horizon, but the clay increase is less than 3 percent.  It has some micaceous coatings on peds, on rock fragments and as the lining of pores.  In addition, some pedons have a few to common thin clay films."

Crafton soils have less than 18 percent clay in the series control section.  Comptche soils have hue of 5YR or redder throughout and have mixed mineralogy.  Laughlin and Tatu soils have base saturation of more than 75 percent and have mixed mineralogy.  Tyson soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Yaxon soils have a lithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on rolling to very steep slopes at elevations of 2,000 to 6,000 feet.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from chlorite schist, metamorphosed sedimentary rock and shale.  The climate is moist subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches with some snow.  The average January temperature is about 32 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is about 130 to 150 days."
