    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Horning soils are on stable dunes on lake terraces. They formed in eolian material derived from volcanic ash and diatomite over lacustrine deposits derived from diatomite and tuff. The source of the volcanic ash is ancestral Mt. Mazama. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,304 to 1,378 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Abert and Tonor soils are ashy, have cambic horizons, and are on summit positions of lake terraces. Morehouse soils are ashy, do not have loamy textures within the particle-size control section, do not have identifiable secondary carbonates or sodium adsorption ratios greater than 13 within 100 cm of the soil surface, and are on stable dunes. Youtlkue soils are ashy, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, have cambic horizons, and are in depressions on lake terraces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A horizon and part of Bkn horizon).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 10 to 147 cm (Bkn, Bknb, Bkb1, and Bkb2 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 76 cm (A and Bkn horizons and part of the Bknb horizon).\nEntisol feature - Subsoil textures above the buried horizons are too coarse for a cambic horizon.\nBuried horizons - The zone from 66 to 147 cm (Bknb, Bkb1, and Bkb2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bknb horizon and part of the Bkn horizon).\nThe revision of April 2001 updated the taxonomic class from Mixed, frigid Xeric Torripsamments. The ashy substitute class, glassy mineralogy class, and volcanic glass content are estimated based on properties of adjacent soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon at the series type location is reference sampled for the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S94OR-037-003 (pedon # 95P0059). Selected data are available for the horizons from 4-26, 26-40, 40-48, and 58-70 inches.\nFormer editors and authors include: RPM-GJW-TDT.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
