  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the umbric epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches, thickness of solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon in the umbric epipdon ranges from 1 to 6 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent and are mostly stones.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3.  Structure is granular or crumb and consistence is soft or slightly hard.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid and the horizon is less than 50 percent base saturated.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR OR 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  The horizon usually has common distinct to prominent mottles.  Texture is typically stony sandy loam, but the fine earth fraction ranges in clay from 5 to 18 percent and sand is over 52 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely to strongly acid.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR."

The soil formed in parent materials weathered from underlying gneiss and schist bedrock or from thin glacial till overlying such rock.  At the type location the average precipitation is 20 inches which is generally uniformly distributed throughout the year.  These soils have fluctuating water tables near the surface in most seasons.  The frost-free season is about 20 days."
