  "OVERVIEW": "The Hendricks series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in local alluvium and lake sediments.  They are on alluvial fans and lake terraces with slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons is 48 to 65 inches or more. Calcareous lake sediments occur at depths below 48 inches in some pedons. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at about 20 inches depth is 65 to 68 degrees F. The cation exchange capacity/clay ratio is about 0.6 to 0.8.  The soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1.5 or 2 moist. It has 3 to 5 percent organic matter. It has weak to moderate, fine to medium granular with some medium to coarse subangular blocky structure in the lower part in some pedons. It is neutral to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is silty clay loam or clay loam, with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and with 5 to 10 percent more clay than the A horizon. It has weak to moderate, medium to coarse prismatic breaking to weak to moderate fine to medium subangular blocky structure. It is neutral to slightly acid.  It has common to continuous, thin to moderately thick clay films. A few scattered gravel or stones may occur in the lower part of the Bt horizon and C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silt loam."

Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Parent materials are mixed alluvium and lake sediments, dominantly from sandstone and quartzite rocks. The climate is moist subhumid, mean annual temperature is 44 to 48 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. The frost-free period is 120 to 140."
