  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hussa soils are on flood plains, lake terraces, basin floor remnants and inset fans. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of vitric pyroclastic materials. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. Elevations are 1,360 to 2,140 meters. The climate is cool with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 400 mm which comes mostly as snow. Mean annual temperature is 6.5 to 9 degrees C and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Barting, Fairydell, Ratto and Siri soils are well-drained. Also, Bartine soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact, Fairydell soils have a Cqk horizon, Ratto soils have an indurated duripan at depths of 30 to 61 centimeters and Siri soils have a calcic horizon and lack a mollic epipedon. Bidwell soils and Buntingville soils have argillic horizons. Four Star soils have 7 to 18 percent clay in their particle-size control sections and do not have a calcareous reaction class. Hovey soils have prominent Bk (calcic) horizons immediately underlying the mollic epipedon."
