  "OVERVIEW": "The Hussa series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of vitric pyroclastic materials. Hussa soils are on flood plains, lake terraces, basin floor remnants and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
