    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

Rock fragments in the control section average 35 to 60 percent; in the lower part they range to 80 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry. It is commonly loam but ranges to clay loam in some pedons. This horizon has moderate or strong very fine to medium granular structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 through 6. Below depth of 20 inches it has value of 4 moist in some pedons. It is loam or clay loam with more than 18 percent clay. It has weak to moderate very fine to fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon, when present, is commonly lighter colored but ranges from dark reddish brown to reddish brown when moist. It has 70 to 85 percent rock fragments by volume."

The soil formed in medium or moderately fine textured very gravelly colluvium weathered from basic volcanic rock. The climate is modified maritime climate with an annual precipitation of 60 to 80 inches and with a short dry season during the summer. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The average January temperature is 42 degrees F., and the average July temperature is 62 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 200 days."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used for timber production. Typically, the coniferous forest canopy is dominated by Douglas-fir with grand fir and Oregon oak present in small numbers. The understory is mixed shrubs and herbs with some combination of the following plants; poison-oak, salal, brackenfern, oceanspray, hazel, western dewberry, swordfern, grass and small numbers of other plants. The ocean spray-salal and vine maple-salal understory communities are common. On burned over areas, brackenfern, salal, oceanspray, hazel, and poison-oak are present in large numbers."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: With the combining of the Benton County Area, Oregon and Alsea Area, Oregon soil survey portion within Benton County into the Benton County, Oregon update soil survey, the Hatchery series has been correlated into different soil series depending upon the mapping unit in which it occurred. Where it was mapped as a consociation unit in the Alsea survey the Hatchery soils have been correlated to the Harslow series; where it was mapped in complex with the Honeygrove series the Hatchery soils have been correlated to the Shivigny series. Currently, there is still a portion of the Alsea Area survey which has not been updated, and the Hatchery series is still recognized. Further investigation is needed in this area to determine if the Hatchery soils should be inactivated.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial characterization data reported for one pedon in the Soil Survey of the Alsea Area, Oregon, October, 1973.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
