    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Sassafras series. Laboratory data indicates a base saturation (by sum of cations) greater than 35 percent on cropland areas, and a base saturation of less than 35 percent in woodland areas. Scientists believe the high base saturation in this soil has been caused by long-time cropping practices (liming), and the soil would revert to a lower base saturation if the cropland areas were converted back to woodland.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 14 to 28 inches (Bt horizon)"
