  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Sassafras series. Laboratory data indicates a base saturation (by sum of cations) greater than 35 percent on cropland areas, and a base saturation of less than 35 percent in woodland areas. Scientists believe the high base saturation in this soil has been caused by long-time cropping practices (liming), and the soil would revert to a lower base saturation if the cropland areas were converted back to woodland.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 14 to 28 inches (Bt horizon)\nSERIES INTERPRETATION RECORD(S): MD0147\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nMD0147 HAMBROOK    0- 10   52- 58  190-210  42- 48     5-40\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nMD0147 NONE          4.0-6.0  APPARENT JAN-MAY  >60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nMD0147  0-10  L SL                    0-  0  85-100 12-18   5- 10\nMD0147 10-14  L SL                    0-  0  85-100 10-18   1-  5\nMD0147 14-28  SCL SL L                0-  0  85-100 18-27   1-  5\nMD0147 28-65  LS S                    0-  0  70-100  3- 8   1-  5\nMD0147 65-72  SR FSL SICL             0-  0  70-100 15-30   1-  5\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
