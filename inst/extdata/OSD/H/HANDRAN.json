  "OVERVIEW": "The Handran series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in thick stony deposits of alluvium and glacial material and material weathered from granite, basalt, sandstone, and shale.  The Handran soils are on alluvial fans, moraines, mesa tops, and valley filling side slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 55 to 58 degrees F.  These soils have mollic epipedons ranging in thickness from 8 to 15 inches.  Organic carbon in the surface horizon ranges from .8 to 2.5 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 80 percent.  The control section is usually coarse sandy loam, but averages 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 48 to 82 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand and with a large proportion of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand.   Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are mainly more than 10 inches in diameter.  Horizons of low organic matter content have a differential between dry and moist consistence that is 1 to 3 times greater than that of soils of similar texture that have finer and more rounded sand grains.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section at some time in most years.  Bedrock is below 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe AC and C horizons have hues of 5Y through 7.5YR; subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  It ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  Textures are loam, or sandy loam."

Decram, Krackle, Middlehill, Parachute, and Supervisor soils have lithic bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Foxmount, Grafen, and Rockabin soils have paralithic bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Antrobus, Greyback, Farlow, Midelight, Midfork, and Silvercliff soils have free calcium carbonates or consistent K horizons.  Broad Canyon, Fairydell, Kamack, Maurice, Sup, Tineman, and Wareagle soils lack rock fragments that are dominantly larger than 10 inches.  The Basinpeak soils have particle-size control sections with less that 18% clay and are dominated by pebbles.  The Klug, Lag, McCort, Sebud, Thornburg, Tiban, and Timmercrek soils have a cambic horizon.  In addition, the McCort and Timmercrek soils have pebbles as the dominant rock fragment size.  The Gaia soils have lamellae in the C horizon and have gravel and cobble dominant in the particle-size control section.  The Teemat soils have a consistent K horizon at 10 to 60 inches and is calcareous ranging from 0 to 13 inches."
