  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to coprogenous earth (sedimentary peat) ranges from 16 to 51 inches. The fiber is derived primarily from herbaceous plants. Some pedons contain up to about 15 percent, by volume, woody fragments that range from 1/8 to 3 inches in diameter. In some pedons hemic soil material totaling up to as much as 10 inches in thickness is in the surface and subsurface tiers.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 3 broken face or rubbed.  The content of fiber is less than 35 percent in the undisturbed condition and less than 10 percent after rubbing.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5GY, 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 to 7 and chroma of 0 to 3.  Values of 5 or more are considered as marl and allowed in the range of the series.  Coprogenous earth has a low bulk density (0.1 to 0.5 gm/cc).  It commonly contains snail shells and in some layers the shells and fragments occupy up to 15 percent of the volume. Plant detritus comprise less than 10 percent of the volume. It ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Haslie soils are on plane or concave areas in bogs on glacial moraines, glacial outwash plains, glacial lake plains and flood plains. The bogs evolved from former area of open water. Haslie soils formed in organic material from grasses, sedges, and reeds over coprogenous earth (sedimentary peat). Slope gradients range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches. Frost-free days range from 88 to 140 days. Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet"

Rifle and Seelyeville soils do not have coprogenous earth above a depth of 51 inches.  Rondeau soils contain marl layers in the control section.  Other mineral soils are associates at the margins of bogs."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained. Surface runoff is low or very low. Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid in the sapric material and moderately slow to slow in the coprogenous earth (sedimentary peat). An apparent seasonal high water table is +1 to 0.5 feet at some time during November to July in most years.  The ponded phase has a water table at +3 to 0 feet from January to December in most years."
