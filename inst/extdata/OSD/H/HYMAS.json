  "OVERVIEW": "The Hymas series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone.  The Hymas soils are on mountainsides, ridges or uplands.  Slopes are 10 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
