Slopes are 10 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 4,500 to 8,000 feet (9,000 feet in Nevada).  The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches; mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 60 to 110 days."
