  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 to 68 degrees F. and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F. for any significant period.  The soil between depths of 8 to 24 inches is usually dry all of the time from late April until November and is usually moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or gravelly equivalents of each.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent.  The control section has little or no stratification.  Clay content usually averages 6 to 12 percent.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent, decreases regularly with increasing depth and is below 0.2 percent at a depth of 60 inches.  Some pedons have unrelated strata of sand, gravel or buried soils below depth of 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  The profile is noneffervescent to depth of 40 inches or more.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/3, 5/6, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6, 4/2, 4/4.  Moist values are generally one unit less.  This horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or gravelly equivalents of each.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/3, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/6, 6/4, 5/2, 5/4, 4/2, 4/4.  Moist values are generally one unit less."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Honcut soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans at elevations less than 2,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium dominantly from basic rocks but are derived from acid igneous rocks in some places.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F., average January temperature is about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature is about 80 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 200 to 280 days."
