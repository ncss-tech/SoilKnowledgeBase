  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  Depth to strongly cemented or indurated bedrock ranges\nfrom 5 to 9 feet or more.  Soil reaction is strongly or very\nstrongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10R through 7.5YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Some pedons have an A1 horizon that has\nhue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2.  Texture of the A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 or 4, and\nchroma of 2 through 6.  The lower part of the Bt horizon may have\nfew to common mottles in shades of brown or yellow.  Texture is\nclay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  The upper 20 inches of the B2t horizon contains 10 to 40 percent silt.\nThe B3 horizon has colors similar to the B2t horizon; or has hue\nof 2.5YR or 10R, value of 5, and chroma of 6.  Texture is fine\nsandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Reddish sandstone fragments are few to common.\nThe Cr horizon consists of weathered weakly cemented red, yellow,\nor brown sandstone with soil material filling the cracks.  Lenses\nof shale are common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hanceville soils are mostly on broad smooth plateaus, mountaintops or hilltops, but there is a small acreage\non hillsides.  Slopes are commonly 2 to 15 percent, but range from\n0 to 40 percent.  The regolith is weathered from sandstone, shale,\nor silt loam.  Climate is temperate-humid.  Near the type\nlocation, the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.,\nand the mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches."

Albertville, Hartsells, Linker, Nauvoo, Nectar, and Townley soils\nare on similar landforms and have weathered or unweathered bedrock\nat depths of 20 to 60 inches of the surface.  Cane soils are on adjacent toe slopes and have a fragipan.  Gorgas soils are on adjacent (usually steep) side slopes and are shallow to hard sandstone bedrock."
