    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist, but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperatures range from 53 to 56 degrees F. The soil is more than 60 inches deep to bedrock. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Hue is 10YR throughout. The soil has 0 to 5 percent gravel throughout. Depth to redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less is 30 inches or more. Base saturation in all or some part of the upper 30 inches is less than 75 percent (sum).\nThe Ap or A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 15 to 27 percent clay in the upper part and silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay in the lower part. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe BAt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. Reaction is typically moderately acid or slightly acid but ranges to strongly acid in the lower part.\nThe BC horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay with 25 to 45 percent clay. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Helvetia soils are on smooth or rolling, convex old terraces. Elevations are 200 to 500 feet. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The soils formed in silty glaciolacustrine deposits over old silty and clayey alluvium. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The average July temperature is 66 degrees F., average January temperature is 39 degrees F.; the average annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches. The frost free period is 165 to 210 days."

Cascade, Cornelius and Kinton soils have fragipans and are on rolling hills. Delena soils have a fragipan and are in depressions on rolling hills. Hazelair soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact and are in concave areas of hills. Laurelwood soils do not have a mollic epipedon or redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less and are on hills. Saum soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, do not have redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less and are on hills. Helmick soils do not have an argillic horizon, have more than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are on rolling hills."

(Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 48 inches (BAt, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nFurther investigation is needed to determine, if within the full extent of where this series is mapped, there is presence of redox depletions within a depth of 20 to 30 inches. If this diagnostic feature is met, this soil should be considered as an Aquultic Argixerolls.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for one pedon (S67-OR-34-6) from Oregon State University Soil Survey Laboratory.
