  "OVERVIEW": "The Hotel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone.  Hotel soils are on hills and have slopes of 30 to 100 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature ranges from 3 to 6 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 10 inches and 35 inches or bedrock is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 1 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/2 or 4/3.  Where mollic colors occur the thickness requirements for a mollic epipedon are not met.  Gravel content is 15 to 50 percent.  Cobble content is 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction is strongly through slightly acid.\nThe B horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 or 5/6.  It is very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam and may be extremely gravelly.  Clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  Gravel content is 35 to 75 percent.  Cobble content is 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid. Base saturation (sum) is 35 to 60 percent."
