  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact and thickness of the solum is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature ranges from 3 to 6 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 10 inches and 35 inches or bedrock is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 1 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/2 or 4/3.  Where mollic colors occur the thickness requirements for a mollic epipedon are not met.  Gravel content is 15 to 50 percent.  Cobble content is 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction is strongly through slightly acid.\nThe B horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 or 5/6.  It is very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam and may be extremely gravelly.  Clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  Gravel content is 35 to 75 percent.  Cobble content is 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid. Base saturation (sum) is 35 to 60 percent."

A strong coastal marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is 50 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 55 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 290 to 365 days."

Soil taxonomy Notice 8 deletes Tropudalfs and reclassifies them as Hapludalfs.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003.
