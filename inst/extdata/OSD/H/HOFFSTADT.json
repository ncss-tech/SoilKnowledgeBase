  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoffstadt series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from basic igneous rock and volcanic ash.  Hoffstadt soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops at elevations of 1,800 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 90 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils formed in colluvium from basic igneous rock including porphoritic andesite, olivine basalt and andesitic alloclastic breccia with a mantle of aerially deposited volcanic ash. Some Hoffstadt soils have a small admixture of sand and pebble-size pumice fragments in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches including snowfall.  Average annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 150 to 180 days."

The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of less than 1.00 g/cc, volcanic glass content of less than 5 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 2 percent.  Bulk density is more than 0.90 g/cc below 14 inches."
