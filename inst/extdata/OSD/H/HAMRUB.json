  "OVERVIEW": "The Hamrub soils consist of deep to a duripan, well drained soils formed in loess and silty alluvium.  Hamrub soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
