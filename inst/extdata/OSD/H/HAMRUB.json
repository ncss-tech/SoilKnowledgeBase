Kimama soils have only few patchy clay films, have cemented nodules in the Argillic horizon, and lack a duripan or bedrock contact between 40 and 60 inches.   Marley soils have fine textures in the lower part of the argillic and have buried Bt horizons."

The average annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is 85 to 120 days."
