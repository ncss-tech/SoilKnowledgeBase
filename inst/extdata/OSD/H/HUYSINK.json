They formed in material weathered from glacial till from mixed sources.  The climate is typified by warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation varies from 50 to 70 inches, some of which occurs as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 51 degrees F.  The average frost-free season varies from 100 to 150 days."
