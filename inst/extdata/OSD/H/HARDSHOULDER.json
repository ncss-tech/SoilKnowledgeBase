They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.   Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,505 to 3,245 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 500 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
