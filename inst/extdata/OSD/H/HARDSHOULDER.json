  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hardshoulder series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash. Hardshoulder soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
