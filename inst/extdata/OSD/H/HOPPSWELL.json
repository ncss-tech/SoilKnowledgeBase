  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoppswell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous sources. Hoppswell soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
