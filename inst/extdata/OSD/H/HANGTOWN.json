Cobbles and stones vary from 5 to 30 percent throughout the profile.  Mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section from about July 15 thru October 15 (90 days).  They are usually moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  These soils have ochric epipedons with chromas of 4 either at the surface or within 3 to 5 inches of the surface.  Reaction is slightly thru strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon  dry colors is 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/4, 5/3 or 6/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4; 10YR 2/2, 3/3, 3/4 or 4/3 .  It is a sandy loam or fine sandy loam, their gravelly, very gravelly or very cobbly equivalents averaging 8 to 15 percent clay, 10 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 30 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon dry color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4; 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 6/4, 6/6 or 7/4.  Moist color is 7.5 YR 3/4; 10YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6 or 5/4.  It is a sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 10 to 15 percent clay.  It is modified by 20 to 60 percent pebbles, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones.\nThe C horizons has dry colors of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, or 6/6.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3 or 4/4.

Althouse soils have textures of loam or silt loam throughout the profile.  Ardtoo soils have 2C horizons within the series control section.  Jayar, Kamela, Smokey and Umpa are all 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Minaloosa soils have Bt horizons, lack sandy loam textures and are dry for 45 to 60 days.  Treble soils have a Bo (B2ir) horizon and formed in glacial till material. These soils are Beargulch, Blankprince, Icicle, Jumpmore, notned and Standup ?????"
