All of these soils except Military and Pignut soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to bedrock. Military soils formed in sandy loam till overlying sandstone bedrock and are in areas where the mean annual precipitation is less than 914 mm (36 inches) and less than 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Pignut soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: High Gap soils are on bedrock terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy drift of Wisconsinan age. A thin layer is developed in residuum from sandstone in some pedons. Depth to hard sandstone ranges from 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches). Below the sandstone cap, the bedrock has layers of siltstone and shale in some places. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 53 degrees F)."

The Fox soils have sand and gravelly sand above a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) and are on nearby terraces. The Gosport soils formed in fine-textured shale residuum and are on steeper breaks. Miami soils formed in till and are on higher lying till plains. The somewhat poorly drained Shadeland soils are on slightly lower lying positions on bedrock terraces."
