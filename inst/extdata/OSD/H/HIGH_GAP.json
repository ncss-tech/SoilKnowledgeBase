  "STATES": "IL,IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The High Gap series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy drift. A thin layer is developed in residuum from sandstone in some pedons. The High Gap soils are on bedrock terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

All of these soils except Military and Pignut soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to bedrock. Military soils formed in sandy loam till overlying sandstone bedrock and are in areas where the mean annual precipitation is less than 914 mm (36 inches) and less than 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Pignut soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy drift of Wisconsinan age. A thin layer is developed in residuum from sandstone in some pedons. Depth to hard sandstone ranges from 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches). Below the sandstone cap, the bedrock has layers of siltstone and shale in some places. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 12 degrees C (50 to 53 degrees F)."

Miami soils formed in till and are on higher lying till plains. The somewhat poorly drained Shadeland soils are on slightly lower lying positions on bedrock terraces."
