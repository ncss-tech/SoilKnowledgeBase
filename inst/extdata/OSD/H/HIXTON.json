  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of loamy mantle, and depth to siliceous sandy residuum range from 15 to 39 inches.  Some pedons have a loess mantle up to 25 inches thick.  Depth to the paralithic contact with siliceous sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The fine-loamy part of the particle-size control section averages from 18 to 27 percent clay and from 40 to 65 percent fine sand or coarser.  Typically these soils have no coarse fragments in the upper part, but volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 35 percent and volume of sandstone flagstones ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the lower part of the loamy mantle and in the sandy residuum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where the value moist is 3, value dry is 6 or more.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap or A horizon is silt loam or loam (see remarks).  Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is like that of the Ap or A horizon described above.  Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Bt horizon typically is loam or silt loam with 18 or more percent clay, but in some pedons it is sandy loam with 18 to 20 percent clay or is sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.   It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam  or the channery analogs.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nHixton soils have a 3BC or 3C horizon, or both.\nSome pedons have a 3BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, fine sand, or the channery analogs.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3C horizon has color like the 3BC horizon described above.  It is sand, fine sand, or the channery analogs.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3Cr horizon has color like the 3BC horizon described above.  It is sandstone and is a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hixton soils are on hills on bedrock controlled uplands.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 60 percent.  Hixton soils formed in loess and/or loamy slope alluvium underlain by siliceous sandy residuum from the underlying sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1,400 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Boone, Gale, Hesch, and Norden soils.  Boone soils are nearby on landscape positions similar to those of Hixton soils where the soil is formed entirely in siliceous sandy residuum or colluvium over the sandstone.  Gale soils are nearby on similar landscape positions where there is a 20 to 40 inch thick loess mantle.  Hesch soils are on similar landscape positions where the surface layer is thicker and darker colored.  Norden soils are on similar landscape positions where the underlying sandstone is glauconitic."
