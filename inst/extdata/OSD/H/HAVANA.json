  "BYREV": "Rev. JFC-HRF-ELB",
  "REVDATE": "02/2011",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Havana series consists of deep poorly drained soils that formed in a mantle of loess or loamy sediments and loamy calcareous glacial till on ground moraines.  These soils have moderately slow permeability. Their slopes are less than 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to free carbonates is 36 to 66 inches.  Havana soils formed in loess or loamy erosional sediments that are 14 to 24 inches thick and in the underlying glacial till.  The upper sediments lack or have less than 2 percent coarse fragments and the glacial till has 2 to 8 percent of coarse fragments of mixed lithology.  A coarser textured layer or stone line as much as 5 inches in thickness is between the two sediments in some pedons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.   The A horizon typically is silt loam with 50 to 70 percent silt but ranges to loam with as little as 45 percent slopes.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically has few through many mottles.  It is medium acid or slightly acid.  Textures are like that for the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizons in both sediments have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  They have few through many mottles.  The Bt horizon in the upper sediment is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam high in silt.  The 2Bt horizon typically is clay loam or loam but a coarser textured subhorizon is in some pedons.  The Bt horizon in the upper sediment is medium or slightly acid, and the 2Bt horizon is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has 2.5Y hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma dominantly of 4 through 6 with some 2.  It commonly has secondary limy masses in the upper part.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ilion, Mermill, Olmsted, Orio, and Varick soils in the same family.  Ilion soils have thinner sola formed in calcareous gray shale.  Mermill soils have formed in stratified lacustrine sediments and have fine textured 2C horizons beginning at depths of less than 40 inches.  Olmsted soils have less silt in the upper sola and 10 to 30 percent shale and sandstone gravels throughout their sola.  Orio soils have more sand and less silt in the upper solum.   Varick soils have shale bedrock within a depth of 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in a thin mantle of loess or loamy erosional sediments and friable glacial till.  These deposits are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 27 to 32 inches."
