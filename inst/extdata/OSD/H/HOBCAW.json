  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is very strongly acid to\nslightly acid in the solum and extremely acid to neutral in the Cg horizon.  Few to common fine flakes of mica or fine black minerals are in the lower part of the B and C horizons of some pedons.  The mineralogy of the clay fraction is mixed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value\nof 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  The E horizon, where present,\nhas hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 3 to 7, and\nchroma of 0 to 2.  The A and E horizons are loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or the mucky analogues of these textures.\nThe AB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 2\nto 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow,\nor red range from few to many in most pedons.  It is sandy clay\nloam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons, less than 6 inches thick, of sandy clay.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Mottles in shades\nof red, brown, yellow, or gray range from few to many in most\npedons.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.\nThe 2Cg or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 5Y, 5GY, 5G, or it is neutral, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Mottles in shades\nof gray, brown, yellow, or red are in most pedons.  In some pedons the Cg horizon is mottled in these colors.  Texture is variable, ranging from sand to stratified clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include Paxville series in the same\nfamily and Bayboro, Byars, Cape Fear, Deloss, Hyde, Lumbee,\nPantego, Pocomoke, Portsmouth, and Rains series in similar\nfamilies.  Paxville soils have clay mineralogy dominated by kaolinite.  Bayboro, Byars, and Cape Fear soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, Bayboro and\nCape Fear soils, along with Deloss and Hyde soils, have mixed mineralogy.  Lumbee, Pocomoke, and Portsmouth soils have a thinner solum.  Pantego and Rains soils do not have a clay decrease of 20 percent or more within 60 inches of the surface."

Near the type\nlocation the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is about 51 inches; and freeze-free season is about 243 days."

Cape Fear and Bladen\nsoils are on adjacent landscapes and are clayey.  Chipley,\nChisolm, Coosaw, Seabrook, Williman, Yauhannah, and Yemassee soils are on higher landscapes and have an ochric epipedon."
