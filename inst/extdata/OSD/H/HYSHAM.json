  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Hysham soils are usually dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches when soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is warmer than 41 degrees F. but they are not dry in all parts above 12 inches for more than 1/2 the time during this period.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 50 degrees F.  Hue is 10YR through 5Y.  The materials between depths of 10 to 40 inches are loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  The A1 horizon has value of 5 or less dry and 3 or less moist.  A thin incipient A2 horizon is present in some pedons.  The B2 horizon ranges from weak medium or coarse columnar to weak medium or coarse blocky structure with very hard or extremely hard consistence.  In some pedons there are coatings of brown as streaks or bands on the surfaces of the peds.  In some pedons there are mycelial segregations of both lime and salts."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arvada, Barnum, Bone, Haverson, San Mateo and Vananda series.  Arvada and Bone soils have distinct horizonation with albic and natric horizons and have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Barnum soils have hue of 5YR or 10R in the C horizon.  Haverson soils lack very strong alkaline reaction or compact and hard consistence of subsurface horizons and they do not have a crusted surface in cultivated fields.  San Mateo soils are moderately alkaline.  Vananda soils have more than 35 percent clay."

The climate is cool semiarid with mean annual temperature ranging from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranging from 10 to 14 inches."

Heldt soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section and have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the subsoil.  Lohmiller soils are fine textured, light colored soils of the valley bottom lands.  McRae soils have cambic horizons and Cca horizons."
