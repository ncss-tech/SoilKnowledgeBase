  "OVERVIEW": "The Hollomex series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous and gypsiferous sediments.  The soils are on hillslopes, valley floors, and terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
