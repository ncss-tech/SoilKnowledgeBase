  "OVERVIEW": "The Half Dome series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or till derived from granitoid rocks. These soils are on mountain slopes, mountainsides, moraines, mountain valleys, and drainageways. Slope is 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F. (11.7 degrees C).",
