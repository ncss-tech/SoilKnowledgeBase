These soils formed in colluvium and/or till derived from granitoid rocks. Elevation is 3,793 to 6,525 feet (1,156.0 to 1,988.9 meters). The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 43 inches (889 to 1,092 millimeters), some of which falls as snow. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F (8.9 to 13.0 degrees C). The mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F (2.2 degrees C). The mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F (22.2 degrees C). The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
