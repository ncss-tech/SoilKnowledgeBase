    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hooten soils are on lake terraces and beach terraces.  Slope shapes are linear to slightly convex.  These soils formed alluvium derived from basaltic rocks over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1189 to 1280 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
