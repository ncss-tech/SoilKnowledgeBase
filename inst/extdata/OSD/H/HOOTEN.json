  "OVERVIEW": "The Hooten series consists of very shallow to a duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basaltic rocks over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Hooten soils and are on lake terraces and beach terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 127 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
