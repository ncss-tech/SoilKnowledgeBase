They depart from the concept of Emmet soils by having a glossic horizon and by forming in dense basal till.\nThe well drained phase is no longer in the concept of this series. This will become a new series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Records: MI0522 (WELL DRAINED), MI0521 (MODERATELY WET).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
