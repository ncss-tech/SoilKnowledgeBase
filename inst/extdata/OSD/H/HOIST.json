  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoist series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep to dense till. Hoist soils are formed in till and are on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).",

They depart from the concept of Emmet soils by having a glossic horizon and by forming in dense basal till.\nThe well drained phase is no longer in the concept of this series. This will become a new series."
