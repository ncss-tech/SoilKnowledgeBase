These soils formed in gravelly sediments derived from rocks such as granite and monzonite.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 10 to 15 inches with a marked summer maximum.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 57 to 66 degrees F."

Berino, Bucklebar, Caralampi, Onite, and Pinaleno soils have argillic horizons and do not have mollic epipedons.  Also, Berino soils have fine-loamy control sections and have calcic horizons within a depth of 40 inches; Bucklebar soils are fine-loamy.  Caralampi, Pinaleno, and Santo Tomas soils are skeletal.  Aladdin soils are coarse-loamy."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 8 inches (A1, A2 horizons)\nThis series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nRecent evidence in Arizona and Texas suggests soils within this precipitation zone and MLRA are moist in some part of the mollic epipedon less than 90 days (cumulative) and therefore do not meet the moisture requirements for a mollic epipedon.  An alternative subgroup is the Ustic Torriorthents.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from pedon S59 N Mex 7-2 (L.H. Gile and R.B. Grossman. 1979. The Desert Project Soil Monograph. Document PB80-135304. National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA.) support the classification.  The typifying pedon is the sample pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
