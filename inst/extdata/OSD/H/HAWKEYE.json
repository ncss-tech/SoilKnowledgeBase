  "OVERVIEW": "The Hawkeye series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite and monzonite.  Hawkeye soils are on alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

Also, Berino soils have fine-loamy control sections and have calcic horizons within a depth of 40 inches; Bucklebar soils are fine-loamy.  Caralampi, Pinaleno, and Santo Tomas soils are skeletal.  Aladdin soils are coarse-loamy."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 0 to 8 inches (A1, A2 horizons)\nThis series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nRecent evidence in Arizona and Texas suggests soils within this precipitation zone and MLRA are moist in some part of the mollic epipedon less than 90 days (cumulative) and therefore do not meet the moisture requirements for a mollic epipedon.  An alternative subgroup is the Ustic Torriorthents."
