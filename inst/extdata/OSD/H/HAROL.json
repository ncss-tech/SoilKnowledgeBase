  "OVERVIEW": "The Harol series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from basic and intermediate igneous and sedimentary rocks. Harol soils occur on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches (381 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F (5.0 degrees C).",
