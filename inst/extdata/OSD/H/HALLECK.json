Downata soils have Bg horizons with Hue that are 2.5Y or N and 2Agb horizons with Hue that is 2.5Y, 5Y or N.  Hidewood formed in loess over glacial till. Inkom soils have a mollic epipedon that is 60 to 80 cm thick and Bg horizons with Hue that are 2.5Y, 5Y or N. Homefield have a 2C horizon with 40 to 60 percent clay and textures of clay or silty clay. Lamoure soils have a high water table at a depth of 60 to 150 cm from October to June and are moist in the moisture control section from June to October following the recession of the water table. Opie soils have A horizons that are strongly or very strongly alkaline. Playmoor soils have salt accumulations (4 to 16 mm per cm) in the upper 50 cm of the soil.  Rauville soils have a granular mollic epipedon and a high water table at a depth of 0 to 60 cm throughout the year."

Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,525 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
