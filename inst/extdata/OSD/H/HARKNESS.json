  "OVERVIEW": "The Harkness series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes.  They formed in mixed colluvium from a variety of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks, dominantly sandstone and quartzite.  Slopes range from 20 to 50 percent.  Permeability is slow. Average annual precipitation is 27 inches and the average annual temperature is 37 degrees F.",

The average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 32 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 35 to 39 degrees F.  The frost-free period is less than 50 days.

The Beaverdam, Toponce, and Broadhead soils have mollic epipedons.  Hades soils have a mollic epipedon and a fine-loamy control section. Mikesell soils have moist color value of 4 or more in their upper horizons, after mixing to a depth of 6 inches.  Sedgway soils have a mollic epipedon and a loamy-skeletal control section. Valmar soils have a mollic epipedon, a loamy-skeletal control section, and have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Beaverdam soils occur on similar landforms at lower elevations and slightly warmer and drier positions.  Broadhead soils occur on footslopes and fan terraces at lower elevations and generally have slopes of less than 30 percent. Hades and Valmar soils are on south and west-facing mountainslopes.  Mikesell soils are found in concave positions on the same landscape as Harkness.  Sedgway soils occupy nearby landscapes and are generally higher on the slope near the shoulder or in convex slope positions.  Toponce soils are on footslopes at the lower limit of the elevation range of Harkness and generally have slopes less than 30 percent."
