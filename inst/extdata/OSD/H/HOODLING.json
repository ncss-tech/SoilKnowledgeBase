  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoodling series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or outwash.  Hoodling soils are on scarps on dissected pediments or outwash terraces.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
