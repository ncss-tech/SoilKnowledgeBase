  "OVERVIEW": "The Hogback series consists of shallow, well drained soils on glaciated uplands. They formed in loamy till. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high throughout the mineral soil. Slope ranges from 3 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 10 to 20 inches. Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the soil, but some pedons are moderately acid just above the bedrock. Rock fragments are mostly gravel, channers or cobbles and range from 5 to 34 percent throughout the mineral soil. The spodic horizon is 4 to 18 inches thick.\nThe O horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR or it is neutral, value of 2, 2.5, or 3, and chroma of 1. It ranges from slightly decomposed to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2, 2.5, or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is 0 to 7 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 3 or less. Some pedons have Bh horizons that have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR or are neutral and have value and chroma of 2.5 or less. Some pedons have a Bs horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, with value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 6. The B horizon is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. B horizons range from non-smeary to moderately smeary.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4.\nBedrock is slightly weathered schist, gneiss, phyllite, granite, or anorthosite."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. The Classification and location of the typical pedon are changed with this revision. The former classification was Loamy, isotic, frigid Lithic Haplorthods. Recent laboratory data from Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York shows that some pedons mapped as Hogback (and some mapped as Lyman) meet the requirements of the Humods suborder.\n2. These soils were originally recognized as having some \"thixotropic-like\" properties, i.e., smeariness, high organic carbon content, high effective clay percentage, high K value, and fragile nature (easily damaged by use) but have been classified as Orthods based on available laboratory data.\n3. The diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (O and E horizons).\nb. Spodic horizon - the zone from 8 to 19 inches (Bhs horizon).\nc. Lithic feature - bedrock at 15 inches from the mineral soil surface."
