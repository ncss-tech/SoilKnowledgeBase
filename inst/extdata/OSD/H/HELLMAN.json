The soil is dry throughout between a depth of 7 to 21 inches from June to October in most years, and is moist throughout from December to May.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  Clay content of the argillic horizon increases with depth an is greater than 35 percent throughout.  The soil has 0 to 20 percent gravel throughout.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent (sum) in some part of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/3; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 5YR 5/4, or 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 5YR 3/3, or 3/4.  The upper part has moist value of 3.  It has 20 to 25 percent clay content.  It is slightly or moderately acid.  Organic matter content is 1 to 3 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/8; 5YR 5/8, or 6/6.

It is clay loam or clay or their gravelly equivalents with 35 to 55 percent clay content.  It is slightly acid to extremely acid, becoming more acid with depth.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.  It has dry colors 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, or 6/4.  It has moist colors 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, or 5/6.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bapos (T), Benridge and Honker series.  Bapos soils have slightly to strongly alkaline Bt horizons with 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate.  Benridge soils are influenced by amorphous material and are weakly or moderately smeary in the Bt horizon.  Honker soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact and have an abrupt A/Bt boundary."
