    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer; udic or perhaps perudic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to 100 centimeters has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 6 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 30 to 50 percent for air-dried samples.  Acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  The particle-size control section has 18 to 25 percent field estimated clay with 20 to 35 percent hard gravel and cobbles and 15 to 40 percent paragravels.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. This horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure. It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  It has 12 to 40 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw1 and Bw2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and 4 through 6 dry. This horizon has angular blocky or subangular blocky structure. It is strongly acid or moderately acid.  It has 5 to 12 percent organic matter with over 7 percent throughout the upper 20 inches of the mineral soil surface.\nThe Bw3 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 4 through 6. It is gravelly medial loam or very gravelly medial loam. It is strongly acid or moderately acid.  It has 1 to 5 percent organic matter."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from Eocene age basalt of the Crescent formation.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers. Mean annual precipitation is 100 to 140 inches. Average January temperature is 34 degrees F., average July temperature is 55 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. The frost-free season (28 degrees F.) is 150 to 180 days."
