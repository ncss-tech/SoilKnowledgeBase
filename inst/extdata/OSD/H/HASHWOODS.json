  "STATES": "CA,NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hashwoods series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from andesite over residuum weathered from tuff or tuff-breccia.  Hashwoods soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",

They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from andesite over residuum weathered from tuff or tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,660 to 2,445 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.  These soils receive additional moisture from adjacent areas."
