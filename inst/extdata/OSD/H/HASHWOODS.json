  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hashwoods soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on north-facing middle to upper, concave backslope positions.  They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium derived from andesite over residuum weathered from tuff or tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,660 to 2,445 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days.  These soils receive additional moisture from adjacent areas."
