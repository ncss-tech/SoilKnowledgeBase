  "OVERVIEW": "The Harlequin series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift overlying residuum.  Harlequin soils are found on slopes of 0 to 85 percent on valley walls, ridges and cirques of glaciated mountain landscapes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2350 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",

Perfect and Stetattle soils are very deep (greater than 150 cm to a lithic contact) and have sandy-skeletal particle size control sections.  Stetattle soils have an umbric epipedon and andic soil materials greater than 90 cm thick.
