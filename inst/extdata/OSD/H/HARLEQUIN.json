    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harlequin soils are found on slopes of 0 to 85 percent on valley walls, ridges and cirques of glaciated mountain landscapes at elevations above 1,300 meters.  They formed in colluvium from glacial drift overlying residuum.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,950 to 2,700 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 0 to 4 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days."

Doubtful soils are moderately deep (50 to 100 cm) to a lithic contact and have an ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle size control section.  Perfect and Stetattle soils are very deep (greater than 150 cm to a lithic contact) and have sandy-skeletal particle size control sections.  Stetattle soils have an umbric epipedon and andic soil materials greater than 90 cm thick.  Treen soils have a medial particle size control section and andic soil properties throughout the soil profile."
