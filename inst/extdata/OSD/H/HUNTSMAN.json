  "OVERVIEW": "The Huntsman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  Huntsman soils are in drainageways and on flood-plain steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
