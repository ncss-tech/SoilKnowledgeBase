  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness commonly is 14 to 32 inches but can range up to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet.  Gravel content ranges from a trace to 35 percent by volume in the solum, and from 10 to 65 percent in the 2C horizon.  Cobble and content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout and stone content ranges from 0 to 40 percent throughout.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid in the solum and slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap or A1 horizons have hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, with a value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are sandy loam, loam or their gravelly and cobbly analogues.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon with hues and chroma similar to the A horizon but with values of 4 or 5.\nThe Bt horizon has hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is sandy loam or their gravelly and cobbly analogues with 8 to 14 percent clay.  It ranges from weak to strong fine to coarse subangular blocky structure. Consistence ranges from friable to firm.\nSome pedons have a thin BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hues of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, values of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture ranges from coarse sand to loamy sand and gravelly analogues.  They are either massive or single grained and loose or friable."

They formed in stratified glacial deposits dominated by slate, shale and sandstone but contain some limestone.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 54 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 140 to 160 days."

Colonie soils are sandy and have thicker sola and occur in some places. The somewhat excessively drained Hoosic soils have less rock fragments, are coarser textured and are on similar landscapes. Fredon, Halsey and Hero soils are in depressions or broad flat areas and are wet associates with gray redoximorphic features or gray matrix colors in the subsoil.  The somewhat excessively drained Otisville soils are sandy and are on similar landscapes. Palmyra soils have fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal textural control sections."

Flooding frequency ranges from none on the more sloping areas to rare on some nearly level areas adjacent to streams."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This revision reflects a new type location.  Investigations of this soil indicate that it does not meet contrasting particle size class criteria in Soil Taxonomy (Second Edition-1999). Because of the lack of an illuvial horizon, the determination of an argillic horizon is based upon the identification of evidence of clay illuviation, in the form of clay films and bridging (Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999).\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Mollic epipedon - the zone from 1 to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 18 inches (Bt horizon).\n3. Particle size class: the zone from 10 to 18 inches averages less than 18 percent clay\n4. Cation exchange class: based upon a review of characterization data.\n5. Characterization data for referenced samples indicates base saturation typically is more than 50 percent in the epipedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples from pedons 91P0651, 91P0652, and 91P0653, samples 91P3175-3723, 91P3724-3726, and 91P3727-3735 from Warren County, New Jersey, samples by NSSL, Lincoln, NE, 5/91\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
