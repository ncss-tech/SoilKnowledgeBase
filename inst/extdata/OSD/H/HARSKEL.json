  "OVERVIEW": "The Harskel series consists of shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks high in volcanic ash. Harskel soils are on plateaus. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
