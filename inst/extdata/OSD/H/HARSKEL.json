    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harskel soils are on plateaus. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff and similar volcanic rocks with a high content of volcanic ash. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 5,310 to 6,930 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches, mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
