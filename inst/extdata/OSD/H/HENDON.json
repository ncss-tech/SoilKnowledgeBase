  "OVERVIEW": "The Hendon series consists of deep, well drained, nearly level to sloping soils that formed in a loamy mantle 18 to 30 inches thick that is higher in silt content than the underlying loamy residuum that weathered from interbedded flat-lying sandstone, siltstone and shale.  These soils are on broad interfluves of the Cumberland Plateau and have a fragic layer in the subsoil.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.",

Fragments of sandstone and shale up to 1/2 inch across range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and upper part of the B horizon, and 0 to 10 percent in the lower part of the B horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2.  The E horizon or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 5 or 6 and chromas of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nA BE horizon is present in some pedons and has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 and chromas of 4 or 6.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon and upper part of the 2Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam loam, or clay loam.

Texture is loam or clay loam.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or red are present in the 2B horizons of most pedons.  Gray mottles occur in a few pedons below a depth of 30 inches."

Clarkrange soils are fine-silty and have a fragipan.  Dunlap soils are on stream terraces and are thermic.  Shack and Tasso soils are thermic and contain chert fragments.  Lonewood soils do not have a fragic layer and have a thinner solum."

Data is also available from the control section of two additional pedons:  S84TN-007-008 and S84TN-007-009.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface 01 the soil to a depth of approximately 10 inches (A, E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 10 to 65 inches (Bt1 through 2Bt horizon)\nFragic feature - the zone with 40 to 60 percent brittleness from and 2Btx/E horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
