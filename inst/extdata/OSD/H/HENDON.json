    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid in limed areas.  Fragments of sandstone and shale up to 1/2 inch across range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and upper part of the B horizon, and 0 to 10 percent in the lower part of the B horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2.  The E horizon or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 5 or 6 and chromas of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nA BE horizon is present in some pedons and has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 and chromas of 4 or 6.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon and upper part of the 2Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam loam, or clay loam.  The E part has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Btx and 2Bt horizons have hues of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, values of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or red are present in the 2B horizons of most pedons.  Gray mottles occur in a few pedons below a depth of 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other soils in this family.  Similar soils in other families include Clarkrange, Dunlap, Lonewood, Shack and Tasso soils.  Clarkrange soils are fine-silty and have a fragipan.  Dunlap soils are on stream terraces and are thermic.  Shack and Tasso soils are thermic and contain chert fragments.  Lonewood soils do not have a fragic layer and have a thinner solum."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hendon soils are on broad smooth plateaus and ridgetops.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  These soils formed in a loamy mantle 18 to 30 inches thick that is higher in silt content than the underlying loamy residuum that weathered from interbedded flat-lying sandstone, siltstone and shale.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 53 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY  ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY  ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Lonewood series and the Lily and Ramsey series.  Lily soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock do not have a fragic layer.  Ramsey soils are commonly on steeper slopes, are less than 20 inches to bedrock and do not have an argillic horizon."
