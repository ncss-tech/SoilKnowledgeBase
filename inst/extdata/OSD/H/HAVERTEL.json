  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon  ranges from 10 to 18 inches.  Depth to a fluctuating water table ranges from 3 to 5 feet.  Depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 14 to 34 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly or strongly effervescent. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline (pH 7.3 to 8.4).\nThe AC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Mottles may be present in irrigated areas. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is moderately or strongly effervescent.   Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 7.9 to 9.0).\nThe 2C1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Mottles may be present in irrigated areas. Texture is gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sand.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Sands are predominantly arkosic.  It is moderately or strongly effervescent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 7.9 to 9.0).\nThe 2C2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is very gravelly sand or extremely gravelly sand.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 35 to 70 percent.  Sands are predominantly arkosic.  Few thin strata of red silt are common in some pedons.  It is typically noneffervescent, but some pedons may be slightly effervescent.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline (pH 7.4 to 8.4)."

Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations are 3,800 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is cool and semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 19 inches, about half of which falls in April, May, and June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 110 to 120 days."
