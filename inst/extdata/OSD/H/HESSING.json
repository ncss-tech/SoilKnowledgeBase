  "OVERVIEW": "The Hessing series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash. Hessing soils are on beach plains, fan skirts, inset fans, and lagoons. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Potential competitors in similar families are the Lusetti, and Wingrock series.\nAll of these soils, except Embudo, average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Koyen and Monue soils do not have sandy-skeletal material within 100 cm and are more moist in summer months. Embudo soils have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 15 degrees C.  Quima soils do not have sandy-skeletal material within 100 cm and have moderate amounts of mica in the particle-size control section. Unionville soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts of weathered granitic rock. Wall soils do not have sandy-skeletal material within 100 cm."
