    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Embudo, Koyen, Monue, Quima, Unionville, and Wall series.  Potential competitors in similar families are the Lusetti, and Wingrock series.\nAll of these soils, except Embudo, average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Koyen and Monue soils do not have sandy-skeletal material within 100 cm and are more moist in summer months. Embudo soils have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 15 degrees C.  Quima soils do not have sandy-skeletal material within 100 cm and have moderate amounts of mica in the particle-size control section. Unionville soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts of weathered granitic rock. Wall soils do not have sandy-skeletal material within 100 cm."

Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,463 to 1,830 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
