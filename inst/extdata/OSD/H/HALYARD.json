  "OVERVIEW": "The Halyard series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in materials weathered from basalt, andesite and breccia. Halyard soils are on hills and mountains on islands. Slopes range from 2 to 85 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F. (19 degrees C.)",
