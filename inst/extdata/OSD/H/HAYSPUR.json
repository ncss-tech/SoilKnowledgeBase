  "STATES": "ID,NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hayspur series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on floodplains and drainageways. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part and rapid in the underlying material. These soils formed mainly in recent stratified alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slope ranges from O to 2 percent. The average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hayspur soils are on level or very gently undulating or channeled floodplains and drainageways. Slope ranges from O to 2 percent. The soils formed in recent stratified alluvium over older sand and gravel alluvium, derived from mixed sources. Elevations are 5,260 to 5,600 feet. The climate is semiarid, with an average annual temperature of 43 to 45 degrees F, and average annual precipitation of 13 to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow and spring rain. The average frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
