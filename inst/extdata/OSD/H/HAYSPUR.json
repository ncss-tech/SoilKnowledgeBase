  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hayspur soils are on level or very gently undulating or channeled floodplains and drainageways. Slope ranges from O to 2 percent. The soils formed in recent stratified alluvium over older sand and gravel alluvium, derived from mixed sources. Elevations are 5,260 to 5,600 feet. The climate is semiarid, with an average annual temperature of 43 to 45 degrees F, and average annual precipitation of 13 to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow and spring rain. The average frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Paynecreek soils are on higher terraces, are well drained, and-have gravelly textures. Zola soils are moderately well drained and do not have sand and gravel within 60 inches."
