  "OVERVIEW": "The Herd series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in glacial till from conglomerate deposited over material weathered from sandstone.  These soils are on mountain tops and ridges.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees.",

The upper boundary of the 2Bt horizon occurs at depths of 13 to 24 inches.  The combined thickness of the A and 2Bt horizon ranges from 50 to more than 60 inches over bedrock or underlying C horizon.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 41 to 44 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 54 to 59 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 30 to 45 days during the late summer.  Rock fragments consist of rounded quartzite pebbles and cobbles, and range from 15 to 35 percent in the A horizon.  The 2Bt horizon has 0 to 20 percent soft sandstone pebbles and cobbles.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry. 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  The A2 and A3 horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 6 moist and they have either moist chroma or moist value of 4 or more in all parts.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry and moist, and chroma of 4 through 8 dry, 3 through 8 moist.  Texture ranges from clay to silty clay or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

The climate is humid and the averge annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 42 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F., and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 65 days."
