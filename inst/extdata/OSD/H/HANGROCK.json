  "OVERVIEW": "The Hangrock series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and vitric pyroclastic materials.  Hangrock soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
