  "OVERVIEW": "The Holmes series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Holmes soils are on stream terraces, fan terraces, and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Clanalpine, Hoskin, Moreypeak, Suak, Valmar and Vitale soils are also less than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Horrocks and Hoskin soils have very cobbly sandy clay loam Bt horizons and lack underlying horizons that are very gravelly coarse sand or coarse sandy loam. Heechee, Howcan and Pequop do not have sand or loamy sand textures within a depth of 40 inches.  Wambolt soils have 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section."

Slopes are 1 to 15  percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous parent rocks.  The climate is moist subhumid with an average precipitation of 14 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and a mean summer temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F.

The Cation Exchange Activity Class is based on Utah State University lab data from 1960.  The series has been correlated with Upland and Mountain ecological sites in Utah.  In future correlation's the concept should be confined to the \"Typic Xeric\" concept in zones with about 16 to 22 inches of precipitation and correlated with Mountain ecological sites."
