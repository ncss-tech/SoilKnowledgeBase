Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles but some are stones.\nThe mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 63 degrees F.  The soils are are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very gravelly loam, very cobbly clay loam or very stony sandy clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent.  It is slightly alkaline to medium acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  Clay content is 2 to 5 percent.

Clanalpine, Hoskin, Squawtip, Suak, Valmar and Vitale soils are also less than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Horrocks and Hoskin soils have very cobbly sandy clay loam Bt horizons and lack underlying horizons that are very gravelly coarse sand or coarse sandy loam. Heechee, Howcan and Pequop do not have sand or loamy sand textures within a depth of 40 inches.  Wambolt soils have 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Elevations range from 4,900 to 7,500 feet.  Holmes soils occur on gently sloping to sloping stream terraces, fan terraces, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 1 to 15  percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous parent rocks.  The climate is moist subhumid with an average precipitation of 14 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and a mean summer temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is about 65 to 100 days."

Deer Creek, Manila and Nebeker soils have a fine particle-size control section.  Rasband soils have a fine-loamy over fragmental particle-size control section."

The Cation Exchange Activity Class is based on Utah State University lab data from 1960.  The series has been correlated with Upland and Mountain ecological sites in Utah.  In future correlation's the concept should be confined to the \"Typic Xeric\" concept in zones with about 16 to 22 inches of precipitation and correlated with Mountain ecological sites.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
