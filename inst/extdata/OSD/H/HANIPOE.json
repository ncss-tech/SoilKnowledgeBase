The soils are on all hillslope profile positions of undulating ash fields that overlie 11,000 to 300,000 year old lava flows.  The dominant slope range is from 6 to 20 percent, with some slopes less than 6.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash.  The mean annual rainfall is 762 to 1270 millimeters (30 to 50 inches). Cloud cover and fog are common.  The mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F) and the mean annual soil temperature is 14 degrees C (57 degrees F)."

Umikoa soils occur at lower elevation, have soil temperature of 16 degrees C (61 degrees F) (isothermic soil temperature), and have silt loam surface texture. Lanapohaku soils are ashy throughout the control section. Pohakulehu soils are on narrow, rocky ridges that intersect Hanipoe soils on 11,000 to 64,000 year old lava flows."
