    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum ranges in thickness from 40 inches to more than 5 feet. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick. The mean annual soil temperature is about 43 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at 20 inches is about 59 to 65 F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for more than 60 consecutive days in all parts of the soil between 4 and 12 inches in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The upper portion of the A horizon has moderate to strong, medium to fine granular structure or moderate medium, thin platy structure and the lower portion of the Al horizon ranges from weak medium to fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is gravelly heavy clay loam to gravelly clay with 20 to 35 percent cobble and gravel. This horizon has moderate to strong prismatic parting to angular blocky structure. Splotches of lime may occur in pockets of disintegrating rocks at depths of below 36 inches in the Bt horizon. The horizon is neutral or slightly acid and the matrix is noncalcareous. A weak lime horizon occurs at depths of 5 feet or more in some pedons. The Bt horizon extends to depths of 48 inches or more. The C horizons are cobbly, very cobbly or very gravelly clay loams containing less clay than the Bt horizon."

Broadhead and Henefer soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick. Cloud Rim soils have less than 20 percent coarse fragments and less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizons. Deer Creek soils have 30 to 65 percent lime in the Cca horizon. Horrocks soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments and less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Manila soils have less than 20 percent coarse fragments in the argillic horizon within 40 inches of the surface. Rob Roy soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Yeates Hollow soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments. Harkers Series\n2"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING: Harkers soils are on short to long sloping alluvial fans to very steep mountain slopes at elevations between 5,500 and 7,500 feet.  Slope gradients are 6 to 50 percent. The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed sedimentary rocks. The climate is moist subhumid.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is about 64 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches coming mostly as snow. The frost-free period is less than 100 days.\nPrincipal Associated Soils: These are the Copperton, Deer Creek, Dry Creek, Gappmayer, Lucky Star, and Wallsburg soils and the competing Broahead, Horrocks, and Yeates Hollow soils. Copperton soils lack B horizons, have mean annual soil temperatures more than 47 degrees F. and have lime accumulations within 40 inches. Deer Creek soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 40 inches. Dry Creek soils have mean annual soil temperature of more than 47 degrees F. and have calcic horizons within depths of 40 inches. Gappmayer soils have albic horizons. Lucky Star soils have mean summer soil temperature at 20 inches of less than 59 degrees F. Wallsburg soils are less than 20 inches deep over bedrock."
