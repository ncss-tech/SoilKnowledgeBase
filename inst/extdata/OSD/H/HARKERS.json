  "OVERVIEW": "The Harkers series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed sedimentary rocks.  The Harkers soils are on alluvial fans and mountain slopes and have slopes of 6 to 50 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F (7 degrees C) and mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches (570 mm)",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Harkers soils have very dark grayish brown, neutral, loam A horizons, and brown, neutral, gravelly clay Bt horizons over very gravelly clay loam Bk horizons. The solum ranges in thickness from 40 inches (100 cm) to more than 5 feet (150 cm). The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 cm) thick. The mean annual soil temperature is about 43 to 47 degrees F (6 to 8 degrees C) and the mean summer temperature at 20 inches (50 cm) is about 59 to 65 F (15 to 18 degrees C). The soils are usually moist but are dry for more than 60 consecutive days in all parts of the soil between 4 and 12 inches (10 to 30 cm) in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nHarkers soils have very dark grayish brown, neutral, loam A horizons, and brown, neutral, gravelly clay Bt horizons over very gravelly clay loam Bk horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The upper portion of the A horizon has moderate to strong, medium to fine granular structure or moderate medium, thin platy structure and the lower portion of the A horizon ranges from weak medium to fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bt horizon(s) has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is gravelly heavy clay loam to gravelly clay with 20 to 35 percent cobble and gravel. This horizon has moderate to strong prismatic parting to angular blocky structure. Splotches of lime may occur in pockets of disintegrating rocks at depths of below 36 inches (91 cm) in the Bt horizon. The horizon is neutral or slightly acid and the matrix is noncalcareous. A weak lime horizon occurs at depths of 5 feet or more in some pedons. The Bt horizon extends to depths of 48 inches (122 cm) or more. The Bk horizons are cobbly, very cobbly or very gravelly clay loams containing less clay than the Bt horizon."
