  "OVERVIEW": "The Highpark series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from volcanic breccia.  These soils are on bedrock controlled knobs.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
