    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth\nto the 2Cd horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon\nis 10 to 20 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature\nis 47 to 50 degrees F.  The soils are dry in all parts\nbetween depths of 4 to 12 inches for over half the time (cumulative) during the period the soil temperature is above\n41 degrees F and are continuously dry for more than 3 months following the summer solstice.  The COLE value for the solum ranges from 5.0 to 8.0 cm with most pedons being over 6.0 cm given the range of thickness of the solum.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 50 percent\ngravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry or moist and chroma\nof 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is very gravelly clay or extremely gravelly clay with 25 to 60 percent gravel and 10\nto 15 percent cobbles.  The clay percentage is 40 to 60\npercent.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline and may contain a few segregated lime coatings.\nThe 2Cd horizon (densic material) is composed mainly of strongly consolidated extremely gravelly and cobbly old alluvium; with 50 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.  The fine earth fraction ranges from clay loam to loamy sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Moist bulk density is 1.60 to 1.70 grams per cubic centimeter."
