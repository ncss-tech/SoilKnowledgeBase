  "OVERVIEW": "The Harpole series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Harpole soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 10 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 mm); and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. (6.1 C).",

These soils are moist 50 to 60 percent of the time when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is more than 41 degrees F. (5 C).  They are moist in some part for 50 to 60 consecutive days or more in the 4 months following the summer solstice.  The transitional horizon between the surface and the argillic horizon does not have to be a Bw, it can also be an AB, BA, BE or E.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value 5 dry, 4 moist, and chroma 4 to 6 dry or moist.  It is typically very gravelly sandy clay loam or very cobbly sandy clay loam.  The weighted average of this horizon is 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, and 20 to 27 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.  It is very cobbly loamy sand or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  The C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
