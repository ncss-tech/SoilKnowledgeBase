  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Heleweiser soils are on fan remnants. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,150 to 2,700 feet. The climate is low latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches, the mean annual temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 300 to 360 days."
