  "OVERVIEW": "The Higdon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on stream terraces and footslopes. These soils formed in silty colluvium and the alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches.",
