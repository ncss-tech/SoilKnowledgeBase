The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from reworked alpine glacial till deposits derived dominantly from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. Elevations are 490 to 1000 feet. Average annual precipitation is 110 to 140 inches. Fog drip contributes to the effective precipitation totals. Average annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
