(3 to 6 inches thick).\nBt--3 to 10 inches; light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky, and slightly plastic; few fine and medium, many very fine roots; common very fine tubular pores; few thin clay films lining pores and on ped faces; 10 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.5); gradual wavy boundary.

The particle-size control section contains from 10 to 30 percent gravel, and 24 to 26 percent clay. The soil is slightly acid or moderately acid throughout.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section from 5 to 15 inches is dry from about mid July to mid October (90 to 100 days).  The soil temperature at 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about mid April to late December (255 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about early April to mid December.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 6/3, or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 3/2.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, or 7.5YR 7/2.  It is loam or gravelly loam."
