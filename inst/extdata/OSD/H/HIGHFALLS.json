  "REVDATE": "05/2002",
  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Highfalls series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains, foothills, and footslopes.  They formed in glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and moderately rapid below.  Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",
