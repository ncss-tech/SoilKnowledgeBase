    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Highfalls soils are mostly on south and west-facing  mountain slopes, foothills, and footslopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  They formed in glacial till derived from granite, gneiss, and schist with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 2,800 to 5,000 feet.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The average frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

Pearsoncreek soils are on south-facing mountain and foothill slopes and have a volcanic ash mantle less than 14 inches thick.  Pend Oreille soils are on north-facing mountain and foothill slopes and are ashy over loamy.  Rubycreek soils are on mountain slopes at higher elevations and are cryic.  Treble soils are on south-facing mountain and foothill slopes, are dry more than 45 days, and contain less volcanic ash."
