This horizon is typically loam but ranges to clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or loam, averages 18 to 35 percent clay, and contains more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe C horizon ranges from loam to clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay."

Alcova and Elk Hollow soils have skeletal C horizons occurring above a depth of 40 inches.  Almy soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the B2t horizon.  Antonito soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bluerim, Cushool, Diamondville, Rawah, and Satanka soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Fluetsch soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand and have C horizons with less than 18 percent clay.  Forelle soils have a mean summer soil temperature warmer that 59 degrees F.  Rock River soils have more than 35 percent fine sandy or coarser in the argillic horizon.  Stunner and Wolford soils have calcic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in alluvial sediments derived principally from sedimentary rock.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 to 14 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 36 to 40 degrees F.; mean summer temperature is about 47 to 54 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 35 to 75 days."
