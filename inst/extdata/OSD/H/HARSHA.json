  "OVERVIEW": "The Harsha series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial sediments derived principally from sedimentary rock.  Harsha soils are on mountain side slopes, fans, and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

This horizon is typically loam but ranges to clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or loam, averages 18 to 35 percent clay, and contains more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe C horizon ranges from loam to clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay."

Antonito soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bluerim, Cushool, Diamondville, Rawah, and Satanka soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Fluetsch soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand and have C horizons with less than 18 percent clay.  Forelle soils have a mean summer soil temperature warmer that 59 degrees F.
