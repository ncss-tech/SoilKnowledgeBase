  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction is mildly alkaline or neutral throughout the soil.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is commonly calcareous in some parts and averages more than 10 percent silt plus clay.  Silt plus clay plus very fine sand totals 40 percent or more.  Most pedons contain less than 10 percent medium sand or coarser.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Noncultivated areas have A1 horizons  1 to 6 inches thick with colors similar to those stated for the Ap horizon.  The A horizon typically is fine sand or loamy fine sandy but some pedons are fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is loamy fine sand or fine sand but many pedons have thin (less than 1 cm. thick) layers or lenses of finer texture.\nCOMPETING SERIES  These are the Abscota, Carver, Chute, Dabney, Oakville, Penwood, Perks, Plainfield, Sarpy, Suncook, Tyner, Westport, and Windsor series.  Abscota soils contain less than 10 percent silt plus clay and have less fine and very fine sand.  Carver, Dabney, Oakville, Penwood, Perks, Plainfield, Suncook, Tyner, Westport, and Windsor soils lack free carbonates in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Chute soils lack stratification within the control section.  Sarpy soils have less than 10 percent silt plus clay and less than 40 percent silt plus clay plus very fine sand in their 10-to 40-inch control section."
