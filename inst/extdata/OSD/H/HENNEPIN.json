  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 10 to 20 inches in thickness.  The control section commonly averages between 20 and 27 percent clay.  The clay content ranges between 18 and 30 percent and the fine sand and coarser sand content ranges between 15 and 55 percent.  The depth to free calcium carbonates is 0 to 15 inches.\nThe upper 1/3 of the control section (A horizon) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 4.  Eroded pedons have value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  An Ap or A horizon with value of 4 or 5 may be more than 7 inches in thickness.  The A horizon typically is loam, but includes silt loam, sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, or clay loam. It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not contain free calcium carbonates.\nThe middle 1/3 of the control section (Bw horizon) has hue of 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, sandy loam, silt loam, or clay loam, or the gravelly analogs of these textures.  Some pedons do not contain coatings or clay films on the exteriors of peds.  The Bw horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not contain free calcium carbonates.\nThe lower 1/3 of the control section (C horizon) has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, sandy loam, silt loam, or clay loam, or the gravelly analogs of these textures.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Series in closely related families are Chatsworth, Hickory, Salter, and Strawn.  Chatsworth soils contain more than 30 percent clay in the lower 2/3 of the control section. Hickory and Strawn soils have argillic horizons.  Salter soils are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hennepin soils are on upland slopes that border stream valleys and on moraines.  Slope gradients range from 10 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous glacial till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation varies from 30 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Alexandria, Casco, Fox, Hickory, Hochheim, Miami, Miamian, Russell, Shoals, Strawn, and Vanmeter soils.  All of these soils are intricately mixed with Hennepin soils on the landscape in some places.   Alexandria and Miamian soils are upslope or on similar slopes nearby.  Vanmeter soils are lower on the slopes and formed in residuum weathered from calcareous shale. Casco and Fox soils contain more than 90 percent sand in the lower 1/3 and 1/4 of the control section respectively, and gravel in the lower part of the control section.  They are locally  above Hennepin soils where glacio-fluvial sediments have covered the till.  Hickory, Hochheim, Miami, Russell, and Strawn soils have argillic horizons and are upslope.   In addition, Hochheim soils have a mollic epipedon, and Russell soils are fine-silty.  Shoals soils formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains down slope from Hennepin soils."
