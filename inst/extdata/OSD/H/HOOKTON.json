The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Elevations are 3 to 430 meters (10 to 1400 feet).  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2285 millimeters (35 to 90 inches).  The frost-free period is 275 to 325 days."

Weott soils have redoximorphic feature within 10 centimeters of the soil surface. Arcata soils are on nearby dissected marine terrace sediments. Tablebluff soils are on nearly level to gently sloping dissected marine terraces. Tillas soils are on alluvial fans. Weott soils are on floodplains."

Cambic horizon - the zone from 27 to 130 centimeters. (AB, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3)\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters, averages 32 percent clay and 8 percent rock fragments.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNasis User Pedon ID: 07CA605228.\nType location was moved (8/2007) to current location to update the Typical Pedon and Range of Characteristics and to better represent the series concept. The classification was changed at that time to reflect changes in Taxonomy since the series was proposed. The Hookton soils were formally classified as fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Humic Dystrudepts\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. 10th Edition classification was fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic, Oxyaquic Dystrudepts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
