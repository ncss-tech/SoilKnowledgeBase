Bluechief soils have a lithic contact between depths of 20 and 40 inches. Boreham, Moffat, Nakai, Nakoy, and Nolava soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  McCutchen soils are high in pyroclastic materials. Boreham and McCutchen soils have a lithological discontinuity below a depth of 40 inches.  Kinan, Moffat, Nakai and Pagina soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout the profile.  Nuahs soils have a calcic horizon within 12 inches of the surface.  Pagina soils have a paralithic contact between depths of 20 and 40 inches. Trook soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hiko Springs soils are on lake terraces, dissected lake plains, alluvial plains, outwash plains and fan remnants at elevations of 3,500 to 6,100 feet.  They formed in alluvium and residuum from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The climate is arid.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 57 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 69 to 74 degrees F, and the freeze-free period is 100 to 170 days."
