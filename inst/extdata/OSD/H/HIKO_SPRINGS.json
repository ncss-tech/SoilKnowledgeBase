  "OVERVIEW": "The Hiko Springs series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous and sedimentary rocks on dissected lake plains, alluvial plains, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Boreham and McCutchen soils have a lithological discontinuity below a depth of 40 inches.  Kinan, Moffat, Nakai and Pagina soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout the profile.  Nuahs soils have a calcic horizon within 12 inches of the surface.  Pagina soils have a paralithic contact between depths of 20 and 40 inches.
