  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 65 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to fragipan is 18 to 32 inches.  Depth to redox depletions or iron concentrations is from 16 to 30 inches.  Content of clay in the control section is 18 to 30 percent.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent in the solum, and 10 to 50 percent in the fragipan. Content of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent.  Rock fragments are shale, siltstone, or sandstone channers about 0.5 to 3 inches in diameter and 0.25 inches thick.  In unlimed areas, soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper solum and from slightly acid to strongly acid in the lower part of the solum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is moderate or strong, medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is firm.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Comly, Jonca, and Readington, series in the same family. Comly, and Jonca, soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the B- horizon. Jonca soils formed in loess over residuum from sandstone.  Readington soils were formed in residuum and are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hustontown soils are on colluvial fans and U-shaped drainageways and headslopes in the Ridge and Valley Province.  The soils are on concave foot slopes and toe slopes.  The soils are formed in colluvium derived from acid red shale, siltstone and sandstone sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 50 to 53 degrees.  The number of frost-free days range from 120 to 196."
