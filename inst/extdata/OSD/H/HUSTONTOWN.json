  "OVERVIEW": "The Hustontown series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on dissected uplands.  They are formed in colluvium derived from acid red shale, siltstone and sandstone sedimentary rocks.  Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and moderately slow in the fragipan.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 51 degrees.",
