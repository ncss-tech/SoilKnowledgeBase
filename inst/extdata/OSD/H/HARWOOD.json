  "OVERVIEW": "The Harwood series consists of moderately deep, well drained soil that formed in loess and old alluvium. Harwood soils are on uplands and dissected terraces. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The control section contains 18 to 25 percent clay, more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser, and less than 15 percent rock fragments by weighted average.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist or dry. It is loam, silt loam, or very stony silt loam, and has weak or moderate structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is loam or silt loam and has moderate blocky or prismatic structure.\nThe Bq horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. It is gravelly loam, silt loam, or gravelly silt loam, and is massive or has weak blocky structure."
