  "OVERVIEW": "The Harwood series consists of moderately deep, well drained soil that formed in loess and old alluvium. Harwood soils are on uplands and dissected terraces. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
