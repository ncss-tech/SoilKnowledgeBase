These soils are dry between depths of 8 and 12 inches more than 1/2 the time when the soil temperature is above 40 degrees F. The mollic epipedon  ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick. The control section contains 18 to 25 percent clay, more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser, and less than 15 percent rock fragments by weighted average.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist or dry. It is loam, silt loam, or very stony silt loam, and has weak or moderate structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is loam or silt loam and has moderate blocky or prismatic structure.\nThe Bq horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.
