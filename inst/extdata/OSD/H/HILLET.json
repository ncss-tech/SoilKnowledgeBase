  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to the IIB or IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches in thickness. Depth to free carbonates is 8 feet or more. The A and B horizons lack coarse fragments and the IIB and IIC horizons contain as much as 50 percent by volume of gravel of mixed lithology. The gravel is mostly of igneous rocks and commonly less than 1.0 cm.\ni. diameter. Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 42 to 47 degrees F. Mineralogy of the fine earth fraction is mixed. The upper materials below depths of 10 inches average between 12 and 18 percent clay and less acid through neutral. Some pedons have an 0 horizons as much as 6 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value or 2 or 3 and chroma of 1. It is black (N 2/0) or very dark gray loam. It has a weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky, or platy structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR., 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. Mottles are mostly distinct or prominent and range from few to many. The B1 and B2 horizons are silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam. The B3 horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sand loam, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. The B horizon has weak platy or subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sand or coarse sand and contains as much as 50 percent gravel."

Slope gradients are 1 percent or less. Hillet soils formed in a 20 to 40 inch silt layer over leached reddish or brownish sand and gravel of Late Wisconsin Age. The climate is humid continental with warm summers and cold winters. Mean annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 24 to 30 inches."
