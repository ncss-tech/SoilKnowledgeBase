    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Honker soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  These soils typically occur on southern exposures. Elevations range from 500 to 3,300 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from sedimentary rock of the Franciscan Formation.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 to 22 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; mean July temperature is 75 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 59 to 62 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 190 to 260 days."

Fifield soils are loamy-skeletal and have a mollic epipedon.  Franciscan soils are fine-loamy and have a mollic epipedon. Millsholm and Quinto soils less than 20 inches deep.  Quiensabe soils have a mollic epipedon and lack an abrupt A/Bt2 boundary.  Sehorn soils lack an argillic horizon and develop deep, wide cracks when dry."

They are being differentiated from the Vallecitos series by being moderately deep.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 14 inches (A1,A2,A3)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 28 inches (Bt1,Bt2)\nCEC/Clay ratio estimated from similar soils with laboratory data in the W. Stanislaus Soil Survey Area.\nRapid runoff adjusted 9/96 to very high, new terminology of the Soil Survey Manual, 10/93.\nLast review and transmission of file 5/98.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
