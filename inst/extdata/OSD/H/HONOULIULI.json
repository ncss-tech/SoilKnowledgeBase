Coral fragments are mixed in the upper part of the solum by cultivation where these soils are adjacent to the Mamala soils.  Avergae annual soil temperature is about 74 degrees F..   The soil is dry in some horizon for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.  The A horizon has value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  The B horizon has moist chroma of 2 or 3."
