  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to\nslightly acid in the A horizon and is very strongly acid or\nstrongly acid in the lower horizons.  Base saturation at 72 inches ranges from 20 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon is fine sand or loamy fine sand and is 40 to 64\ninches thick.  The A11 horizon has hue of 10YR with colors of very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  When value\nis less than 3.5 the horizon is less than 10 inches thick.  The\nA12 horizon has hue of 10YR with colors of grayish brown (10YR\n5/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y with colors of gray (10YR 6/1), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2;\n2.5Y 7/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), or very pale brown (10YR 7/3).  Most pedons contain mottles in shades of brown and yellow.  Some\npart of the A or A2 horizon has colors with chroma of 3.  The A2 material of the A and B horizon is gray (10YR 6/1), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2).  It is mostly\nloamy fine sand, but ranges from fine sand to fine sandy loam.  In the upper part of the horizon, the skeletans of A2 material makes\nup 50 to 70 percent and in the lower part it makes up 30 to 50 percent.  The B2t material is yellowish brown (10YR 5/6, 5/8), brownish yellow (10YR 6/6, 6/8), yellow (10YR 7/6, 7/8), strong\nbrown (7.5YR 6/5, 5/8), yellowish red (5YR 5/8), gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), or light gray (10YR 7/1).  The horizon is typically mottled\nin these colors.  The B2t material is in vertically oriented\nbodies with a texture of sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or fine\nsandy loam.\nThe C horizon is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  It is light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2; N 7/0).  Some pedons contain yellowish or brownish mottles."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Plummer series in the same family and the Chipley, Kanapaha, Leagueville, Leefield, Mustang, Osier, Pelham, and Rentzel series.  Chipley, Mustang, and Osier soils\nhave sandy control sections and lack argillic horizons.  Leefield\nand Rentzel soils contain more than 5 percent plinthite in the Bt horizon and are better drained.  Leagueville and Pelham soils have\na sandy epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick.  Plummer soils are gray throughout and lack a seasonal dry period during late summer and fall.  Kanapaha soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater\nthan 72 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Henco soils are on bottoms of narrow drainageways and on short sideslopes along the drainageway.  They formed in sandy and loamy sediments in the Southern Coastal Plain.  Slopes are mainly 2 to 3 percent but range from 1 to 5 percent.\nMean annual rainfall ranges from 37 to 48 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 degrees to 68 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 64."

Leagueville soils are in similar positions.  Lufkin and Raino soils are on broad mounded\nareas and lack sandy epipedons.  Nahatche and Thenas are loamy\nsoils on flood plains.  Pickton, Wolfpen, and Tonkawa soils are on high ridgetops and sloping to strongly sloping sideslopes.\nTonkawa soils lack argillic horizons.  Pickton and Wolfpen soils\nhave base saturation of more than 35 percent and are well drained.  Wolfpen soils have a sandy epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick."
