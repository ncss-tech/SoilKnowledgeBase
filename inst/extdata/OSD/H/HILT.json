    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact of weathered sedimentary rock.  Hard bedrock is at depths below 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature commonly is 53 to 56 degrees F. but ranges from 53 to 59 degrees F.  The mean January soil temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F.; the mean July soil temperature is 70 to 83 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from March 1 to December 20 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from April 1 to November 25.  The soil between depths of 8 and 18 inches, is dry from mid-July until mid-October in most years and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The organic carbon is less than 0.6 percent when mixed to 7 inches or in some part to a depth of 10 inches.  The soil is medium acid to neutral and the base saturation ranges from 80 to 95 percent.\nThe A1 horizon is brown, dark yellowish brown, yellowish brown or reddish brown (10YR 4l3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4).  Moist colors are very dark grayish brown, dark brown, dark yellowish brown or dark reddish brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4; 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4).  It is loam or sandy loam with 10 to 30 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent and consist mostly of stones and cobbles.\nThe B2t horizon is reddish brown, yellowish red, brown, strong brown or yellowish brown (5YR 4/4, 4/6, 4/8, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 5/4, 5/6).  Moist colors are reddish brown, dark reddish gray, reddish brown, dark brown, dark yellowish brown, dark grayish brown, brown or dark yellowish brown (5YR 3/4, 4/2 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/4; 10YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4).  It is heavy loam or sandy clay loam averaging between 20 and 35 percent clay and more than 45 percent total sand.  There is at least 4 percent increase in clay from the A horizon to the B1t horizon or B2t horizon.  The percent clay increase ranges from 4 to 10 percent and occurs within a distance of 12 inches.\nThe Cr horizon has the same color, texture and reaction ranges as the B2t horizon but retains about 50 percent of the original rock structure."

Bancas soils have soil temperatures above 47 degrees F. by mid-February and are dry about 180 days.  Blakeport soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F. and are medium acid or strongly acid.  Bull Trail and Steinbeck soils lack a paralithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Also, Bull Trail soils have soil temperatures above 47 degrees F. by mid-February and Steinbeck soils have a thick A2 horizon.  Duzel soils have a mollic epipedon.  Facey soils have a mollic epipedon and lack a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have less than 45 percent total sand tn the control section.  Morical soils have 20 to 40 percent ash and pumice and are neutral or mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hilt soils are on hills and uplands with a dissected terrace-like appearance.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from sedimentary rocks of the Hornbrook Formation that include sandstone and quartzitic conglomerate.  Elevations are 2,000 to 3,500 feet.  The underlying sedimentary rock is sandstone or sandstone conglomerate that contains well rounded quartzite fragments that are of coarse pebble or cobblestone size.  The rock is normally moderately weathered in the upper 10 to 16 inches and gradually becomes hard.  The Hilt soils are in a transition zone from grassland to mixed coniferous forest.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm to hot dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 8 to 36 inches.  Mean January temperature is 33 to 37 degrees F., mean July temperature is 67 to 70 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."
