  "OVERVIEW": "The Hope series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and alluvium derived from Mancos Shale.  Hope soils are in alluvial flats.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

Gypsum content was determined using a HACH kit.  EC was determined using a portable conductivity meter from a saturated extract.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
