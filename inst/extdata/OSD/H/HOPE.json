(Bky1, Bky2, Bky3, Bky4 horizons)\nCalcic Horizon:  The zone from 10 to 19 inches.  (Bky1)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a field calcimeter.  Gypsum content was determined using a HACH kit.  EC was determined using a portable conductivity meter from a saturated extract.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
