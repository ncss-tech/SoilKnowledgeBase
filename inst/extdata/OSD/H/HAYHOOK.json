Agustin, Lostman, Pajarito and Sahuarita soils are calcareous above 20 inches. Filaree, Lostman, and Nasagold soils are in the Mohave Desert; Pyxo soils are in the Central California Coast Range.  These soils are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September.  In addition, Pajarito contains less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Sahuarita soils have buried argillic horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches.
