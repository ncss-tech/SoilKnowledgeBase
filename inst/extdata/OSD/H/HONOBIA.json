Reaction ranges from slightly to strongly acid in the A horizons and from medium to very strongly acid in the B2t horizons.  Stony and gravelly phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, values ranging from 3 to 5, and chromas from 1 to 3.  The fine-earth fraction of the soil is fine sandy loam or loam.  Flat fragments of sandstone or shale from 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter make up 20 to 40 percent by volume and from 3 inches to 24 inches in diameter make up 0 to 20 percent by volume.\nThe E horizon has hue 10YR, values 5 or 6 and chromas from 3 or 4.  The fine-earth fraction of the soil is loam or fine sandy loam.  Flat fragments of sandstone or shale from 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter make up 20 to 40 percent by volume and from 3 inches to 24 inches diameter make up 0 to 20 percent by volume.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR, and 10YR, values ranging from 4 or 5 and chromas from 4 to 6.  The fine-earth fraction of the soil is loam or fine sandy loam.  Flat fragments of sandstone or shale from 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter make up 20 to 40 percent by volume and from 3 inches to 24 inches diameter make up 0 to 20 percent by volume.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hues of 5YR, 7.5YR, and 10YR; values of 4 or 5, and chromas ranging from 4 to 8.  The fine-earth fraction of the soil is clay loam or clay with clay content of 35 to 45 percent.  Flat fragments of sandstone and shale from 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter make up 35 to 50 percent by volume.\nThe Bt2 and Bt3 horizons have hues of 2.5YR to 10YR, values ranging from 4 to 6, and chromas from 4 to 8.  These horizons have iron accumulations in shades of red and brown.  The fine-earth fraction of the soil is clay.  Flat fragments of sandstone and shale from 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter make up 35 to 70 percent by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is olive or gray fractured shale that is tilted 20 degrees to 90 degrees from horizontal."
