  "OVERVIEW": "The Honobia series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on strongly sloping to moderately steep forested uplands of the Ouachita Mountains.  Water runs off the surface moderately to rapidly.  Slopes range from 8 to 20 percent.",

Reaction ranges from slightly to strongly acid in the A horizons and from medium to very strongly acid in the B2t horizons.  Stony and gravelly phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, values ranging from 3 to 5, and chromas from 1 to 3.  The fine-earth fraction of the soil is fine sandy loam or loam.  Flat fragments of sandstone or shale from 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter make up 20 to 40 percent by volume and from 3 inches to 24 inches in diameter make up 0 to 20 percent by volume.\nThe E horizon has hue 10YR, values 5 or 6 and chromas from 3 or 4.  The fine-earth fraction of the soil is loam or fine sandy loam.  Flat fragments of sandstone or shale from 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter make up 20 to 40 percent by volume and from 3 inches to 24 inches diameter make up 0 to 20 percent by volume.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR, and 10YR, values ranging from 4 or 5 and chromas from 4 to 6.
