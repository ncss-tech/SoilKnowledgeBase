  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Helkitchen soils are on backslopes of mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,600 to 3,600 feet. The climate is typical of a low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 9 inches, the mean annual temperature is 66 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."
