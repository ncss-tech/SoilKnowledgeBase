  "OVERVIEW": "The Helkitchen series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone. Helkitchen soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F.",

Elevations are 1,600 to 3,600 feet. The climate is typical of a low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 9 inches, the mean annual temperature is 66 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."
