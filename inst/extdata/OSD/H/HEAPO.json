  "OVERVIEW": "The Heapo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary and quartzite rocks.  Heapo soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
