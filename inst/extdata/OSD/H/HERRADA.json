Altega soils are also fine-silty and occur on the summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus. Altezita soils are shallow to sandstone, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on the summits of plateaus.  Esquila soils are shallow to sandstone, are in the fine family, and occur on toeslopes of plateaus.  Estrada soils are very deep, have mollic epipedons, and occur on valley sides.  Uva soils are shallow to sandstone and occur on adjacent summits and shoulders"
