The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

The revision of September 2002 updated the official series concept to reflect the presence of a calcic horizon as supported by laboratory data of the typical pedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as user pedon ID 84NV007119 (pedon # 84P0619).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
