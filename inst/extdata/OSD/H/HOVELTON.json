Ackna, Brysill, Bunselmeier, Cubhill, McDaniel and Millhouse soils are very deep. Blint soils are dry for 90 to 100 consecutive days and have a mollic epipedon 20 to 25 inches thick. Hehe soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Lainand soils are deep to a lithic contact. Leidl soils have base saturation less than 75 percent in some part of the solum and average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Nint soils have a mollic epipedon 20 to 35 inches thick. Norod soils are dry for 100 to 120 consecutive days and have secondary carbonates at 25 to 38 inches. Skooker soils are deep to a paralithic contact."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt and welded tuff mixed with volcanic ash. Slopes range from 25 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 22 inches. The average annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 150 days."
