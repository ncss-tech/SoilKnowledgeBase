  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to layers with n value greater than 0.7 ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The reaction of the Ap and Bg horizons ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.  The Cg horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is clay, mucky clay, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a thin Oa horizon on the surface with texture of muck.  Other pedons have an Oab horizon, 2 to 7 inches thick, immediately below the Ap horizon.  The Oa and Oab horizons have the same range in color as the Ap horizon.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, or 5BG; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown.  It is clay with or without thin layers or lenses of silty clay.\nThe Ab horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is clay, silty clay  or mucky clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, 2.5Y, 5BG, 5GY, or 5G; value of 2 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is clay, silty clay, or mucky clay.  In some pedons, the Cg horizon is silty clay loam below a depth of 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harahan soils are in artificially drained backswamp positions on the flood plain of the lower Mississippi River and its distributaries.  They formed from fluid, alluvial clays that were artificially altered by man to become firm and form a solum in the upper 20 to 40 inches.  Elevations are about sea level to 1 or 2 feet below sea level.  Slope is less than 0.5 percent.  Near the type location the average annual rainfall is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F."

Barbary soils are in undrained backswamps and have n-value more than 0.7 throughout.  Gentilly and Scatlake soils are in undrained freshwater to saline marshes, have a histic epipedon, and have n-value more than 0.7 throughout the upper 20 to or more inches.  Schriever and Thibaut soils have thicker sola and have n-value less than 0.7 in all layers to 60 or more inches deep."

Harahan soils are protected from flooding and the water table is controled by a system of levees and pumps."
