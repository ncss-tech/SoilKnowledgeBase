  "OVERVIEW": "The Hardesty series consists of very deep, moderatley well drained soils that formed in alluvium having more than 60 percent volcanic ash mixed with loess in the upper part. Hardesty soils are on low terraces, in broad basins, in depressions, and on alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
