  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hardesty soils are on low terraces along intermittent drainageways, in depressions, in broad basins and on alluvial fans at elevations of 1,500 to 3,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium having more than 60 percent volcanic ash mixed with loess in the upper part. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 130 days."

Donavan soils are coarse-loamy and are on toeslopes, footslopes, and backslopes of foothills and mountains. Lenz soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to hard granite and are on foothills. Opportunity soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep and are on outwash terraces. Spokane soils are coarse loamy, moderately deep to weathered granite and are on foothills and mountains."
