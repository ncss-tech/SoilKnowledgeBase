The mollic epipedon is 7 to 19 inches thick and extends into the B horizon of most pedons.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is cemented sandstone.  Very few roots penetrate the Cr horizon.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

All the above soils except the Anselmo and Ronson soils have slightly drier climate.  Anselmo and Manter soils do not have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.  Mawer soils are underlain by sand and gravel at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Ronson soils do not have an argillic horizon and contain free carbonates within a depth of 10 inches.  Rosebud soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Holt soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands having convex surfaces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent, but usually are less than 10 percent.  They formed in loamy residuum weathered from moderately soft calcareous sandstone.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F, and the annual precipitation is 15 to 22 inches."

Tassel soils have bedrock at depths less than 20 inches and are on steeper landscapes.  Vetal soils are in swales and do not have an argillic horizon.  In addition, Vetal soils have a mollic epipedon that is more than 20 inches thick."
