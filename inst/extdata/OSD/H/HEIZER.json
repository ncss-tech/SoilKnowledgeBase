The soil contains free carbonates throughout and is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is gravelly loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very channery loam or very gravelly loam.  Coarse limestone or chalk fragments 1/2 to 6 inches along the longer axis, range from 35 to 60 percent by volume."

Brownell soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Kipson and Nibson soils contain less than 35 percent by volume of coarse fragments and, in addition, have a paralithic contact at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Sogn soils contain less than 35 percent by volume of coarse fragments."

The soils formed in residuum weathered from chalky limestone.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 25 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 34 to 42."

All these soils, except Brownell, contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments by volume.  In addition, Armo, Harney, and Mento soils lack bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Armo soils are on side slopes or foot slopes below Heizer soils.  Brownell soils occupy less sloping or similar positions as Heizer soils. Harney, Mento, and Wakeen soils are on less sloping upland divides."
