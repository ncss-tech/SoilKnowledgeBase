  "OVERVIEW": "The Heizer series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum from chalky limestone.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 5 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 23 inches.",

The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 12 inches.  The soil contains free carbonates throughout and is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is gravelly loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very channery loam or very gravelly loam.  Coarse limestone or chalk fragments 1/2 to 6 inches along the longer axis, range from 35 to 60 percent by volume."

Brownell soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Kipson and Nibson soils contain less than 35 percent by volume of coarse fragments and, in addition, have a paralithic contact at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Sogn soils contain less than 35 percent by volume of coarse fragments."

All these soils, except Brownell, contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments by volume.  In addition, Armo, Harney, and Mento soils lack bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Armo soils are on side slopes or foot slopes below Heizer soils.  Brownell soils occupy less sloping or similar positions as Heizer soils. Harney, Mento, and Wakeen soils are on less sloping upland divides."
