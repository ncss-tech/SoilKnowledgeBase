Crow and Ligocki soils are very deep. Crow soils have an ustic moisture regime that borders on udic. Echolake, Lubrecht, Rittel and Valnor soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Dargol, Rittel, and Valnor soils all have hues of 2.5Y. Fortlewis soils have combination B/E horizons. The Zuni soils formed from granitic material."

Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. Elevations range from 7,800 to 8,200 feet. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. The frost free period is 90 to 110 days."
