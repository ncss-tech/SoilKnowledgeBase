  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Heckly series consists of moderately deep to interbedded sandstone and siltstone, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone. Heckly soils are on sideslopes of hills and ridges. Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
