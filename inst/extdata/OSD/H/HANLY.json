It is stratified and contains one or more very thin layers of loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Surface horizons having value as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist do not exceed 6 inches in thickness.  This horizon is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons contain thin coarse sand layers below a depth of 30 inches.  A few pedons contain thin Ab horizons below a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hanly soils are on flood plains and low terraces of larger streams.  Slopes mainly are less than 2 percent, but some are as steep as 6 percent along narrow edges of terraces.  The soils formed in stratified sandy recent alluvium.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

They have mollic epipedons.  Glendive and Havre soils are on the same flood plain, but are further from the stream.  Glendive soils are coarse-loamy.  Havre soils are fine-loamy.  Wolf Point soils are on adjacent low flood plains.  The are fine.  Zeona soils are on adjacent wind modified terraces and uplands.  They do not have stratification and do not have carbonates in the control section."
