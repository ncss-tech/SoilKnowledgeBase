  "OVERVIEW": "The Hartner series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and residuum and colluvium from andesite, andesitic tuff or tuff-breccia. Hartner soils are on backslopes of mountains. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Lithology of fragments is volcanic rocks such as andesitic tuff, andesite and tuff-breccia.\nA horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5 YR\nValue: 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 2 percent.\nC horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist; darker colors are a result of lithochromic influence, not organic matter.\nStructure: Massive or subangular blocky.\nRock fragments: 15 to 35 percent, mainly pebbles; pebbles less than 20mm in size are up to half the total volume. Paragravel and paracobbles that break down to fine pebbles are common, ranging up to 50 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 0.5 to 0.75 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hartner soils are on backslopes of mountains. They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic ash and andesite, andesitic tuff, tuff-breccia and similar volcanic rocks. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 4,690 to 7,160 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches but effective moisture is low due to the very shallow, droughty soil and steep slopes. Mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."

The classification is changed from Argixerolls to Torriorthents, which better represents the thin, unstable soils of the area.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 4 inches (A and C horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 4 inches to underlying soft bedrock (Cr layer).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - High volcanic glass content in the .02 to 2mm fraction from the mineral soil surface to 25 inches (A and C horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from about 0 to 4 inches (A and C horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
