The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from the pedon at site 2 (in Gile, L.H. 1987. Late Holocene displacement along the Organ Mountains fault in southern New Mexico.  New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources Circular 196) support the classification.  Data from five additional sites in the same report also illustrate Holliday soils.\nUpdated competing series section 3/13/08, CEM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
