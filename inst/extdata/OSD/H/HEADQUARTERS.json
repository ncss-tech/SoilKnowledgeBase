The soils formed in a wide variety of parent materials of late and mid-Pleistocene age.  Stream deposited parent materials of the basin floor are of mixed origin and consist largely of noneffervescent sand with a few fine gravel.  Parent materials commonly are derived from a mixture of calcareous sedimentary rocks and igneous rocks--limestone, andesite, rhyolite, monzonite, granite, and sandstone.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 58 to 66 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches with a marked summer maximum."
