  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Headquarters soils are on alluvial-fan piedmonts with slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent, and in level or nearly level basin floor positions.  The soils formed in a wide variety of parent materials of late and mid-Pleistocene age.  Stream deposited parent materials of the basin floor are of mixed origin and consist largely of noneffervescent sand with a few fine gravel.  Parent materials commonly are derived from a mixture of calcareous sedimentary rocks and igneous rocks--limestone, andesite, rhyolite, monzonite, granite, and sandstone.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 58 to 66 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches with a marked summer maximum."

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typifying pedon is similar to, and only a few feet away from, pedon S60 N Mex 7-18 (L.H.
