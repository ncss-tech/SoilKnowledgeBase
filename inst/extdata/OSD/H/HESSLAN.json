The soil are usually moist, but are dry each year for 60 to 80 consecutive days between depths of 8 and 24 inches within the 4 month period following the summer solstice. Thickness of the solum and depth to paralithic contact range from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 to 20 percent in the A horizons and 5 to 30 percent in the B horizons. Surface stones range from 5 to 20 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is stony loam or cobbly loam.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam or cobbly loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. This horizon has weak or moderate medium or fine subangular blocky structure."

Anders soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Bong, Chenoweth, Cleverly, Conconully, Juliaetta, Knutsen, Laidlaw, Newbon, Owhi, Phoebe, Uhlig and Wato soils lack a paralithic or lithic contact above depth of 40 inches. Also, Bong, Jnutsen, Laidlaw and Phoebe soils are moderately coarse textured.  Durart soils dominantly are silt loam, have less than 5 percent rock fragments and are dry for 80 to 90 days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hesslan soils are on south-facing slopes at elevations of 500 to 3,500 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium weathered from sedimentary bedrock mixed with loess and volcanic ash. The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 14 to 20 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 49 degrees F.; the mean winter temperature is about 37 degrees F.; and the mean summer temperature is about 60 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."

Chenoweth and Cherryhill soils have less steep slopes, are fine, loamy, and are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Frailey soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock. Skyline soils are less than 20 inches deep to semiconsolidated sandstone. Wamic soils commonly have less steep slopes, lack mollic epipedons and rock fragments, and have very hard or extremely hard 2C horizons at depths of 24 to 36 inches."
