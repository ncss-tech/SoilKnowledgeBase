Devaul and Horrocks soils have bedrock within 152 cm. Glideski soils lacks a Mollic epipedon that includes part of the argillic horizon. Holmes soils are dry for about 60 days and have C horizons within a depth of 40 to 80 cm that has textures of very gravelly and cobbly sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or coarse sandy loam. Howcan soils have soil temperature of 3 to 7 degrees C. and the mollic epipedon does not include the upper part of the argillic horizons. Longday soils have the base of the argillic greater than 114 cm. Pequop soils are more than 100 cm deep to the base of the argillic horizons.  Wambolt soils contain 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the control section."
