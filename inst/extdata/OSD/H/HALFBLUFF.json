  "OVERVIEW": "The Halfbluff series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in marine deposits from mixed sources.  Halfbluff soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
