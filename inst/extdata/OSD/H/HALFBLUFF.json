The soils have an udic soil moisture regime and an oxyaquic regime subclass. A seasonal water table is present for 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days in most years within the zone from 75 to 100 centimeters (30 to 40 inches).\nSoil temperature: Soil temperature: The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters (20 inches) is 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F).

Elevations are 4 to 183 meters (10 to 600 feet).  The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F).  The mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2285 millimeters (35 to 90 inches).  The frost-free period is 275 to 325 days."
