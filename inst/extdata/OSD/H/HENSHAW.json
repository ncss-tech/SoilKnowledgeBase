  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the A and Bt horizons and ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Btg, BCg, and Cg horizons.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 10 feet.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 , and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.    Commonly this horizon is an evenly mottled pattern with no dominant matrix color in the lower part.  Redoximorphic features range from few to common and are in shades of gray and brown.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral.  Redoximorphic features range from few to common and are in shades of brown or yellow.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC or BCg horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many and are in shades of brown, yellow or gray.  Some pedons havea few fine calcium carbonate concretions.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many and are in shades of brown or yellow.  Most pedons have few to common calcium carbonate concretions ranging from 2mm to 5cm in diameter.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam, but some pedons have stratified layers of loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam. ."

Appleriver soils have a paralithic contact within 60 inches. Blair, Bunkum, Fishhook, Freeburg, Geff, Glenford, and Muren soils do not have carbonates at depths less than 60 inches.  Xenia soils are moderately well drained.  Torox soils have 2 to 15 percent fragments and coarser textures in the lower series control section.  Reesville soils have greater than 20 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."

Henshaw soils formed in alluvium derived from calcareous loess. Near the type location the average annual air temperature is 56.9 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 46.3 inches."

McGary and Markland soils have argillic horizons with more than 40 percent clay and are on slightly higher stream terraces.  Patton soils have dark colored A horizons and lack argillic horizons and are in depressions.  Uniontown soils lack iron depletions in the upper part of the argillic horizon and are on similar landscapes.  Wakeland soils lack argillic horizons."
