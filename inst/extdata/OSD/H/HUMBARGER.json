  "OVERVIEW": "The Humbarger series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains in Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is 660 millimeters (26 inches) in the type location.",
