Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Chupe soils are sandy, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on flood plains of valley floors.  Golondrina soils are loamy-skeletal, have thin mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on backslopes and footslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Paraje soils are loamy-skeletal, have argillic and calcic horizons, and occur on shoulders of erosional fan remnants.  Vitrina soils are coarse-loamy, have thin mollic epipedons and argillic horizons, and occur on adjacent toeslopes of erosional fan remnants."
