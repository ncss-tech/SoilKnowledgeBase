  "OVERVIEW": "The Highland series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from volcanic sources. Highland soils are on backslopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
