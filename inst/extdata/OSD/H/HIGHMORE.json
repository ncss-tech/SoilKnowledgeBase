  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 9 to 20 inches in thickness and extends into the Bt horizon in most pedons. The solum has up to 5 percent by volume granitic pebbles in some pedons.  Scattered boulders are on the surface or embedded in the soil of some pedons.  The depth to carbonate typically is about 17 inches but ranges from 12 to 26 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It averages between 27 and 35 percent clay and between 3 and 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have Btk horizons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Accumulations of carbonate range from few to many, fine to coarse and extend into the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Mottles are in most pedons in the lower part and vary considerably in amount, size, and contrast.  Thin layers of stratified sediments are common in the lower C horizon in some pedons.\n2C horizons are at depths of 40 to more than 60 inches in some pedons and consist of loam or clay loam glacial till."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Agar, Eakin, Fairlo, Holdrege, Monticello, Northdale, and Paka series.  Agar soils formed in loess and have less sand that is coarser than very fine than the Highmore soils.  Eakin soils have glacial till between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Fairlo soils are underlain by clayey sediments.  Holdrege soils have thicker A horizons and are leached of carbonates to greater depths.  Monticello and Northdale soils have redder hue.  Paka soils formed mainly in residuum weathered from siltstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Highmore soils formed in silty glacial drift.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 17 to 21 inches."

Eakin, Glenham, and Raber soils are intermingled with Highmore soils on the more undulating landscapes.  Glenham soils are fine-loamy and Raber soils are fine.  DeGrey and Walke soils have a natric horizon and are on flats that are slightly lower than the Highmore soils. Mobridge and Onita soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick and are on footslopes."
