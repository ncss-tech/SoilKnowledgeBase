The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The solum is 40 inches or more thick.  Depth to basalt bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The control section has more than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is ashy silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel, 20 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate, and more than 0.4 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.  The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel. Krotovinas 2 to 8 inches in diameter are common in most profiles.  The soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or loam with 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  The soil reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Secondary lime occurs in some pedons.  It has 0 to 5 percent CaCO3 equivalent."

Harlow soils are clayey-skeletal, shallow, and are on adjacent south slopes.  Parsnip soils are 10 to 20 inches to bedrock, have a mollic epipedon 7 to 15 inches thick, and are on adjacent plateaus.  Snell soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock, clayey-skeletal, and are on north-facing side slopes.   Wallowa soils are fine-loamy, lack argillic horizons, and are the moderately deep component of patterned ground.  Zumwalt soils have a fine textured control section and are on adjacent hill slopes."
