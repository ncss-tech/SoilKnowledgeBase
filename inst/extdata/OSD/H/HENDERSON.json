The content of coarse fragments range from 15 to 50 percent in the A horizon, and from 15 to 30 percent in the Bt horizons.  Stones cover 0 to 3 percent of the surface.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is cherty sandy loam or cherty loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 and chroma of 3, 4, or 6.  Texture is cherty sandy loam or cherty loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.  Redox accumulations in shades of red, brown and yellow range from few to many.  Some horizons in the lower part of the profile have no dominant color and are mixed in these colors. ; below a depth of 40 inches, gray.  The mean average clay content in the upper 20 inches is 40 to 60 percent with more than 20 percent sand."

Carnegie, Esto, Marlboro, and Faceville soils do not contain significant amounts of chert fragments and all have Kandic horizons except Marlboro.  Greenville and Red Bay soils are Rhodic.  In addition, Red bay soils are fine-loamy.  Lakeland soils are sandy throughout and lack Bt horizons.  Nankin soils have more than 20 percent decrease in clay from the maximum within 60 inches of the surface.  Tifton soils are fine-loamy and have more than 5 percent plinthite, by volume."
