  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in aeolian deposits and glacial outwash.  Hale soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Annual precipitation is 40 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:   Characterization data are available on these soils.  Laboratory number 81P3077-3083.  This draft reflects a change in classification from coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Aquic Xerochrepts to coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed mesic Aquic Haplorthods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 10 inches, a spodic horizon from 10 to 26 inches and an abrupt textural change at 26 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon, but does meet micro morphological criteria, i.e. silt-sized pellets and cracked coatings.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
