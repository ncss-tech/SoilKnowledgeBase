  "OVERVIEW": "The Holguin series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils over very slowly permeable conglomerate bedrock.  These gently undulating to undulating soils formed in residuum weathered from conglomerate members of the Duff and Pruett Formations and are on hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
