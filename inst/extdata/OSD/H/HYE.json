  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hye series consists of moderately deep to sandstone bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum from red colored Cambrian age sandstone bedrock. These soils are on gently sloping to moderately sloping footslopes of ridges. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in).",
