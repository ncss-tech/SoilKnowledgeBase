    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 5/2003--This revision updates redoximorphic features to current standards and revises competing series and geographically associated soils sections. The content of glauconite in the C horizon was also broadened from 2 to 10 percent to 2 to 15 percent to facilitate the correlation of Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Additionally, colors, geographic setting, parent materials and other features as well as ranges in characteristics were also revised. This OSD was also converted to tabular format. This series has historically been used as a dual drainage class soil and has been maintained with this revision to facilitate ongoing correlations.\nSome pedons have been observed to have thin, weakly iron-cemented lenses in the C horizon of this soil.  These lenses have not been described to be significant enough for a petroferric contact or zone of induration.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 12 to 38 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nAquic conditions (Aquic subgroup)--iron depletions and concentrations at 20 inches (within upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon)\nLow glauconite pellet content feature---glauconite pellet content averages between 2 and 10 percent by volume within the mineralogy control section (upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nOSD Data Map Unit ID: 000000 (to be developed)\nOSD User Pedon ID: 00XX000000 (to be developed)\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5 Soil Name Slope Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip Elevation\nNJ0022 HOLMDEL  0- 5  50- 58  180-215   42- 48  5-170\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNJ0022 NONE          1.0-3.5  APPARENT DEC-APR    >72\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNJ0022  0-12  L FSL                   0-  0  95-100 10-15   6- 12\nNJ0022  0-12  LS LFS SL               0-  0  95-100  5-10   5- 10\nNJ0022 12-38  SL SCL L                0-  0  95-100 15-30   6- 12\nNJ0022 38-60  SR SL S                 0-  0  90-100  2-15   2-  6\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
