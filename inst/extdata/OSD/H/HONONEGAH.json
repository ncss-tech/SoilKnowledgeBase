Some subhorizons contain more than 35 percent by volume of rock fragments.\nAp or A horizon:\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 to 3\nTexture: loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or sandy loam\nReaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline\nBw horizon:\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 3 or 4\nChroma: 2 to 4\nTexture: commonly coarse sand or loamy coarse sand but individual horizons include loam, sandy loam, sand, and loamy sand, and the gravelly analogues of these textures.\nSand size: dominantly medium sand or coarser\nAverage content of clay: 15 percent\nReaction: moderately acid to slightly alkaline\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon that is gravelly or very gravelly coarse loamy sand.\n2C horizon:\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 2 to 6\nTexture; commonly loose sand and gravel\nReaction: commonly strongly effervescent and moderately alkaline, but in some pedons it is neutral or slightly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bellechester, Finchford, Fruitfield, Hawick, Komro, Lasa, Sparta, Trempe, and Zumbro series. Bellechester soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone bedrock at depths ranging from 102 to 178 cm (40 to 70 inches) and commonly contain rock fragments of sandstone or limestone within the solum. Finchford, Fruitfield, Sparta, and Trempe soils are more acid in the lower sola and lack effervescence in the C horizon. In addition, Sparta soils contain less gravel throughout and have in the control section, 20 percent or less of coarse or very coarse sand, and 30 percent or more of fine sand or finer, and Trempe soils have redder hue in the upper part of the C horizon.. Hawick soils have thinner sola. Komro soils have redox features within the series control section. Lasa soils have less than 5 percent of medium sand and coarser particles and are deeper to carbonates. Zumbro soils have mollic epipedons greater than 61 cm (24 inches) thick, have dominant sand size of medium or fine throughout, and have less than 20 percent gravel in the solum and C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hononegah soils are on stream terraces and adjacent escarpments, outwash plains, terraces, beach ridges on old glacial lake plains, and on valley trains. The soils formed in sandy alluvial or eolian material underlain within 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) by water-sorted sand and gravel. Slope gradients commonly are 0 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 11.1 degrees C (47 to 52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 914 mm (30 to 36 inches)."

In addition Volinia, Warsaw, and Wea soils are finer textured in the upper part of the solum and have argillic horizons. Wea soils also have thicker sola."
