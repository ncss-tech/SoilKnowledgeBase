  "OVERVIEW": "The Hononegah series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy alluvial or eolian material underlain within 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) by water-sorted sand and gravel. These soils are on stream terraces and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches).",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bellechester, Finchford, Fruitfield, Hawick, Komro, Lasa, Sparta, Trempe, and Zumbro series. Bellechester soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone bedrock at depths ranging from 102 to 178 cm (40 to 70 inches) and commonly contain rock fragments of sandstone or limestone within the solum. Finchford, Fruitfield, Sparta, and Trempe soils are more acid in the lower sola and lack effervescence in the C horizon. In addition, Sparta soils contain less gravel throughout and have in the control section, 20 percent or less of coarse or very coarse sand, and 30 percent or more of fine sand or finer, and Trempe soils have redder hue in the upper part of the C horizon.. Hawick soils have thinner sola. Komro soils have redox features within the series control section. Lasa soils have less than 5 percent of medium sand and coarser particles and are deeper to carbonates. Zumbro soils have mollic epipedons greater than 61 cm (24 inches) thick, have dominant sand size of medium or fine throughout, and have less than 20 percent gravel in the solum and C horizon."

The soils formed in sandy alluvial or eolian material underlain within 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) by water-sorted sand and gravel. Slope gradients commonly are 0 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 11.1 degrees C (47 to 52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 914 mm (30 to 36 inches)."
