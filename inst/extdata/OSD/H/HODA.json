  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoda series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from granodiorite and other acid igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

The mean soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 50 to 59 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry between the depths of about 8 to 20 inches from late June or early July until mid-October.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/2, 4/3 or 3/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 4/2, 3/2, 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, or 3/4.
