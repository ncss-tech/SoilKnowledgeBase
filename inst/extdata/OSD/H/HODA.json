  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoda series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from granodiorite and other acid igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
