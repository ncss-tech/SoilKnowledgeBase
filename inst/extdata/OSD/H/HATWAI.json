  "OVERVIEW": "The Hatwai series consists of very deep, well drained soils on hills on plateaus and canyons.  They formed in loess.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 1 to 65 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
