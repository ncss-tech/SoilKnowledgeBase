Rock fragments range from 35 to 85 percent in the major part of the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, and value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 5YR through 10R.  It is medium or strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Hossick soils are on ridges and mountain sides on alpine areas and the margins of alpine areas.  Slopes typically range from about 4 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in moderately thin gravelly or very gravelly medium textured materials weathered residually or locally transported from areas of andesite or similar rocks.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 34 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 46 degrees F."
