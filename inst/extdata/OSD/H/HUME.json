    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to carbonates is 15 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 64 to 66 degrees F. The soils are moist in all parts for 50 to 60 percent of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. at depth of 20 inches. They are dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days or more within the 3 month period following the summer solstice, and are moist in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days or more within the 3 month period following the winter solstice in more than 7 years out of 10.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 1 or 2 moist. It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is clay or clay loam, has 35 to 50 percent clay, and ranges from mainly neutral to mildly alkaline in the Btk horizons in some pedons. The B horizon ranges from 8 to 24 inches.\nThe Bk and BCk horizons have a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry. It ranges from loam to clay, and is mildly to strongly alkaline and moderately or strongly calcareous."

These soils formed in residuum and alluvium from shale and sandstone rocks. The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 22 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F. and the frost-free period ranges from 65 to 85 days."
