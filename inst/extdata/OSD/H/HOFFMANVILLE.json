Average texture of the upper C horizons is silty clay or silty clay loam with thin strata of loam and silt loam in some pedons.  The 2C horizon typically occurs at depths of 24 to 36 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand containing up to 35 percent gravel.  Textures below a depth of 40 inches are fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay."
