Elevation is 100 to 400 feet. The climate is humid, characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 300 days. Horseprairie soils are on the Pioneer geomorphic surface."

If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data available for pedon 89P 199, samples #89P1207-1210 from Curry County, Oregon sampled by NSSL, Lincoln, NE - 12/89.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
