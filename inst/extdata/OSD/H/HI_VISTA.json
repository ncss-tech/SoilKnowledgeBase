The soil between the depths of 6 and 15 inches is usually dry and is not moist in most years for as long as 60 consecutive days in winter and spring. Rock fragments are usually 2 to 5mm in diameter.  No horizon has more than 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nA horizon--10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 dry; 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 moist.  Texture: Loamy fine sand, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam and extremely gravelly sandy loam.\nStructure: Weak granular or platy structure, or it is massive or single grained.\nReaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6; 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6.  10YR 3/4, 4/4; 7.5YR 4/4; 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6 moist.

Coarse fragments: 0 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nReaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline\nOther features: A Cr horizon above the bedrock occurs in some pedons, and a Bt3 or BCt horizon occurs in some pedons."

Rock outcrop is present in some areas.  Elevations are 2300 to 3300 feet.  The climate is arid with long, hot summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches with brief periods of snow.  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 80 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days."

Adelanto soils have less than 18 percent clay and do not have a lithic contact.  Cajon soils do not have Bt horizons and a lithic contact.  Calvista soils are 14 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Machone soils are sandy loam or coarse sandy loam throughout on hills and rock pediments.  Randsburg soils are shallow to weathered granitic rock on hills and rock pediments."
