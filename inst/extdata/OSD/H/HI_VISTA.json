  "OVERVIEW": "The Hi Vista series consists of moderately deep to rock, well drained soils, that formed in residuum from granitic rock.  Hi Vista soils are on hills and rock pediments. Slopes ranges from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

No horizon has more than 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nA horizon--10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 dry; 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 moist.  Texture: Loamy fine sand, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam and extremely gravelly sandy loam.\nStructure: Weak granular or platy structure, or it is massive or single grained.\nReaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6; 5YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6.  10YR 3/4, 4/4; 7.5YR 4/4; 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6 moist.
