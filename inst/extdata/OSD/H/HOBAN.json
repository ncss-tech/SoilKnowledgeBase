Poquita soils lack gypsum accumulations between 40 and 60 inches and have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the particle-size control section. Quay, Reagan, and Stovall soils lack accumulations of gypsum in the lower part of the calcic horizon.

Slopes are plane and gradients are generally less than 1 percent but range up to 3 percent. The soil formed in calcareous loamy or clayey materials mostly of alluvial origin.  The climate is arid to semiarid.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 8 to 12 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 67 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 210 to 240 and elevation ranges from 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices are less than 25."
