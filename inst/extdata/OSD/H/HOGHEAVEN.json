  "OVERVIEW": "The Hogheaven series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, salt and sodium affected soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
