    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent but typically is more than 90 percent.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The control section is usually heavy clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and averages 35 to 55 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume, are generally less than 5 percent, and break down with pretreatment. Gypsum may be present in some pedons in horizons immediately above the shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

They formed in thin parent materials weathered from noncalcareous shale.  Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 6,500 feet.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches but ranges from 10 to 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in April, May, and June.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
