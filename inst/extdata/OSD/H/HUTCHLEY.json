    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Anaud, Bellenmine, Celeridge, Cleavage, Cleavmor, Cropper, Gabica, Gaciba, Genoa, Gerdog, Gidwin, Granquin, Grosschat, Hawkridge, Loope, Mascamp, Melling, Pernog, Pernty, Rozara, Shalcleav, Shalper, Slatter, Tractuff, and Tweener series.\nAnaud and Granquin soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days during the summer.  Bellenmine soils have less than 28 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon and the mollic epipedon is 13 to 25 cm thick.  Celeridge, Gerdog, Hawkridge, and Loope soils lack a subhorizon with more that 27 percent clay.  Cleavage soils have a mollic epipedon that does not include the Bt horizon, a longer frost-free season and a higher average soil temperature.  Cleavmor soils have filaments or masses of calcium carbonate in the argillic horizon.  Cropper soils have a mollic epipedon that is 18 to 25 cm thick.  Gabica soils are neutral to medium acid and have 457 to 635 mm of annual precipitation.  Gaciba soils average less than 22 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Genoa soils have rock fragments that are granitic. Gidwin soils have 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Mascamp soils have lime coatings on the lithic contact, have less than 305 mm of annual precipitation and slopes less than 15 percent.  Pernog soils are very strong in the argillic horizon.  Pernty soils have mollic epipedons less than 25 cm thick.  Rozara soils have 14 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Shalcleav soils have a very channery textural modifier in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Shalper soils have silica accumulation on the rock fragments in the Bt horizon.  Tweener soils are 18 to 30cm to bedrock.  Grosschat soils mollic epipedon does not include any of the subsoil horizons.  Melling soils have an aridic soil moisture regime.  Slatter soils are very shallow.  Tractuff soils have 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate throughout the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hutchley soils are on cuestas, hills, mountainsides, plateaus and ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevation is 3,400 to 9,000 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium, residuum, and colluvium derived from quartz latite, basalt, or related volcanic rocks and  metasedimentary rocks with some loess influence.  The mean annual precipitation is 305 to 508 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 3 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 30 to 90 days."
