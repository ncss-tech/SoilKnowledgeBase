  "OVERVIEW": "The Hillery series is a member of the fine, montmorillonitic family of Pachic Argiborolls. Typically, Hillery soils have very dark grayish brown A horizons about 18 inches thick, reddish brown, clay B2t horizons and basalt bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees to 44 degrees F. and the average summer soil temperature is about 60 degrees F. The solum is 38 to 60 inches thick. Rock fragments make up 5 to 30 percent of the control section and consist of basalt pebbles, cobbles, stones, and boulders. In some pedons there are thin discontinuous lenses with more than 30 percent rock fragments. The pedon is neutral to medium acid. The mollic epipedon is 16 to 22 inches thick. The A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and moist. The B2t horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It is clay with 50 to 60 percent clay. In some pedons the B2t horizon rests on bedrock. Some pedons have thin C horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and moist and chroma of 2 through 6 dry or moist."

Grail, Kubler, and Peninsula soils have less than 50 percent clay in the control section. Also, Kubler soils have calcareous material at depths of 24 to 50 inches. Pagoda soils have 35 to 50 percent clay in the B2t horizon and have an ustic moisture regime bordering on aridic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Hillery soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep basalt mesas and flows at elevations ranging from 8,200 to 11,000 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. They formed in fine textured residuum weathered from basalt. The climate is continental with an average annual temperature of about 40 percent F. and an average summer temperature of about 60 degrees F. Annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches with 60 percent falling in the frost-free season."
