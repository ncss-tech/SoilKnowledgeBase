Mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation is 91 to 107 cm (36 to 42 inches), frost-free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation is 107 to 244 meters (350 to 800 feet) above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Bunkum soils are on slopes of upland drainage ways below the Homen soils. The somewhat poorly drained, fine-textured Marine soils are on less sloping summits. The somewhat poorly drained Oconee soils have a dark surface layer, are fine-textured, and are farther from the drainage ways. The poorly drained, fine-textured Pierron soils are on nearly level interfluves or in slight depressions. The well drained Ruma soils are on convex slopes above the Homen soils."

    "content": "REMARKS: During the initial soil surveys (1970s thru 1990s) of Bond, Jackson, Madison, Monroe, Perry, Randolph, St. Clair and Washington Counties, Homen soils were correlated as either the Hosmer series (Oxyaquic Fragiudalfs), the Muren series (Aquic Hapludalfs), or the Rozetta series (Oxyaquic Hapludalfs).\n1997-1998 (RAL-GRS) Homen series was established and classified as (Oxyaquic Hapludalfs) in Randolph County.\nIn 2009, because of  brittleness described in Hosmer typical pedons from Madison, Perry, Randolph and Washington Counties initial soil survey reports and in a 2007 description of the OSD site,  classification is revised to (Fragic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs).\nBrittleness was also described as an inclusion in the Rozetta 279B (Madison Co. Soil Survey Report 1986) and Muren 453B map unit descriptions (Monroe Co. Soil survey Report 1987)\nIn addition to typical pedons in county soil survey reports other pedons previously described as Hosmer which are located within the Homen geographical extent include:\nUdic moisture regime.\n59IL117001         80IL145009       80IL157129\n59IL135002         80IL157128\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (14 inches), Ap1, Ap2 and E horizons.\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 36 to 234 cm (14 to 92 inches), Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btx1, 2Btx2, 2Bt'1 and 2Bt'2 horizons.\nFragic Soil Properties  106 to 196 cm (42 to 77 inches), Btx1 and 2Btx2 horizons.\nUdic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
