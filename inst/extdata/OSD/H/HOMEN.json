Slopes range from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

The somewhat poorly drained Oconee soils have a dark surface layer, are fine-textured, and are farther from the drainage ways.

Soil Survey Report 1986) and Muren 453B map unit descriptions (Monroe Co. Soil survey Report 1987)\nIn addition to typical pedons in county soil survey reports other pedons previously described as Hosmer which are located within the Homen geographical extent include:\nUdic moisture regime.\n59IL117001         80IL145009       80IL157129\n59IL135002         80IL157128\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (14 inches), Ap1, Ap2 and E horizons.\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 36 to 234 cm (14 to 92 inches), Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btx1, 2Btx2, 2Bt'1 and 2Bt'2 horizons.\nFragic Soil Properties  106 to 196 cm (42 to 77 inches), Btx1 and 2Btx2 horizons.\nUdic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
