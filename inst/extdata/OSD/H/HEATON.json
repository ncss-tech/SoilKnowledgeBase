    "content": "REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Dougherty or Nimrod series. The series was separated based on mineralogy and wetness.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 76 to 126 cm (30 to 50 in) (Bt1 horizon)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 76 cm (0 to 30 in) (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 76 to 229 cm (30 to 90 in) (Bt horizons)\nAbrupt textural change: 76 cm (30 in) (top of Bt horizons)\nAlbic materials: 152 to 198 cm (60 to 78 in) (Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)\nAdditional comments: The Heaton series was proposed in Gillespie County, Texas; however, it was not correlated in the county. The type location was moved to Parker County. Mineralogy was checked at the South Regional Technical Service Center at Fort Worth, Texas.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
