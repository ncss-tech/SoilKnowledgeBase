  "OVERVIEW": "The Heaton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in locally reworked eolian sands over sandy and loamy alluvium. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on stream terraces on river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 828 mm (33 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F).",

The series was separated based on mineralogy and wetness.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 76 to 126 cm (30 to 50 in) (Bt1 horizon)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 76 cm (0 to 30 in) (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 76 to 229 cm (30 to 90 in) (Bt horizons)\nAbrupt textural change: 76 cm (30 in) (top of Bt horizons)\nAlbic materials: 152 to 198 cm (60 to 78 in) (Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)\nAdditional comments: The Heaton series was proposed in Gillespie County, Texas; however, it was not correlated in the county. The type location was moved to Parker County. Mineralogy was checked at the South Regional Technical Service Center at Fort Worth, Texas.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area"
