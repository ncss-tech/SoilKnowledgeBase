  "STATES": "CO,MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hapney series consists of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Hapney soils are on flood plains, terraces, or alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Hapney soils typically have albic horizons but such horizons are absent in some truncated pedons.  Thin A horizons occur in some pedons. Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  The C horizons typically are noncalcareous.  Buried soil horizons occur below the natric horizon in some pedons.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  Continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate do not occur within the control section although inconsistent accumulation of visible soluble salt occurs in the lower solum in some pedons.  E.S.P. ranges from 15 to 40 percent in the solum but decreases with increasing depth in the C horizon.  A 2C horizon of loose sand occurs within a depth of 60 inches in some pedons.   Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and in the C horizon above a depth of 40 inches, but typically are less than 10 percent.\nRock fragments are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from neutral to very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically clay loam or clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt and 15 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  This horizon ranges from mildly alkaline to very strongly alkaline."

Sorum soils have medium to moderately fine textured natric horizons of less than 35 percent clay.  Stumpp soils have mean summer soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F, and overlie sandy-skeletal substratums."
