    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from 40 to more than 70 inches. The argillic horizon averages 6 to 18 percent clay. The eolian material ranges from 40 to 60 inches thick. It is mainly silt and very fine sand with less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser particles. Some pedons have a thin (less than 6 inches) lag layer at the base of the eolian material. It ranges from sand to coarse sandy loam and has 5 to 25 percent by volume of pebbles. The soil moisture control section is dry in one or more horizons for some time in most years.\nThe Oa or Oe horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is partially decomposed or well decomposed litter of leaves, needles, twigs and mosses. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is at least one unit of chroma higher than the overlying E horizon. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B/E horizon has hue, values and chroma of the E' horizon above, and the Bt horizon below. The Bt part comprises 50 to 85 percent of the horizon. The E part is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. The Bt part is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Common or many, faint or distinct clay films are on the faces of peds. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E&Bt horizon is comprised of lamellae. The E part has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bt part has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. The Bt is silt loam or very fine sandy loam, and the E is very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BC or 2BC horizon.\nWhere present, the C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5. It is loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. It has 5 to 10 percent rock fragments by volume. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hillcity soils are on convex surfaces on glacial moraines. They formed in a silty eolian mantle over loamy glacial till. Slopes are mostly complex and range from 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. Elevation ranges from 1,200 to 1,600 feet above sea level."

The Itasca, Warba and Cushing soils have loamy glacial till at depths less than 40 inches (commonly less than 20 inches). These soils occupy similar positions on the landscape. Minor areas of Sax and Cathro soils are in depressions."
