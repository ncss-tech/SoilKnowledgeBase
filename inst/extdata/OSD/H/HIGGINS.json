  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils typically have free carbonate at the surface, but in some pedons, the upper 5 inches are leached.  The percentage of carbonate and gypsum ranges from 40 to 60 percent in the Bky horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt or silt loam, but some pedons are loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bky horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 6 to 8; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Chroma ranges to 8 in some pedons. It has few or common distinct high chroma mottles in the upper part and faint and distinct mottles in the lower part.  It is silt or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 20 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 6 to 8 dry; and chroma of 0 to 2.  In some pedons chroma ranges to 8, which is inherent to nearby reddish sediments.  It is silt or silt loam and neutral to moderately alkaline."

The Barnum and Swint soils are on similar landscapes, and the Nevee soils are above the Higgins soils.  All these soils do not have an aquic moisture regime.  In addition, Barnum and Swint soils are fine-loamy and Swint soils have a mollic epipedon."
