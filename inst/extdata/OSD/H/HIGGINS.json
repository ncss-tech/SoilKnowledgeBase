  "REVDATE": "5/95",
  "STATES": "SD,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Higgins series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium that contains much gypsum.  These soils are on bottom lands.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils typically have free carbonate at the surface, but in some pedons, the upper 5 inches are leached.  The percentage of carbonate and gypsum ranges from 40 to 60 percent in the Bky horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt or silt loam, but some pedons are loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bky horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 6 to 8; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Chroma ranges to 8 in some pedons. It has few or common distinct high chroma mottles in the upper part and faint and distinct mottles in the lower part.  It is silt or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 20 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 6 to 8 dry; and chroma of 0 to 2.  In some pedons chroma ranges to 8, which is inherent to nearby reddish sediments.  It is silt or silt loam and neutral to moderately alkaline."

In addition, Barnum and Swint soils are fine-loamy and Swint soils have a mollic epipedon."
