Lachim, Painter, Quinton, Rinquin and Walco soils have bedrock within 100 cm.  Goldrun soils have fine sand nongravelly particle-size control sections, and are calcareous from a depth of 43 to 90 cm. Grandora soils have Bt horizons with clay films. Incy soils lack gravel and have fine sand particle-size control sections.  Quincy soils have a nongravelly sand to loamy fine sand particle-size control section.  Toll soils have loamy sand nongravelly particle-size control sections.  Winchester soils have nongravelly coarse sand control section and have mineral grains of dominantly dark basaltic particles.  Zorravista soils have a calcareous, moderately alkaline control sections with appreciable amounts of pyroclastic material."
