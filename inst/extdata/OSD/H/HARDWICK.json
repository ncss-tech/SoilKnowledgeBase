The presence of the albic materials and the redox features in the upper most horizons were not formed from present day pedogenesis.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.  Based on color combinations in the glossic horizon some pedons will clasify as aquertic subgroup and are considered taxadjuncts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
