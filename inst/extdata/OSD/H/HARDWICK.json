These soils are usually moist, and are dry 30 to 45 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section.  The particle-size control section average 0 to 25 percent coarse fragments by volume and 35 to 45 percent clay.  Bulk density is 1.40 to 1.80 grams per cubic centimeter.  A perched water table is present above the 2Bt horizon for 120 to 180 cumulative days.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 24 to 40 inches.  Depth to the glossic horizon and redox features is 4 to 10 inches.  The soil to a depth of 40 inches is estimated to have a linear extensibility of 2 to 3 inches.  The glossic horizon is 20 to 30 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 2 or 3 dry.\nThe E/Bt horizon for the E portion has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y moist and dry, value of 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The Bt portion has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It is loam, silty clay loam, or gravelly clay loam.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.  It has 25 to 40 percent clay content.  Albic materials comprise 50 to 85 percent of the horizon.\nThe Bt/E horizon for the Bt portion has value of 4 or 5 moist and 6 or 7 dry.  The E portion has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay, gravelly silty clay, or clay.  Texture of Bt and E material are the same.

Albic material comprise 20 to 50 percent of the horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y moist and dry, value of 4 or 5 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is gravelly silty clay, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  It has 40 to 50 percent clay content."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are the following:\nOchric epipedon\nAlbic horizon - 1 to 7 inches (E horizon)\nGlossic horizon - 7 to 36 inches (E/Bt1, E/Bt2, Bt/E1, and Bt/E2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 12 to 61 inches (E/Bt2, Bt/E1, Bt/E2, and 2Bt horizons)\nOxyaquic feature - perched water table is at its highest depth between November through April and is present for 120 to 180 cumulative days.\nPSCS - zone from 12 to 32 inches (E/Bt2, Bt/E1, and Bt/E2 horizons)\nThe soils formed in relic proglacial lake deposits in a wetter environment.  The presence of the albic materials and the redox features in the upper most horizons were not formed from present day pedogenesis.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.  Based on color combinations in the glossic horizon some pedons will clasify as aquertic subgroup and are considered taxadjuncts.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
