  "OVERVIEW": "The Hyattstown series consists of shallow, well drained soils with moderate permeability.  They formed in residuum that weathered from phyllite in the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F; mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to Cr horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches, and the depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of veined quartz and phyllite range from 15 to 50 percent in the A horizon, and from 35 to 75 percent in the B and C horizons.  The fine-earth fraction of the particle-size control section has greater than 50 percent silt and very fine sand.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is silt loam, clay loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam, loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is dense in place but can usually be dug with hand tools.\nThe R horizon cannot be dug with hand tools."

All of these soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock.  Conotton and Leoni soils formed in glacial deposits.  Dorerton soils are in mixed loess and alluvium over limestone residuum.  Hawksbill soils are on terraces and colluvial fans.  Lutzke soils are moderately deep to sand and gravel.  Oakhill soils formed in residuum from diabase and basalt and are confined to the Culpeper Basin."
