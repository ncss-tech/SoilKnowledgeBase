  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to Cr horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches, and the depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of veined quartz and phyllite range from 15 to 50 percent in the A horizon, and from 35 to 75 percent in the B and C horizons.  The fine-earth fraction of the particle-size control section has greater than 50 percent silt and very fine sand.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is silt loam, clay loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam, loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is dense in place but can usually be dug with hand tools.\nThe R horizon cannot be dug with hand tools."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.\nConotton, Dorerton, Hawksbill, Leoni, Lutzke, and Oakhill series are in a related family.  All of these soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock.  Conotton and Leoni soils formed in glacial deposits.  Dorerton soils are in mixed loess and alluvium over limestone residuum.  Hawksbill soils are on terraces and colluvial fans.  Lutzke soils are moderately deep to sand and gravel.  Oakhill soils formed in residuum from diabase and basalt and are confined to the Culpeper Basin."

The soils formed in residuum of phyllite.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches."

Airy, and Occoquan soils are greater than 20 inches to bedrock.  Codorus and Hatboro soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on floodplains.  Glenville soils are along drainageways and have a fragipan."
