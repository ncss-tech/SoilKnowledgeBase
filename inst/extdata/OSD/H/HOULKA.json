  "OVERVIEW": "The Houlka series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, soils that formed in clayey alluvium. Houlka soils are on flood plains of the Southern Coastal Plain  and the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1430 millimeters (56 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C. (63 degrees F).",
