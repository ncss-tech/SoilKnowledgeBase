  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 6 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to the lithic contact and hard bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Organic matter content ranges from 2 to 6 percent in the surface and decreases uniformly with depth.  The particle size control section is coarse sandy loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay and 50 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent being coarse, very coarse, and medium sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and consist mainly of fine and very fine angular granitic pebbles with less than 5 percent angular cobble.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 43 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 50 to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  Reaction is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C or Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is coarse sandy loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam with 0 to 35 percent fine or very fine angular pebbles.  Because of the cubical nature of the coarse and medium sands, some pedons have a very hard or extremely hard consistence when dry due to packing.  Reaction is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Duncom, Jenkinson, Splitro, and Trump series.  Duncom and Trump soils have pedogenetic Bk horizons, 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section, and formed in materials weathered from limestone.  Jenkinson soils are moderately or strongly alkaline throughout, have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section, and formed in materials weathered from sandstone and shale.  Splitro soils are very similar.  They contain primarily fine, very fine, and some medium sands and formed in material weathered from sandstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hazton soils are on mountain slopes and ridge crests controlled by granite bedrock.  They formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from coarse grained granite.  Slopes 2 - Hazton Series\nare 10 to 40 percent.  Elevations are 6,000 to 9,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 25 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 32 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to be 80 days or less depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage.  Frost can occur at any time."
