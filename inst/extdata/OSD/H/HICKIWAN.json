  "OVERVIEW": "The Hickiwan series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils formed in mixed fan alluvium on relict fan terraces and fan terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
