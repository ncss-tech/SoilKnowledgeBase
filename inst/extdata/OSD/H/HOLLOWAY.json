Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 20 inches (Oi, A and 2E horizons); an albic horizon from 13 to 20 inches (2E horizon); a cambic horizon from 20 to 55 inches (2E and Bt horizon); a particle-size control section from 13 to 43 inches (2E, 2E and Bt horizons).  Holloway soils have a cryic temperature regime and an udic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Montana S-70-Mont. 63-6.
