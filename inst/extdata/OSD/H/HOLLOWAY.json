  "REVDATE": "09/2008",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Holloway series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from argillite and quartzite rock.  These soils have a large component of volcanic ash in the surface layer.  Holloway soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 20 inches (Oi, A and 2E horizons); an albic horizon from 13 to 20 inches (2E horizon); a cambic horizon from 20 to 55 inches (2E and Bt horizon); a particle-size control section from 13 to 43 inches (2E, 2E and Bt horizons).  Holloway soils have a cryic temperature regime and an udic moisture regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Eutrocryepts Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Montana S-70-Mont. 63-6.
