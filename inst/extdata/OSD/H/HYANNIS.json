  "OVERVIEW": "The Hyannis series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills, ridges, and mountainsides.  They formed in cobbly or gravelly materials weathered from soft sandstone and conglomerate.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent in a major part of the solum and any C horizon and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.   These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for some period in nearly every year.\nThe A horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR and mixed colors ranging in value from 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  It is cobbly, very cobbly or very channery with a matrix of loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sand in which there are discontinuous lamella of sandy loam, loam, and sandy clay loam.  This horizon ranges from moderately acid to neutral."

Origo and Troutville soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Yochum soils have sandy loam matrix material and have hue of 5YR or redder."
