  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hyannis series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills, ridges, and mountainsides.  They formed in cobbly or gravelly materials weathered from soft sandstone and conglomerate.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
