They formed in gypseous residuum weathered from rock gypsum of the Castile Formation, with alluvial and eolian inputs of silicate minerals.  Slope range is 1 to 8 percent.  Elevation is 4,000 to 5,500 feet (1,219 to 1,676 m). Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm).   The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F. (17 to 19 degrees C).  The frost-free period is about 210 to 250 days."

Dellahunt and Walkerwells soils are deep and occur on lower positions. Elcor soils do not have a petrogypsic horizon above the lithic contact and occur higher in the landscape.  Joberanch soils have more than 6 inches (15 cm) of silicate material above a petrogypsic horizon and occur on similar landscapes.  Niemahr soils have more than 6 inches (15 cm) of silicate material above a lithic contact and occur on lower positions.  Pokorny soils do not have a lithic contact within 20 inches (50 cm) of the surface and occur on similar landscapes."
