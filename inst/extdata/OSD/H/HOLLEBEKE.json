  "OVERVIEW": "The Hollebeke series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, soils formed in gypseous residuum weathered from the Castile Formation with alluvial and eolian inputs of silicate material. Hollebeke soils are on low hills, and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F. (18 degrees C) and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches (330 mm).",

Dellahunt and Walkerwells soils are deep and occur on lower positions. Elcor soils do not have a petrogypsic horizon above the lithic contact and occur higher in the landscape.  Joberanch soils have more than 6 inches (15 cm) of silicate material above a petrogypsic horizon and occur on similar landscapes.  Niemahr soils have more than 6 inches (15 cm) of silicate material above a lithic contact and occur on lower positions.  Pokorny soils do not have a lithic contact within 20 inches (50 cm) of the surface and occur on similar landscapes."
