  "OVERVIEW": "The Highlonesome series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on alluvial flats, playa steps, playa slopes and playas. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.",
