The mean summer soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  All fragments are gravel size cinders.   The upper part of the particle-size control section (A and 2C) averages over 50 percent cinders and the lower part averages less than 10 percent cinders.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick, except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR and value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  It contains 35 to 50 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR with value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 6 moist and dry.  It contains 60 to 90 percent scoriaceous gravel.\nThe 3C and 4C horizon has hue of 10YR with value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy fine sand or ashy sandy loam.  It contains 2 to 10 percent gravel."

Glass count is low but size fraction in which glass determined (VFS) is very minor in amount.\nParticle-size control section -  2 to 42 inches; averages 42 percent by volume cinders and 15-bar water content (dried) is less than 12 percent.   The family placement (ashy-skeletal) is based on a weighted average.\nThe soil has developed in \"Blue Lake\" and \"Sand Mountain\" tepHra (3,440 years old).\nThe upper part from 2 to 31 inches is glassy and from 29 to 40 inches is amorphic.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available for this pedon.  Reference sample S87OR-031-002 from Jefferson County, Oregon, NSSL, 87P 2709 - 2717.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
