    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist; it is moist in some part of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months.\nThe mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The solum is 12 to 32 inches thick.  The depth to the calcic horizon is 10 to 24 inches.  Rock fragments are mainly pebble and cobble size angular limestone ad sandstone fragments, and generally increases in volume with depth, ranging from 5 to 35 percent in the A horizon, and 35 to 65 percent in the Bw or Btk horizon, and 50 to 90 percent in the Bk horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline and is noncalcareous to depths of 8 to 16 inches.\nThe Btk or Bw horizon (when present) has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly silt loam, very cobbly silt loam, very gravelly loam or extremely cobbly loam with about 18 to 24 percent clay.  The B horizon has 15 to 20 percent pebbles and 25 to 50 percent cobbles.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline, and noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, extremely cobbly loam, extremely cobbly silt loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline and moderately calcareous to strongly calcareous."

Alpowa, Bonnet and Lakewin soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Also, Bonnet soils have soil temperatures of 54 to 59 degrees F.  Copperton soils have calcic horizons that are partially cemented below 20 inches.  Hondee soils average 40 to 50 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Middle soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Stricker soils have 24 to 30 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Tammany soils have a sand or gravel substratum within 40 inches."

These soils formed in alluvium, dominantly from limestone, quartzite, and sandstone.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 68 to 70 degrees F., and the freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches."
