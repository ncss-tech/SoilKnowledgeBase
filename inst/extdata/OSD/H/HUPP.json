  "OVERVIEW": "The Hupp series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from limestone and quartzite.  Hupp soils are on alluvial fans and fan remnants.  Slopes are 1 to 10 percent.  The average precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist; it is moist in some part of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months.\nThe mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The solum is 12 to 32 inches thick.  The depth to the calcic horizon is 10 to 24 inches.  Rock fragments are mainly pebble and cobble size angular limestone ad sandstone fragments, and generally increases in volume with depth, ranging from 5 to 35 percent in the A horizon, and 35 to 65 percent in the Bw or Btk horizon, and 50 to 90 percent in the Bk horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline and is noncalcareous to depths of 8 to 16 inches.\nThe Btk or Bw horizon (when present) has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly silt loam, very cobbly silt loam, very gravelly loam or extremely cobbly loam with about 18 to 24 percent clay.  The B horizon has 15 to 20 percent pebbles and 25 to 50 percent cobbles.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline, and noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, extremely cobbly loam, extremely cobbly silt loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline and moderately calcareous to strongly calcareous."
