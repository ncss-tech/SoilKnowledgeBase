  "OVERVIEW": "The Haystore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in calcareous glacial till on moraines. These soils have slow permeability. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

It has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 1 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E/B horizon has characteristics similar to the E horizon and the Bt horizon.\nSome pedons have a B/E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.
