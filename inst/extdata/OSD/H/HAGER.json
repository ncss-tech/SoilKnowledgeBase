    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hager soils are on lava plateaus. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and tuff. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,590 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

McConnel soils are very deep, sandy-skeletal, have cambic horizons, and occur on lake terraces. Old Camp soils are loamy-skeletal and are shallow to lithic contacts. Pait soils are loamy-skeletal, very deep, have mollic epipedons and cambic horizons, and are on fan remnants beneath escarpments. Riddleranch soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have mollic epipedons and cambic horizons."

The native vegetation is Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, Indian ricegrass, spiny hopsage, and Thurber's needlegrass. Areas with an A horizon less than 13 cm thick support black sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and Sandberg's bluegrass. The above two plant communities occur in complex."
