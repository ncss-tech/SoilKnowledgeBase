  "OVERVIEW": "The Hager series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and tuff. Hager soils are on lava plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the annual temperature is about 8 degrees C",
