Depth to mottles with chromas of 2 or less range from 30 to 48 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has colors with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  The reaction is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has colors with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons have a BE horizon with chroma of 6.  The texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.   The reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E material of the E&B horizon has colors with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The isolated spots of B material make up 20 to 50 percent of the horizon and have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The spots have bridged sand grains and common fine and medium pore.  They are fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.  The reaction is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe Bt/E horizons have colors with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The uppermost 30 inches, mottles are few to common and are red and yellowish red.  Below 30 inches, mottles are gray, light gray, grayish brown, and light brownish gray.  Tongues and vertical streaks of uncoated sand and silt grains make up about 5 to 40 percent of these horizons.  The B21t&A2 and B22t horizons are very fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.  The texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons are mottled gray, yellow, brown, and red.  A few thin streaks and pockets of uncoated sand and silt grains are common.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid."

Soils in similar families include the Bernaldo, Elysian, Fred, Freestone, Frizzell, Leverett, Messer, Ozan, Tippo, and Wanilla series.  Bernaldo, Fred, and Freestone soils are more than 18 percent clay in the control section. Elysian soils do not have tongues extending through the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Frizzel, Leverett, Messer, and Tippo soils have silty particle-size families.  Ozan and Wanilla soils have wetness mottles in the upper part of the Bt horizon."
