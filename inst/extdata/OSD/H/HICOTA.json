The texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  The reaction is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has colors with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons have a BE horizon with chroma of 6.  The texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.   The reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E material of the E&B horizon has colors with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.
