Lafayette soils contain more than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Keller soils are deeper than 114 cm (45 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon.  Mundelein soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Loran soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches).
