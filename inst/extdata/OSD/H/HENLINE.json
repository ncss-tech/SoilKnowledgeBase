  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F, in pedons with an O horizon.  The soils are usually moist and are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to basalt (lithic contact) ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soils have 45 to 85 percent rock fragments by volume of which 10 to 35 percent are cobbles and stones and 35 to 50 percent are gravel.  The amount of stones on the surface ranges from .01 to about 15 percent.  The profile ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.  The A and C horizon are sandy loam or fine sandy loam and have less than 18 percent clay.  The umbric epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, and 4 or 5 dry.  It has weak granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is massive or single grained."

The soils formed in colluvial materials weathered from basic igneous rock.  The soils are in a humid temperate climate having a mean annual temperature of 55 degrees F, and a mean annual precipitation of 70 to 120 inches.  The frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
