They are on linear and convex slope positions at elevations of 35 to 1200 meters (115 to 3937 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2030 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F) and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F).The frost free period is about 150 to 250 days."
