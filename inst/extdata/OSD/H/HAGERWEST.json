Balon, Blancot, Buckle, Cambria, Decolney, Doakum, Forkwood, Fort, Mentmore, Oelop, Olney, Palacid, Penistaja, Potts, Quagwa, Redpen, Spenlo, Sundance, and Teckla soils are more than 40 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact. Bowbac, Cushman, Pokeman, Pugsley, and Spangler series are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Gapbutte and Pawspoc soils are moderately deep to basalt bedrock. Gapmesa soils have mean annual air temperatures below 49 degrees F. Hagerman soils typically have redder hues, darker surface horizons with higher organic carbon, and have moisture patterns which receive slightly more precipitation during late spring and early summer. Los Alamos soils have pumice and ash in the control section. In addition Bowbac, Cushman, Decolney, Fort, Forkwood, Olney, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler, Sundance, and Teckla soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June."
