  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoppers series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale residuum.  These soils are found on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
