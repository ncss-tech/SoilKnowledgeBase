  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hangaard series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in outwash sediments on interbeach areas of glacial lake plains, beach ridges and outwash plains.  Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the upper part and rapid or very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 22 inches.",
