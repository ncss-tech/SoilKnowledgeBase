    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon, and depth to the C horizon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 7 to 30 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand or loamy sand.  With sandy surface textures, the thickness is 10 inches or more.  The reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nRock fragments make up 0 to 15 percent, by volume, of this horizon.\nA Bg horizon is in some pedons.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically has redox features.  It is loamy fine sand or coarser. The reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Rock fragments make up 0 to 35 percent, by volume of this horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, coarse sand, gravelly sand, gravelly coarse sand.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Rock fragments make up 10 to 35 percent, by volume of the horizon.  Stratified layers with fine sand or with more than 35 percent rock fragments are in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on plane or slightly concave positions on glacial lake plains, beach ridges or outwash plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The Hangaard soils formed in a thin, discontinuous, moderately coarse-textured sediment overlying coarse textured outwash.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation from 19 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 675 to 1600 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The Sandberg, Radium, and Syrene soils are the main ones.  These soils have formed in materials similar to those of the Hangaard soils.  The excessively drained Sandberg and moderately well drained Radium soils are on nearby beach ridges.  Syrene soils are in similar positions but have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface."
