    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is more than 60 inches deep and is weakly stratified. The solum typically is about 8 inches thick but ranges from 6 to 10 inches thick. The depth to a perched water table ranges from 2 to 4 feet. The soil is typically strongly saline-alkali and ranges from slightly saline-alkali. Mean annual soil temperature is 64 degrees to 67 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 5Y 6/2, 7/2; 2.5Y 7/2 or 6/2 and moist color of 5Y 4/2, 5/2; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2. It is strongly effervescent or violently effervescent with disseminated lime.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 5Y 7/2, 7/3, 8/2, 8/3, 8/4; 2.5Y 5/2 or 6/2 and moist color of 5Y 5/2, 5/3, 6/3, 7/3; 2.5Y 3/2 or 4/2. Mottles are few to many, fine or medium, distinct or prominent and have color of 5GY 4/1; 5BG 4/1; 5Y 6/4 or 10YR 4/6 moist. More than 40 percent of the moist matrix colors, at depths of 10 to 30 inches, have a chroma of 3 or more when mottles are present in the substratum. Chroma is 2 or 3 when no mottles are present. This horizon is dominantly loamy sand and loamy fine sand with thin horizons of very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. It is slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent with disseminated lime to a depth of 15 inches. It is typically noneffervescent below 15 inches but lime is present in some pedons below this depth."
