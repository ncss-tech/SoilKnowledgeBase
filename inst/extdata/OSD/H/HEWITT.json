  "OVERVIEW": "The Hewitt series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils formed in soft peat materials derived from sedges and moss overlying silty alluvium.  Hewitt soils are in muskegs on floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 32 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the continuous underlying mineral material ranges from 25 to 50 inches.  Strata of mineral material up to 5 inches thick can occur throughout the peat materials.  The mineral strata are commonly silt loam or silty clay loam.  The mineral strata are present on the surface in some pedons.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from neutral to strongly acid.  The pH (0.01M CaCl2) of the organic material is 4.5 or greater within some part of the controlsection.\nThe organic materials have hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist from 1 to 4.  Up to 10 percent coarse woody fragments may be present in the subsurface tier of some pedons.\nThe mineral strata and the continuous underlying mineral material is massive, firm, silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay."
