  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Headrick series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils. These nearly level terrace soils formed in sandy eolian and loamy alluvial sediments of Pleistocene age in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 635 mm (25 in) and mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
