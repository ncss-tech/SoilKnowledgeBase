  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The combined thickness of the A and C horizons is greater than 80 inches.  The surface layer is composed mainly of the topsoil material that was removed from the native soils and stockpiled.  Blocky masses and aggregates in the C horizon are relict native soil and geologic materials.  Fragments of diagnostic soil material averages less than 3 percent between 10 and 40 inches.  Lignite fragments, ironstone fragments, and mica flakes range from few to about 3 percent by volume in most pedons.  Weighted average clay content of the 10- to 40- inch particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Textures are mixed and variable within short distances.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Masses and aggregates of soil material and clayey shale in shades of brown or yellow range from few to common.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 25 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Lignite and ironstone fragments range from 0 to about 10 percent.   Relict masses, aggregates, or mottles from the native soil in shades of red, yellow, brown, or gray range from none to common.  Texture is mainly clay loam but some pedons are loam.  Some pedons contain discontinuous layers, streaks, or masses of loamy sand, fine sandy loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

Similar soils are the Barge (OK), Bigbrown, Distell (T), Diswood (T), Grayrock, Kanima (OK), Marklake, Pirkey, and Thermo (T) series.  Gibbonscreek soils do not have mollic colors in the surface horizon in the majority of pedons.   Barge, Distell, Diswood, Kanima, Marklake, Pirkey and Thermo soils have greater than 3 percent fragments of diagnostic horizons between 10 and 40 inches, and have a udic moisture regime (Udarents).  In addition, Barge soils are in the fine-silty family, Diswood and Thermo soils are in the fine family, and Kanima soils are in the loamy-skeletal family.  Bigbrown soils are in the fine-silty family."

They are on gently sloping to moderately steep slopes with slope gradients ranging from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 240 to 280, and elevation ranges from 300 to 500 feet.  The Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 44 to 64."
