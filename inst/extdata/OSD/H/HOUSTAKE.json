They are warmer than 41 degrees F from March 15 to November 1, and they are dry in this period after July 1.  Depth to the firm brittle layer is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent.  The solum has a phosphate retention of 15 to 25 percent, 10 to 30 glass and glass-coated aggregate, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 0.8 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 10 percent clay, 55 to 75 percent sand and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.\nThe AB and/or Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is ashy loamy sand or ashy sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bq horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It is noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.  It is very firm or firm and brittle.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  In some pedons below a depth of 40 inches textures are very gravelly."

The average January temperature is 30 to 32 degrees F, the average July temperature is 63 to 66 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.
