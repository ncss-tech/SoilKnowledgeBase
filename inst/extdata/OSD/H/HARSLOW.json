    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F. The particle-size control section has a clay content of 18 to 27 percent (field estimate), moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter, greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, 2.0 to 4.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 2.0 to 15 cmol/kg of KCL-extractable aluminum, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air dried). It has 35 to 85 rock fragments.  It is weakly or moderately smeary. The depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Hue is typically 5YR or 7.5YR, but ranges to 10YR. Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon and AB horizon, when present, has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, and 2 to 4 dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam or extremely gravelly medial loam with 15 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe BA horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam or extremely gravelly medial loam with 18 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, very cobbly medial loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam with 20 to 27 percent clay by field estimate. It has 20 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 35 percent cobbles.\nThe BC horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 6 dry. Texture is extremely gravelly medial loam or extremely cobbly medial loam with 15 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 30 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 35 percent cobbles."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harslow soils occur on summits, shoulder slopes, back slopes, and foot slopes of mountains. Elevations are 200 to 2250 feet. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. The soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum from basalt, coarse-grained igneous, and other volcanic rock types. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 130 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 220 days."

Formader soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact, and have a strongly contrasting particle-size class (medial over loamy). Hemcross soils are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments throughout the particle-size control section. Kilchis soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact."
