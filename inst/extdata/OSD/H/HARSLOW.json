  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Harslow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum from basalt and other igneous and volcanic rock types. Harslow soils occur on summits, shoulder slopes, back slopes, and foot slopes of mountains. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F. The particle-size control section has a clay content of 18 to 27 percent (field estimate), moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter, greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, 2.0 to 4.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 2.0 to 15 cmol/kg of KCL-extractable aluminum, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air dried). It has 35 to 85 rock fragments.  It is weakly or moderately smeary. The depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Hue is typically 5YR or 7.5YR, but ranges to 10YR. Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon and AB horizon, when present, has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, and 2 to 4 dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam or extremely gravelly medial loam with 15 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe BA horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam or extremely gravelly medial loam with 18 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, very cobbly medial loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam with 20 to 27 percent clay by field estimate. It has 20 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 35 percent cobbles.\nThe BC horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 6 dry. Texture is extremely gravelly medial loam or extremely cobbly medial loam with 15 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 30 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 35 percent cobbles."
