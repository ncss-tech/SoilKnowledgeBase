  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to carbonates range from 22 to 60 inches. Bedrock is at depths greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments, mainly gravel and cobbles, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the surface layer, from 15 to 55 percent in the upper part of the subsoil, from 35 to 60 percent in the lower part of the subsoil, and from 45 to 70 percent in the substratum. The soil ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the solum and neutral to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nSome pedons have a thin O horizon.\nThe Ap horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture ranges from sandy loam to silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. They have weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure and very friable or friable consistence. Some pedons have an A horizon up to 6 inches thick.\nThe E horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture ranges from sandy loam to silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. They have weak, fine or medium granular, blocky, or platy structure, or the material is massive. They are very friable, friable, or firm. In some pedons, the E horizon is replaced by a BE horizon with chroma of 4 through 6. Some pedons have a EB horizon with granular structure.\nThe E/B and B/E horizons are transitional from the E to Bt horizons in color and texture. Structure is weak to moderate, fine or medium granular, subangular blocky, or platy, and consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam, sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction. They have weak or moderate, fine to coarse, angular or subangular blocky structure, and have very friable to firm consistence.\nIn some pedons a BC or C horizon up to 12 inches thick may lack free carbonates. The C horizon has textures of sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction and is most commonly stratified. Strata include various grades of sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Kars series is the only other member of the same family. Kars soils have a thinner solum and have free carbonates at depths less than 22 inches.\nThe Alton, Belmore, Chenango, Chili, Conotton, Copake, Palmyra, and Phelps series are members of similar families. Alton, Chenango, and Copake soils lack argillic horizons. Belmore, Chili, and Conotton soils lack interfingering of albic material into the argillic horizon. Palmyra and Phelps soils have a lower rock fragment content in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Howard soils are nearly level to rolling soils of outwash plains and valley trains and rolling to very steep soils of kames, eskers and terraces faces. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. These soils developed in glacial outwash deposits containing significant amounts of limestone rock fragments and a broad range in other rock fragments of sedimentary and igneous origin. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 46 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.; and the mean frost-free season ranges from 120 to 160 days. The elevation ranges from 95 to 1800 feet above sea level."

Amboy, Arkport, Dunkirk and Hudson soils and their wetter associates formed in nearby glacio-lacustrine deposits. Bath, Langford, Lansing, Madrid, Ontario and Sodus soils and their wetter associates are on adjacent till plains. Moderately well drained Phelps soils, somewhat poorly drained Fredon soils, and poorly drained and very poorly drained Halsey soils form a drainage sequence with Howard soils."

    "content": "REMARKS: The range of the series was previously broadened to include pedons with a BE horizon underlying the Ap horizon that is similar to a cambic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon.\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 24 to 45 inches (B/E, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\n3. Glossic subgroup - as evidenced by albic materials interfingering along ped faces in the upper part of the argillic horizon (B/E horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
