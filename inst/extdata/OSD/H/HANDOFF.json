  "OVERVIEW": "The Handoff series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material from metamorphic and granitic rocks with a thick volcanic ash mantle on mountain side slopes and drainageways. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and high in the lower part. The average annual precipitation is about 1195 mm and the average annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C (40 degrees F).",
