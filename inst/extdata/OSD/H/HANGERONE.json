    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nDepth to the calcic horizon is 60 to 100 centimeters. These soils have been drained by historic over drafting of groundwater in the Santa Clara valley, and flooding has been controlled by dams and channelization of streams. The mean annual soil temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about June 1 to October 15 (about 135 days). The particle size control section averages 35 to 60 percent clay. Mineralogy is smectitic. The soil is calcareous throughout with slight to violent effervescence. Organic matter ranges from 1 to 4 percent to a depth of 24 centimeters. Surface-initiated reversible cracks 1 to 4 centimeters wide extend to a depth of 25 centimeters from June to October when the soils are not irrigated. Slickensides are not evident in the soil profile but pressure faces occur below the A horizon and in the upper calcic horizon. A fluctuating apparent water table may occur in a few areas at depths of 120 to 160 centimeters from December through April.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 4/1, 3/1, 2/2, 2/1 or 2.5Y 2.5/1. Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 2/1 or 2.5Y 3/1, 2.5/1. Texture is clay, clay loam or silty clay loam. Clay content ranges from 27 to 40 percent. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 and are rounded and gravel in size. Reaction ranges from 7.3 to 8.4.\nThe Bw horizon dry color is 10YR 4/1, 3/1 or 2.5Y 4/1. Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 2/1 or 2.5Y 3/1, 2.5/1. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay and clay. Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent, are rounded and are gravel in size. Reaction ranges from 7.3 to 8.4.\nThe Bk horizon dry color is 10YR 5/1, 4/1, 3/1 or 2.5Y 8/1, 7/2, 7/1, 6/1, 4/1. Moist color is 10YR 4/1, 3/1, 2/1 or 2.5Y 7/2, 5/3, 5/2, 2.5/1. Texture is clay loam, silty clay or clay. Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent. Carbonate content ranges from 10 to 25 percent. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent, are rounded and are gravel in size. Reaction ranges from 7.3 to 8.6.\nThe Ck horizon, if present, has dry color is 10YR 7/3, 7/1, 6/3, 6/1, 5/1 or 2.5Y 7/3, 7/1, 5/3. Moist color is 10YR 5/2, 4/1 or 2.5Y 5/3, 5/2, 5/1. Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay. Clay content ranges from 35 to 45 percent. Carbonate content ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent, are rounded and are gravel in size. Reaction ranges from 7.8 to 8.6.\nThe C and 2Ab horizons, if present, have dry color of 10YR 7/3 or 2.5Y 7/3, 7/1. Moist color is 2.5Y 5/4, 5/3, 5/2. Texture is very gravelly loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam or clay. Clay content ranges from 9 to 25 percent.

Redox concentrations were not readily observable from auger holes but are assumed to occur. The high carbonate environment of the lower Mollic epipedon may be masking the redox. Historically these soils were quite wet seasonally with scattered artesian wells.\nWith artificial drainage, the soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May 1 to November 1 (about 180 days)."
