Falba, Arol, Niotaze and Singleton soils have a paralithic contact between a depth of 20 and 40 inches. Cadell soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick to tuffaceous sediments. Chazos and Gredge soils have Bt1 horizons that are redder and more acid.  Chaney soils are not ponded and have relict redoximorphic features, reddish argillic horizons and mixed mineralology."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping plains with concave to plane surfaces. Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent but are generally less than 2 percent. Soil areas are typically oval shaped depressions that receive water from surrounding soils. The soils formed in alkaline clayey sediments. The mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 67 degrees F. Average annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 32 inches, and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 40 to 50. Frost free period is 230 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 600 to 1300 feet."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in the Waurika series. Classification changed from Mollic Albaqualfs to Aquic Paleudalfs 3/92. These soils do not\nhave a aquic moisture regime however water is perched on the Bt for brief periods during periods with above normal rainfall.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the Ap, A and E horizon - 0 to 11 inches.\n-low chroma and value meet mollic color requirements, however surface is both hard and massive when dry, organic matter content is less than 1 percent, excluding this soil from Mollisol order.\nPale feature - Abrupt textural change at 11 inches.\nArgillic horizon - 11 to 55 inches.\nAquic properties - the E and B horizon, from 7 to 80 inches, have low chroma associated with brown and olive mottles.\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory - Eastland County, Texas, S72TX-133-3(72L072), and data from type location S79TX-133-002(79P917-926).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
