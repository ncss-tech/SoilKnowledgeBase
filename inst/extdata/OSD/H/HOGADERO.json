  "OVERVIEW": "The Hogadero series consists of deep, well drained gravelly soils that formed in highly eroded very old alluvial deposits derived mainly from acid igneous and sedimentary rocks.  They are on ridges and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
