  "OVERVIEW": "The Helmet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived mostly from diorite, rhyolite, and shale.  Helmet soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
