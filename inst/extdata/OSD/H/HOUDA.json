  "OVERVIEW": "The Houda series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in debris slide deposits derived from sandstone and mudstone. Houda soils are on steep and very steep hill slopes and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1900 millimeters (75 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
