Gateview, Harcany, Poleline, and Snopoc soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Busterback soils have 10 to 18 percent clay and 50 to 75 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Hobacker, Lionhead, and Tonigut soils are calcareous within 100 cm. Baconcamp, Croesus, Nagitsy, and Namela, soils have bedrock within 100 cm. Lolon soils have loose sand at a depth of less than 100 cm. Papaspila soils have summer soil temperatures of 7 to 8 degrees C. and have 35 to 85 percent rock fragments, mainly cobble-sized and are in a 640 to 900 mm precipitation zone.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hapgood soils are on smooth to concave hills, mountains, plateaus, and ridges with north aspects. They formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from mixed or volcanic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash. In Montana they have formed in glacial till. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,707 to 3,048 meters. Climate is cold, semiarid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 610 mm that comes largely as winter snow.  Additional moisture may be derived as a result of snow accumulation through drifting in the area. The mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C and the frost-free period is less than 70 days."

Home Camp soils are clayey-skeletal, moderately deep to paralithic contacts, and have argillic horizons and thin mollic epipedons. Newlands soils are fine-loamy, deep to lithic contacts, and have argillic horizons and thin mollic epipedons."
