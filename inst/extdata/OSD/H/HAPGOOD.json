  "OVERVIEW": "The Hapgood series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed mainly in colluvium and residuum derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Hapgood soils are on hills, mountains, plateaus, and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

They formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from mixed or volcanic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash. In Montana they have formed in glacial till. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,707 to 3,048 meters. Climate is cold, semiarid with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 610 mm that comes largely as winter snow.  Additional moisture may be derived as a result of snow accumulation through drifting in the area. The mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C and the frost-free period is less than 70 days."
