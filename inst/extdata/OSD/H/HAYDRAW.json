  "OVERVIEW": "The Haydraw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous silty alluvial deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
