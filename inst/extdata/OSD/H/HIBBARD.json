  "OVERVIEW": "The Hibbard series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Hibbard soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

It is silt loam and gravelly silty clay loam and contains 20 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay and contains 45 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2BCk horizon has value of 4 through 6 moist and dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It silty clay loam or clay loam.

There is an absolute difference in percent clay of 15 percent or more between the AB and 2Bt1 horizons (Abruptic).\nThis soil is on the Dolph geomorphic surface.\nNSTH 17, RECLASSIFICATION ONLY, 3/95\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
