    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry in all parts between about 4 to 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  There is an absolute increase in clay of 15 percent or more within one inch between the A and B horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam and gravelly silty clay loam and contains 20 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay and contains 45 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2BCk horizon has value of 4 through 6 moist and dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is weakly to violently effervescent.\nThe 3Ckqm horizon is indurated throughout or indurated in the upper few inches and weak to strongly cemented below. It is massive or platy."

The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F, mean summer , temperature is 60 to 70 degrees F, and mean winter temperature is 24 to 28 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."

Gwinly and Immig soils are clayey-skeletal, lack a duripan and are located on adjacent uplands.  Pritchard soils are deep and are located on adjacent uplands.  Virtue soils are fine-silty, have ochric epipedons and are located on adjacent lower terraces."

There is an absolute difference in percent clay of 15 percent or more between the AB and 2Bt1 horizons (Abruptic).\nThis soil is on the Dolph geomorphic surface.\nNSTH 17, RECLASSIFICATION ONLY, 3/95\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
