    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Halvert soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on footslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from basalt or andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 1,880 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
