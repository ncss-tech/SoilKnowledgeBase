  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Typically this soil is moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout.  Depth to water table ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to lithologic discontinuity ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 (3 moist), and chroma of 2 through 4.  Calcium carbonate in the form of threads and concretions may be present.  Electrical conductivity of extract is less than 2 dS/m (mmhos/cm).\nThe Bkss horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 (3 or 4 moist), and chroma of 4 through 6.  Calcium carbonate in the form of films, threads, and concretions range from few to common.  Pressure faces range from few to many.  Salt accumulations range from few to common masses of crystals and electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 8 dS/m (mmhos/cm).\nThe C horizon, where present, is similar to the B horizon but contains stratification of coarser materials.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 8 (4 through 7 moist), and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is sand, coarse sand, or loamy sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Heman soils are on nearly level flood plains of major drains and their tributaries of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C). They formed in recent calcareous and saline clayey alluvial fan sediments at the mouth of drains from Permian red bed material which have been deposited over stratified sandy alluvial sediments.  Slopes are mainly less than 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 32 to 44."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the similar Beckman (OK) series and the Gracemore (OK), Knoco(OK), Lincoln (OK), and Vernon (OK) series.  Beckman soils are along drainageways at slightly higher elevations.  Knoco and Vernon soils formed in shales and clays of the Permian age on adjacent uplands.  Gracemore and Lincoln soils are lower in elevation and formed in recent sandy alluvial sediments along major drains.  They have a sandy textural control section and Gracemore soils have a high water table."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Heman soils are moderately well drained.  Runoff is negligible and permeability is very slow.  These soils are occasionally flooded for very brief periods during April through October.  Depth to a water table ranges from 30 to 50 inches from November through May."
