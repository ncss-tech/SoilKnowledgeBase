  "OVERVIEW": "The Hawkins series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from tuffaceous sandstone and tuffaceous limestone.  These soils are on foothill slopes, alluvial fans and high lake terraces.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to more than 30 inches thick.  Depth to the top of the Cca horizon ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature ranges from 64 to 66 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 50 to 80 consecutive days during the later part of the summer.  Cracks, 1 to 5 cm. wide at a depth of 50 cm. are more than 30 cm. long, extend upward to the surface or the base of an Ap horizon and open and close annually.  Gilgai micro-relief is evident in undisturbed areas.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.  It ranges from heavy clay loam to heavy silty clay loam.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B2 horizon has dominant hue of 2.5Y or 10YR (some pedons have hue of 5Y in some part), value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4 dry, 1 through 3 moist.  It is clay, silty clay, heavy clay loam or heavy silty clay loam and has few to many slickensides.  This horizon is noncalcareous to slightly calcareous, and ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.  It ranges from 19 to more than 40 inches thick.\nThe Cca horizon has dominant hue of 2.5Y (some pedons have hue of 10YR in some part), value of 4 through 8 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It ranges from clay to clay loam or silty clay loam and has lenses of loam, silt loam, or sandy loam in some pedons.  This horizon is moderately or strongly calcareous, and ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline."

Slope gradients are 3 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and alluvium weathered from tuffaceous sandstone and tuffaceous limestone.  The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 60 to 66 degrees F., and the frost-free period ranges from 80 to 100 days."
