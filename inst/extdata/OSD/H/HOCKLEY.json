The series description was updated during the soil data join and recorrelation initiative in 2014. MLRA 150 Soil Survey office sampled and redescribed the typical pedon during the update of MLRA 150A. The surface texture was changed from a fine sandy loam to a loamy fine sand.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S00TX-473-1 from Waller County, Texas.\nThe mineralogy is supported by laboratory data on sample 72TX-101-3 (72L107).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data from the Texas A&M University Soil Characterization Lab on sample S00TX-473-1 and the National Soil Survey Lab on sample 72TX-101-3 (72L107)\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
