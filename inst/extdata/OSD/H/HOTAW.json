The Bigridge, Cohasset, Holland, Hospiter, Pasturerock and Sitton soils do not have a root-restrictive bedrock contact within 100 cm. Millerridge soils have significant amounts of magnesium-rich minerals and form from ultramafic rock. Minniecreek soils have coarse plus very coarse sand content less than 15 percent in the particle size control section. Speaker soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 60 to 90 days following the summer solstice. Willakenzie soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 45 to 60 days following the summer solstice."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hotaw soils are on linear to convex backslopes and shoulders of mountains and hills at elevations of 550 to 1600 meters. In some areas with north aspects the elevation is as low as 350 meters. Slope is 2 to 75 percent. Rock outcrops are common. The underlying rock is quartz diorite or granodiorite. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 800 to 1800 mm, of which 2 to 15 percent occurs as snow. Mean annual air temperature is 11 to 15 degrees C, average January temperature is about 6 degrees C, average July temperature is about 23 degrees C. Frost-free season is 165 to 255 days."
