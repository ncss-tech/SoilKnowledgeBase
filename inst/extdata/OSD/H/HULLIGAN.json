  "OVERVIEW": "The Hulligan series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in a loamy mantle overlying gravelly glacial outwash. These soils are on outwash plains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees Cand the mean annual precipitation is about 720 mm.",

The depth to gravelly loamy sand and coarser material ranges from 51 to 102 cm. The depth to free carbonates is more than 203 cm. Rock fragment content in the mantle ranges from 3 to 35 percent and from 15 to 75 percent in the underlying sediment.\nSome pedons have and Oa horizon up to 15 cm thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam or their mucky analogues. The rock fragment content ranges from 3 to 10 percent with 3 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 3 percent cobbles and 0 to 2 percent stones and boulders.\nIt is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam or their nongravelly analogues. The rock fragment content ranges from 3 to 35 percent with 3 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 3 percent cobbles and 0 to 2 percent stones and boulders. It is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon with similar hue and value and includes chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 in some Rainy lobe materials. It is very gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand or their gravelly and extremely gravelly analogues.  The total rock fragment content typically ranges from 10 to 75 percent, with 10 to 75 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 3 percent stones and boulders. Thin strata of loamy material are common in this horizon. It is moderately or slightly acid."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hulligan soils have linear or concave slopes on outwash plains and moraines. They formed in a loamy mantle overlying acid, gravelly glacial outwash. The material is from the Rainy Lobe, Superior Lobe or mixed from both sources and is of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 650 to 790 mm. Annual frost free days range from 80 to 140 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 350 to 500 meters."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 4.23 to 42.34 micrometers per second (.6 to 6 in/hr) in the loamy mantle and 42.34 to 423.3 micrometers per second in the gravelly material. Hulligan soils have apparent seasonal saturation as high as 15 cm below the surface during spring in normal years in the poorly drained phase, and as high as the surface during spring in normal years in the very poorly drained phase. In addition, the very poorly drained phase is subject to ponding following periods of snowmelt or high rainfall."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - a zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (A horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 33 inches (Bw horizons); aquic moisture condition - based on a presumed positive alpha-alpha-dipyridal reaction in the upper 20 inches of the profile during some part of the year in most years. These soils do not show the normal reduced low chroma color typical of soil saturation. Isotic mineralogy based upon the 15 Bar moisture/clay ratio of greater than .6 in the control section. The darker colors of the C horizon are due to dark mineral grains. 1/28/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
