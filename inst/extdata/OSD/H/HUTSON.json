  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist between depths of 8 to 24 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The thickness of the ash over the 2C horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The particle-size control section has greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, and 9 to 12 percent 15-bar moisture based on an air-dried sample. The soils are slightly or moderately acid.\nThe A or E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry. It is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loam, or gravelly ashy loam with 5 to 10 percent clay.  It has 3 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. It ranges up to 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part below 40 inches in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry. It is loam or fine sandy loam with 3 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent stones."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nAlbic epipedon - from 0 to 4 inches (E horizon); this horizon is not always present.\nBs horizons - from 4 to 45 inches (Bs1, Bs2, and Bs3 horizons) meet the color requirement for spodic material but the pH is too high for spodic materials.\nParticle-size control section - from 0 to 40 inches (E, Bs1, Bs2 horizons and upper 11 inches of Bs3 horizon)\nAndic properties - from 2 to 47 inches with volcanic glass and glass aggregate estimated to range from 50 to 70 percent.\nField investigation is needed to substantiate a range of characteristics.  Currently the color ranges and pH ranges as described are quite broad and some pedons will qualify as Spodosols.  Separation from the tentative Millerpoint series needs more review.  It is suggested that Hutson soils be defined as having subsoil hue of 7.5YR and 5YR and that the series be considered for a proposed spodic subgroup.  The Millerpoint series be defined as having subsoil hue of 10YR only and not be considered as meeting \"spodic\" subgroup criteria.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
