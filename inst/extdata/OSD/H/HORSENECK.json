  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 48 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Coarse fragments, primarily gravel, range from 0 to 35 percent in the A and B horizons, and from 0 to 50 percent in the C horizon. Depth to redoximorphic features commonly ranges from 18 to 40 inches, but low chroma depletions are below 24 inches.\nSome pedons have a thin Oi horizon present.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Structure is weak to moderate granular, and consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons may have AB or BA horizons.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It has few to many redoximorphic features between 18 and 40 inches, but low chroma depletions are below 24 inches. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Structure is weak to moderate subangular blocky, and consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6, with common or many redoximorphic features. Texture is loamy sand or sand. Structure is weak subangular blocky or massive, and consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 2 to 6, with common or many redoximorphic features. Texture is loamy sand or sand. Strata of loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam may be present in some pedons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid."

Amostown soils formed in lacustrine sediments that are silt or very fine sand the lower solum and substratum. Bernardston, Broadbrook, Nantucket, Paxton, and Wethersfield soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a densic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Horseneck soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils on outwash plains, deltaic deposits, and in glacial lake basins on higher elevations. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in water sorted glacial materials dominated by granitic gneiss, with some basalt and red sandstone and shale. The mean annual temperature is from 45 to 54 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is from 40 to 48 inches. The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Parsippany, Passaic, and Great Piece soils are poorly drained soils found at lower elevations in glacial lake basins. Boonton, Haledon and Rockaway are soils formed in till on nearby uplands."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon).\n2) Cambic horizon - the zone from 2 to 22 inches (Bw horizons).\n3) Oxyaquic subgroup - redoximorphic features as evidence of saturation in the zone from 22 to 27 inches (BC1 horizon).\nHorseneck is proposed to fill a gap in the Riverhead-Pompton-Preakness drainage topo-sequence in an area generally west of the Hudson River in the southern portion of MLRA 144A. The name is a historical reference to a section of western Essex County renowned for its land ownership disputes in the 1700's.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
