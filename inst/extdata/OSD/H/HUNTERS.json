Hunters soils formed in calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Elevations are 395 to 1250 meters. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation 375 to 650 mm, and the mean annual air temperature 7.5 to 1.0 degrees C. The frost-free season is 95 to 135 days."

Cedonia soils lack a mollic epipedon and are on lake terraces.  Chesaw soils have a sandy-skeletal control section and are on outwash terraces. Garrison soils have a loamy-skeletal control section and are on outwash terraces. Hodgson soils are fine-family and are on terraces. Mires soils have a medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section and are on outwash terraces. Molson soils have a medial over loamy control section and are on hills. Republic and Stevens soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Republic soils are on fans and terraces and Stevens soils are on side slopes of hills and mountains. Scala soils have a coarse-loamy control section and have an ochric epipedon and are on terraces."

The soil was originally classified as a Calcic Haploxeroll.  Calcium carbonate percent based on laboratory data.  The description as of 03/04 reflects a revision in horizon designation by removing the lithologic discontinuity as related to ash influence. This surface influence of ash is highly mixed and not readily discernable from the subsoil.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available for this pedon. Sample number 69WA010-1, pedon number 06937; NSSL-Riverside, CA, 2/1972.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
