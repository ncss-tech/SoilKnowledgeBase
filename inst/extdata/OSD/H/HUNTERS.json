Garrison soils have a loamy-skeletal control section and are on outwash terraces. Hodgson soils are fine-family and are on terraces. Mires soils have a medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section and are on outwash terraces. Molson soils have a medial over loamy control section and are on hills. Republic and Stevens soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Republic soils are on fans and terraces and Stevens soils are on side slopes of hills and mountains. Scala soils have a coarse-loamy control section and have an ochric epipedon and are on terraces."

The soil was originally classified as a Calcic Haploxeroll.  Calcium carbonate percent based on laboratory data.  The description as of 03/04 reflects a revision in horizon designation by removing the lithologic discontinuity as related to ash influence. This surface influence of ash is highly mixed and not readily discernable from the subsoil.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available for this pedon. Sample number 69WA010-1, pedon number 06937; NSSL-Riverside, CA, 2/1972.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
