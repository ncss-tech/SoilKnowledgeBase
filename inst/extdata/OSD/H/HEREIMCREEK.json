  "OVERVIEW": "The Hereimcreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary, igneous, or metamorphic rock. These soils are on drainageways, stream terraces, floodplains and valley floors in intermontane basins. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
