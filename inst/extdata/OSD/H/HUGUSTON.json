  "OVERVIEW": "The Huguston series consists of well drained soils that are shallow and very shallow to soft, calcareous sandstone.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from the underlying sedimentary beds.  Huguston soils are on upland hillslope positions and rock controlled pediments.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  These soils are typically calcareous throughout but are leached a few inches in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  The particle size control section is a fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam with 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 45 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragments consist of soft and hard sandstone channers and range from 0 to 20 percent.  About half the coarse fragments break down upon pretreatment or are easily crushed by hand.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  EC is 2 to 4 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Minor segregation of carbonates occurs in some pedons, but segregated lime does not exceed 2 to 4 percent.  Total carbonates range from 2 to 10 percent throughout.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  An AC horizon is present in about one-third of the pedons and when present has the same morphological characteristics as the C horizon except for structure.\nThe Cr horizon consists of soft, calcareous sandstone.  The material is weakly cemented and does restrict most roots.  The soil-bedrock interface is considered to be a paralithic contact.  Discontinuous lenses of lithic sandstone occur throughout the bedded material.  When exposed, the bedrock becomes extremely hard."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Huguston soils are on rock controlled uplands.  They formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from calcareous sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 6,400 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and ranges from 5 to 10 inches.   About half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 95 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."
