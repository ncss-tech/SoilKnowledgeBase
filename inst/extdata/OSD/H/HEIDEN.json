  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are livestock grazing and hay production. Some areas are used for crop production. Improved bermudagrass, grain sorghum, corn, cotton, and wheat are the principal crops. The native plant community is fire-influenced tallgrass plant community, dominated by big bluestem, Indiangrass, switchgrass, eastern gamagrass, and little bluestem. Midgrasses such as sideoats grama, Virginia wildrye, Florida paspalum, Texas wintergrass, hairy grama, and dropseeds are also abundant. A wide variety of forbs add to the diverse native plant community. Mottes of live oak and hackberry trees are also native. Improper grazing will result in a reduction of tall grass dominance and an increase in composition of mid-grasses, unpalatable forbs, and woody species. Most areas have been cultivated, and are now in grass."
