  "OVERVIEW": "The Hibler series consists of very deep and moderately well drained soils formed in transported materials washed from uplands underlain by limestone, granite, or metamorphosed schist.  They are on river terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",
