  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to paralithic contact with soft, weathered bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless surface layers have been limed.  Content of coarse fragments 1/4 to 10 inches in size comprises from 0 to 5 percent of the Ap and Bt horizons.  Some pedons have up to 5 percent iron and manganese concretions in the A and Bt horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of brown or yellow are in part of the Bt horizon of most pedons, as well as masses of iron accumulation in shades of red.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.  In some pedons, there is a thin silty clay Bt horizon just above the Cr horizon.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, and is commonly mottled in shades of gray, yellow, red, or brown which represent iron depletions and accumulations.   Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 with mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray.  In some pedons, the C horizon is mottled in shades of these colors.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is soft, weathered Triassic siltstone, mudstone, or sandstone bedrock that can be dug with difficulty with a spade."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brandon, Choccolocco, and Pickwick series in the same family, and the Brickhaven, Carbonton, Mooshaunee, Claycreek, and Pageland series in closely related families.  Brandon, Choccolocco, and Pickwick soils do not have a Cr horizon.  In addition, Brandon and Choccolocco soils have lithologic discontinuities, which consist of loess over fluvial deposits or Coastal Plain clayey sediments respectively.  Brickhaven and Carbonton soils are fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs.  In addition, Carbonton soils have a Cr horizon at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Mooshaunee and Pageland soils have a Cr horizon within a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Claycreek soils are Alfisols and lack a Cr horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hallison soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep ridges and side slopes in the Triassic Basins of the Southern Piedmont.  Slopes are commonly 2 to 15 percent but range from 2 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from Triassic siltstones, mudstones, and sandstones.  Mean annual precipitation is 47.6 inches and mean annual air temperature is 61.5 degrees F. near the type location."

Mayodan and Creedmoor soils are clayey and lack a Cr horizon.  Pinkston soils contain less clay and are underlain with hard bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  White Store soils are clayey and have a Cr horizon at depths greater than 48 inches.  Granville soils lack a Cr horizon, have lower silt content, and siliceous mineralogy.  Polkton soils are clayey and have a Cr horizon at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
