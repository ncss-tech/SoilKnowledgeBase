  "OVERVIEW": "The Hallison series consists of deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered mainly from siltstone, mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone in the Triassic Basins of the Southern Piedmont.  Permeability is moderate and moderately slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 61.5 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 47.6 inches near the type location.",

Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless surface layers have been limed.  Content of coarse fragments 1/4 to 10 inches in size comprises from 0 to 5 percent of the Ap and Bt horizons.  Some pedons have up to 5 percent iron and manganese concretions in the A and Bt horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of brown or yellow are in part of the Bt horizon of most pedons, as well as masses of iron accumulation in shades of red.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.  In some pedons, there is a thin silty clay Bt horizon just above the Cr horizon.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, and is commonly mottled in shades of gray, yellow, red, or brown which represent iron depletions and accumulations.   Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 with mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray.  In some pedons, the C horizon is mottled in shades of these colors.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.

Brandon, Choccolocco, and Pickwick soils do not have a Cr horizon.  In addition, Brandon and Choccolocco soils have lithologic discontinuities, which consist of loess over fluvial deposits or Coastal Plain clayey sediments respectively.  Brickhaven and Carbonton soils are fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs.  In addition, Carbonton soils have a Cr horizon at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Mooshaunee and Pageland soils have a Cr horizon within a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Claycreek soils are Alfisols and lack a Cr horizon."
