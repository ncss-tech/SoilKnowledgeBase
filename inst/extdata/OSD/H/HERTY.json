The shrinking and swelling of the clayey subsoil generally causes many trees to have crooked trunks. A few areas have been cleared for pasture. Pastures are in common bermudagrass, improved bermudagrass, or bahiagrass."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Lufkin series.  The series was separated based on difference in moisture regime.\nIn the Range of Characteristics, the Btg and Btgss horizons were changed to exclude the 'g' subsurface designation.  This is believed to have been a previous oversight as the Bt and Btss horizons in the Typical Pedon had already been removed of their 'g' designations.\nThis series was updated in 2014 to put into semi-tabular format.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 in)(A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 8 to 76 cm (3 to 30 in)(Bt and Btss horizons)\nParalithic contact: 112 cm (44 in)(2Cry horizons)\nDensic bedrock: 112 to 203 cm (91 in)(2Cdy horizons)\nRedoximorphic concentrations: 8 to 76 cm (3 to 30 in)(Bt and Btss horizons)\nVertic features: slickensides at 53 to 112 cm (21 to 44 in)(Btss and BCssy horizons)\nEpisaturation:  8 to 53 cm (3 to 20 in)  (Bt horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: 112 cm (44 in)(top of the 2Cdy horizons)\nGypsum accumulations: 76 to 203 cm (29 to 80 in)(Btssy, BCssy and 2Cdy horizons)\nAdditional Comments: Aquic conditions do not exist in this soil in normal years.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S80TX-005-009 from Angelina County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL Data from type location in Angelina County, Texas-S80TX-005-009.  Particle-size analysis tests were performed at the project office on three pedons.
