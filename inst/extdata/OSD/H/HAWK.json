Demox soils formed in colluvium derived from basalt and tuff and have 5 to 30 percent stones and cobbles in the A horizon. Drit soils have a Bw horizon and are on mountain slopes with 15 to 75 percent slopes and have a mean annual temperature of about 8 degrees C. Gamboa soils are on uplands with 50 to 100 percent slopes and have a lithic contact between 100 and 150 cm. Goldmountain, , Murken (MLRA 22), and Wrentham soils have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. Hannarocks soils have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 cm. Langrell (MLRA 9 and 10) soils formed in glaciofluvial material and have a Bw horizon. Packard soils average 25 to 35 percent clay in the control section, and have Bw horizons and hues of 7.5YR or 5YR in the C horizons. Plumas soils formed predominantly from metasediments and have mean annual precipitation of about 890 mm. Raster (MLRA 29) soils are on fan aprons with elevations from 1,555 to 2,135 meters (5,100 to 7,005 feet) and mean annual temperature of about 10 degrees C; most of the rainfall occurs as high-intensity, convective thunderstorms during the growing season. Watterson soils formed from volcanic ash and have a hue of 10YR or 5YR in the A horizon, and mean annual temperature of about 7 degrees C."

Frazier soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact, are on mountain slopes with slopes from 15 to 75 percent, and formed in colluvium derived from granite. Gorman soils have a fine-loamy particle-size class and formed in weakly consolidated sediments derived mostly from granitic rock sources."
