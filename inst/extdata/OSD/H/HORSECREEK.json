  "OVERVIEW": "The Horsecreek series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in silty alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",
