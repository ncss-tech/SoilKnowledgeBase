The 01 horizon is lacking in some areas where the natural vegetation has been removed.  THE A horizon has 7.5YR or 10YR hue, and value of 2 or 3.  The B horizon ranges in hue from 5YR through 10YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  The A and B horizons dehydrate irreversibly into black, sharp angular, very hard fine pebble size aggregates."
