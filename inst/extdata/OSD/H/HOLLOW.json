Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent.  Depth to the water table is commonly below 40 inches but will raise to within 20 to 30 inches of the soil surface for more than two weeks during the growing season.  Reaction throughout the profile is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value from 3 through 5 moist, and chroma from 2 through 4 moist.  Texture is silt loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent with 0 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value from 3 through 5 moist, and chroma from 2 through 4 moist.  Texture is sand stratified with lenses of loamy sand and silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 70 percent, with 20 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 30 percent cobble.  Reaction to 10 percent HCl ranges from slightly to strongly effervescent."

Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from sea level to 1000 feet."

Ashmun soils are poorly drained, Skagway soils contain less than 20 percent gravel in the control section, and Tsirku soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Funter soils consist of peat and occur in muskegs.  Lutak soils occur on alluvial terraces and moraines and have a spodic horizon."
