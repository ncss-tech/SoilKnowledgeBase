  "OVERVIEW": "The Hovde series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in marine sediments and gravelly coastal beach deposits.  Hovde soils are on marine terraces and have  slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

It is assumed the sand grains are lithochromatic or mottles are so fragile they cannot be observed and described because pit walls collapse when watertable is deep or the pit is full of water.  Hand \"grab\" samples do not exhibit mottles."
