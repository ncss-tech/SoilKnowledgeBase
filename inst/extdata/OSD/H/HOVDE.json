Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 37 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.

It is assumed the sand grains are lithochromatic or mottles are so fragile they cannot be observed and described because pit walls collapse when watertable is deep or the pit is full of water.  Hand \"grab\" samples do not exhibit mottles.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
