Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 80 percent channers and flagstones throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Colors with value and chroma of 3 derived from parent material rather than a high organic matter content. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon or C horizon where present has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam in the fine earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Balsam, Bloodyhorse, and Mt Rogers series. Balsam soils formed in colluvium and contain fragments of high-grade metamorphic rocks. Bloodyhorse soils have a lithic contact between 20 to 40 inches and have fragments of high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks.  Mt Rogers soils are more than 60 inches to bedrock and have fragments of high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Heintooga soils are on gently sloping to very steep toe slopes, benches, and fans in coves at high elevations in the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B.  Slopes range from 2 to 95 percent. Elevation ranges from about 4,500 to 6,400 feet. These soils formed in colluvium derived from materials weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as metasandstone, phyllite and slate. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 60 to 100 inches. Moist atmospheric conditions are prevalent and fog is common in these high mountain areas."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Luftee, these are the Anakeesta, Breakneck, Cataloochee, Chiltoskie, Guyot, Horsetrough, Oconaluftee, and Pullback series. Anakeesta, Breakneck, Cataloochee, Guyot, Luftee, Oconaluftee, and Pullback soils formed in residuum on adjacent mountain summits and side slopes. Anakeesta soils have a lithic contact between 40 to 60 inches. Breakneck and Luftee soils have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches. Cataloochee soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  Guyot soils have a paralithic contact between 40 to 60 inches. Oconaluftee soils have C horizons of saprolite. Pullback soils have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches. Chiltoskie and Horsetrough soils formed in colluvium. Chiltoskie soils are in a fine-loamy particle-size class. Horsetrough soils are in a sandy-skeletal particle-size class and are poorly drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of this soil is in forest. Common trees are northern red oak, black birch, American beech, yellow birch, black cherry, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, yellow buckeye, red spruce, and fraser fir. In many areas the trees are stunted due to wind and ice damage and a \"windswept\" phase is recognized. The understory species are serviceberry, striped maple, American chestnut sprouts, pin cherry, rhododendron, mountain-laurel, silverbell, blueberry, and flame azalea. Common forbs are hay-scented fern, wood fern, New York fern, Solomon's seal, yellow mandarin, and trillium."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Heintooga series was formerly included with the Balsam series. However, Balsam soils formed in colluvium from high-grade metamorphic and igneous rocks. Although Heintooga soils may exhibit some of the characteristics of andic soil properties, they lack the volcanic glass found in soils of similar taxa in the Western United States.\nRevisions made 9/07(HCD) adjusted OSD to reflect Lab Data.\nThe Heintooga series has the following diagnostic horizons and features:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 61 inches below the surface (Bw and BC horizons)\nIsotic mineralogy class - In more than one-half of the control section, a 1500 kPa water to clay ratio of 0.6 or more and a pH in NaF solution of more than 8.4.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data from NSSC-SSL sample S00NC-173-003.\nNASIS Site ID: 113949\nNASIS Pedon ID: 114790\nNASIS User Pedon ID: Heintooga OSD\nNASIS DMU ID: 410627 (Standard Component Data)\nMLRA = 130B\n02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
