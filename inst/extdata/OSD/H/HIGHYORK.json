    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Highyork soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. Highyork soils are on concave to slightly convex slopes. Elevations range from 600 to 1100 meters. These soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum. Landscapes dominated by Highyork soils have hummocky relief, slips, and intermittent springs. The climate is subhumid with warm,dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1500 to 2550 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 6 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 17 degrees C., and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C. Frost free period is about 200 to 280 days."

Airstrip soils are on convex positons, contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments, and have lithic contact below 50 centimeters. Elkcamp soils contain less than 35 percent clay and are on hummocky slopes."
