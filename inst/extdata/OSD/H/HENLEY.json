  "OVERVIEW": "The Henley series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, somewhat poorly drained, sodic soils that formed in mixed alluvium.

Sodium absorption ratio exceeds 13 percent in all or part of the upper 20 inches of the profile, decreasing with depth below 20 inches. Conductivity is 2 to 8 mmhos per cubic centimeter at some depth above the duripan.  Depth to the indurated duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  This horizon is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and averages 10 to 18 percent clay.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe duripan is platy, about 5 to 36 inches thick, and has an indurated laminar opaline cap and vertical coatings and laminar layers of opal. It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 46 to 49 degrees F.

Calimus soils are also well drained, nonsodic, and lack duripans.  Fordney soils have sandy control sections and are deep.  Hosley soils have natric horizons.  Laki soils lack duripans and exchangeable sodium percentages are erratic throughout the profile."

    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil characterization data on two profiles (S67 Oreg.  18-2 and 18-5) reported in Riverside Laboratory report for Henley soil samples in Klamath County, Oregon, 1967.  Profile 18-5 is the type location.\nNSTH 17, RECLASSIFICATION ONLY, 3/95\nREMARKS:  In 1986, the parhole-size class (family) was changed from fine-loamy to coarse-loamy.  By field texture and PSDA, the clay content is 10 to 18 percent.  However, laboratory data indicate that these soils have a high 15-bar water to clay ratio and 2.5 times the 15-bar water place the soils in a fine particle-size class.  The high 15-bar water content is attributed to kind of parent material of which diatoms make up an appreciable part.  The soil behavior is more like a coarse-loamy particle-size class; therefore, the placement is made on the basis of field estimates and PSDA.\nREMARKS:\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
