  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges form 48 to 50 degrees F.  Sodium absorption ratio exceeds 13 percent in all or part of the upper 20 inches of the profile, decreasing with depth below 20 inches. Conductivity is 2 to 8 mmhos per cubic centimeter at some depth above the duripan.  Depth to the indurated duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  This horizon is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and averages 10 to 18 percent clay.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe duripan is platy, about 5 to 36 inches thick, and has an indurated laminar opaline cap and vertical coatings and laminar layers of opal. It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Henley soils are on low terraces.  Elevations are 4,050 to 4,800 feet.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from diatomite, tuff, basalt, and ash.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 15 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 46 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 110 days."

Calimus soils are also well drained, nonsodic, and lack duripans.  Fordney soils have sandy control sections and are deep.  Hosley soils have natric horizons.  Laki soils lack duripans and exchangeable sodium percentages are erratic throughout the profile."

By field texture and PSDA, the clay content is 10 to 18 percent.  However, laboratory data indicate that these soils have a high 15-bar water to clay ratio and 2.5 times the 15-bar water place the soils in a fine particle-size class.  The high 15-bar water content is attributed to kind of parent material of which diatoms make up an appreciable part.  The soil behavior is more like a coarse-loamy particle-size class; therefore, the placement is made on the basis of field estimates and PSDA.\nREMARKS:\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
