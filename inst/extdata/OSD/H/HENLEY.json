By field texture and PSDA, the clay content is 10 to 18 percent. However, laboratory data indicate that these soils have a high 15-bar water to clay ratio and 2.5 times the 15-bar water place this soil in a fine particle-size class. The high 15-bar water content is attributed to the kind of parent material, of which diatoms make up an appreciable part. The soil behavior is more like a coarse-loamy particle-size class; therefore, the placement is made on the basis of field estimates and PSDA.\n03/2003: The superactive cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\n01/2024: updates to this document were formatting and to the competing series section; The superactive cation exchange activity class was confirmed by KSSL sample 67C0034 (NASIS pedon and user site ID S1967OR035002)."
