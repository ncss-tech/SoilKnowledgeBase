(A horizon)\nhorizon)\nLithic contact: at 15 inches. (upper boundary of the R layer)\nThis revision changes the classification from the mixed mineralogy class to the paramicaceous mineralogy class.  Laboratory data from soils in similar geologic material indicates that mica content in the sand fraction ranges from about 40 to 60 percent (by grain count).\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998.\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
