  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Combined thickness of the A and C horizons are 20 to 35 inches.  Sulfur content is more than 0.75 percent within depths of 20 inches.  Depth to the 2R horizon ranges from 23 to 40 inches.  Reaction before drying ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline and after drying from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A horizon; in the C horizon, from slightly acid to slightly alkaline before drying and from extremely acid to moderately acid after drying.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray and brown range from none to common.  Organic matter content ranges from 5 to more than 10 percent.  Sulfur content of the A horizon is less than 0.75 percent and n value is more than 2.0.    Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, mucky loamy fine sand, or mucky fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, or red range from none to many.  Organic matter content is less than 5 percent.  Sulfur content is more than 0.75 percent and n value ranges from 0.7 to 2.0.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Hard limestone fragments occur randomly throughout the horizon and range from about 20 to 35 percent, by volume.  Solution holes range from none to about three in each pedon.  Where present, they are filled with loamy fine sand and hard fragments of limestone.\nThe 2R horizon is composed of hard limestone that cannot be excavated by a spade."

They formed in sandy marine sediments overlying limestone bedrock under conditions favorable for the accumulation of organic matter.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Near the type location, the average annual rainfall ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F."

The somewhat poorly drained Aripeka soils are on higher adjacent positions, have Cambic horizons, low sulfur content, and are moderately deep to limestone.  The poorly drained Lacoochee soils are on similar positions, lack thick, dark colored A1 horizons, have low sulfur content and weakly expressed spodic horizons, and are shallow to soft limestone.  Weekiwachee soils or on similar positions, are moderately deep to limestone and are Histosols."
