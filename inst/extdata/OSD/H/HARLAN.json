  "OVERVIEW": "The Harlan series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils on relict alluvial fans, terraces, strike valleys and valley side slopes. Harlan soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived from redbed shales and interbedded siltstone and sandstone. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
