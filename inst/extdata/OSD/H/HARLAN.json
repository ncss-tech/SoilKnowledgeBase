  "OVERVIEW": "The Harlan series consists of deep, well drained soils on relict alluvial fans, terraces, and valley slopes.  They formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from redbed shales and interbedded siltstone and sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

PSD                 880414\nOrganic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .8 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with depth.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are typically less than 5 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 5. It is light clay loam or heavy loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It has 6 to about 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent; but when it exceeds 15 percent, the horizon is thin and discontinuous. It is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline."

The Ascalon, Asparas, Bresser, Capulin, Datil, Featherlegs, Moskee, Noden, Palmer Canyon, Recluse, Satanta, Wages, and Wolf soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt horizon.  The Cedak, Dagflat, Hargreave, Hemmingford, Hirac, Kirtley, Rosebud and Ryegate soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  The Critchell, Lavate, and Lorac soils are free of carbonates above 40 inches.  Sugardee soils have gravelly or channery substrata."

These soils formed in calcareous sediments of low aggregate stability derived principally from redbed shales and interbedded siltstone and sandstone.  Elevations range from 3,500 to 6,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 19 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is estimated to range from 95 to 125 days."
