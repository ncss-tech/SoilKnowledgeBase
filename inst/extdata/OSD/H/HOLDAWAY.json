    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The dark surface horizons (mollic epipedon) are 16 inches or more thick and the calcic horizon begins at depths of 16 inches or less.  One or more indurated hardpans are at some depth between 20 and 40 inches. The hardpan layers are 8 to 14 inches thick and contain 36 to 74 percent lime, but the soil above the hardpan contains less than 40 percent lime. Mineralogy of the soil above the hardpan is mixed.\nDepth to high water table ranges from 12 to 24 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is between 47 and 50 degrees F. Mean summer soil temperature is 68 to 73 degrees F.\nParticle-size control section is sicl, cl or sil with more than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Reaction (pH) is 7.4 to 9.0.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, values of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, values of 4 through 7 dry and 2 through 4 moist, and chromas of 1 through 2."

They are at elevations of 4,400 to 4,600 feet above sea level. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 70 F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches. The freeze-free period is 130 to 150 days."
