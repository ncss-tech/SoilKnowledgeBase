Mineralogy of the soil above the hardpan is mixed.\nDepth to high water table ranges from 12 to 24 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is between 47 and 50 degrees F. Mean summer soil temperature is 68 to 73 degrees F.\nParticle-size control section is sicl, cl or sil with more than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Reaction (pH) is 7.4 to 9.0.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, values of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, values of 4 through 7 dry and 2 through 4 moist, and chromas of 1 through 2."

(Bk horizons)\nPetrocalcic - calcium carbonate cemented layers at depths of 20 to 28 inches and 32 to 67 inches. (Bkm horizons)\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998\".  The Holdaway series has not been reviewed in the field since 1967.
