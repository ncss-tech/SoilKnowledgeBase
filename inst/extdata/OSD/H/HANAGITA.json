    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  The solum ranges from 8 to 17 inches thick.  Texture of the control section is dominantly silt loam but includes silt and very fine sandy loam.  There is less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the control section.  Reaction throughout the profile is neutral with pH ranging from 6.6 to 7.2.\nThe A and A/B horizons have moist hue of 7.5Y or 10YR; moist value of 3 or 4, dry value of 4 or 5; moist chroma of 2 or 3.  Thin black (10YR 2/1) organic lenses and pockets of light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) and olive gray (5Y 4/2 and 5Y 5/2) dry are common.  Texture is dominantly silt loam but ranges to include silt or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value from 3 through 5, dry value of 4 or 5; moist chroma from 2 through 4.  Thin pockets of material with moist value of 5 or 6 are common in this horizon.  Texture is dominantly silt loam but ranges to include silt or very fine sandy loam. The 2C horizon has moist hue from 7.5YR to 2.5Y; moist value from 3 to 5; moist chroma from 2 to 4.  Texture includes sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 10 to 35 percent and includes channers, flagstones, cobble and gravel.  Reaction to cold dilute HCl is slightly to non-effervescent.  This  horizon is absent in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hanagita soils are formed in a loess mantle over a thin layer of glacial till underlain by andesite and limestone bedrock.  These soils occur on steep backslope, shoulderslope, and narrow ridge positions on hillslopes.  The climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches, and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature varies from 23 to 27 degrees F."
