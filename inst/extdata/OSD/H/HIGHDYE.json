  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Highdye series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian and alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone over residuum derived from sandstone and shale. Highdye soils are on mesas, cuestas, hills and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Elevation ranges from 6,600 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches with the majority falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and September.
