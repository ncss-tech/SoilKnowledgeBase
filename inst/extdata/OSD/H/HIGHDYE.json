Highdye soils formed in eolian and alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone over residuum derived from sandstone and shale. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,600 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 16 inches with the majority falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."
