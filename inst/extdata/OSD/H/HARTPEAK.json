  "OVERVIEW": "The Hartpeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from mixed volcanic sources. Hartpeak soils are on backslopes of hills. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C. The frost-free season is 210 to 240 days.",
