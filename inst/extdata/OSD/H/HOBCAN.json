  "OVERVIEW": "The Hobcan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from sedimentary and igneous formations.  Hobcan soils are on alluvial fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
