The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and contains 10 to 30 percent rock fragments.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  The solum is very strongly acid throughout.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent soft rock fragments.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, gravelly silty clay, or gravelly clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 10 to 50 percent soft rock fragments."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hazelcamp soils are on broad ridgetops and stable benches of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 400 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."
