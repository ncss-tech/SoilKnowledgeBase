  "OVERVIEW": "The Hazelcamp series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Hazelcamp soils are on broad ridgetops and benches of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and contains 10 to 30 percent rock fragments.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  The solum is very strongly acid throughout.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
