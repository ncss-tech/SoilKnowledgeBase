  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 12 to 24 inches. The mollic epipedon includes the Bt horizon, although some pedons have an A horizon. The particle size control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay, but individual horizons may have up to 39 percent. It has less than 10 percent sand to 60 inches or more. Free carbonates do not occur within 60 inches. Depth of soil development is more than 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 56 to 59 degrees F..\nThe Ap horizon typically is silt loam, but includes silty clay loam. Color value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 1 to 3. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. The A horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Ap horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. In pedons with an A horizon the Bt horizon may not be present. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe upper part of the Btg or 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2. The lower part has hue of 10YR or rarely 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron masses have value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. Some pedons have manganese concentrations and some pedons have iron depletions in the lower Btg horizons. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly alkaline."

Arrowsmith, Bearpen, Frankenmuth, Lafayette, and Muscatune soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 55 degrees F..  Brenton soils have more than 15 percent sand within 40 inches of the surface. Edwardsville soils formed in loess and have less than 7 percent sand throughout. Elburn soils have more than 15 percent sand at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Grundelein soils have more than 15 percent sand and gravel at depths of 24 to 50 inches, have free carbonates at depths of 30 to 50 inches, and have the lower limit of soil development at depths of 36 to 50 inches. Keller soils have more than 10 percent sand in the particle size control section. Lisbon and Lismod soils have free carbonates and more than 15 percent sand at depths 20 to 40 inches, and have the lower limit of soil development at depths of 24 to 42 inches. Mundelein soils have free carbonates and more than 15 percent sand at 20 to 40 inches. Raub soils have free carbonates at 40 to 70 inches and more than 15 percent sand at 22 to 40 inches."

Moniteau soils have an ochric epipedon, are poorly drained, and are in similar positions. Healing soils are well drained and on level areas nearer to the stream channel. Gabriel soils are poorer drained, have a thicker mollic epipedon, and are on similar landscape positions."
