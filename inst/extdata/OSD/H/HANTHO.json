  "OVERVIEW": "The Hantho series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in silty glacial lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains and moraines.  These soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes that range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon, which may include part of the B horizon, ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness.  These soils are generally free of rock fragments.  The particle-size control section has 8 to 18 percent clay and less than 5 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is commonly silt loam but in some pedons it is very fine sandy loam or loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. The texture is dominantly silt loam or very fine sandy loam, but a few thin layers of loam or silty clay loam are in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent and may qualify for a calcic horizon.\nThe Cg or C horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. The texture is dominantly silt loam or very fine sandy loam, but a few thin layers of loam or silty clay loam are in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 15 percent.\nSome pedons have loam and clay loam 2C horizons in glacial till beginning at depths as shallow as 40 inches."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 29 inches.  Frost-free days range from 120 to 160.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 785 to 1950 feet."
