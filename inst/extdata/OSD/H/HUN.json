The Bordengulch, Threebutte, and Venson soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. The Goodlow, Growden, Rubycreek, Twentymile, and Vandamine soils are very deep. In addition the Goodlow soils have an umbric epipedon, the Growden soils have a xeric moisture regime, the Twentymile soils have dense till at 20 to 35 inches, and the Vandamine soils have 2Bt horizons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hun soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 3,600 to 5,400 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from granite with a mantle of volcanic ash.  The soils are in a cool, subhumid climate with relatively dry summers.  The average annual precipitation varies from 35 to 50 inches.  Average January temperature is 22 degrees F; average July temperature is 62 degrees F; average annual temperature varies from 40 degrees to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 50 to 90 days."
