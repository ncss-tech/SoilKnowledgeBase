Secondary lime in the form of films and threads or soft masses occur at depths ranging from 30 to 71 cm (12 to 28 in).  Electrical conductivity in most pedons ranges from 1 to 4 millimhos per cm, but in some saline pedons the range is up to about 16 millimhos.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3).  Moist values are less than 3.5.  It is sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizon is brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2).  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam with clay range of 23 to 35 percent.\nThe C horizon is very pale brown (10YR 7/3), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), brown (7.5YR 5/4), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), or light gray (10YR 7/2).  The C horizon is sandy clay loam or clay loam, with 5 to 35 percent of weakly cemented concretions and soft bodies of calcium carbonate."
