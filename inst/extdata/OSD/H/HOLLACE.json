  "OVERVIEW": "The Hollace series consists of shallow to a petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, ignimbrite, basalt, and volcanic tuffs of intermediate composition.  The Hollace soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
