Most pedons have few to common flakes of mica or fine black minerals in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid in the A and upper B horizons, except where surface layers have been limed, and extremely acid to neutral in the lower B and C horizons.\nThe A or AB horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N and value of 2 or 3.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with or without a mucky modifier.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N, and value of 4 to 7.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Iron or clay depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N, and value of 4 to 7.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.

Texture ranges from sand to clay, but is commonly sandy loam, silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  This horizon is stratified in some pedons.  Iron or clay depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Series in closely related families include Acredale, Argent, Brookman, Cape Fear, Deloss, Gullrock, Hyde, Johnston, Pocomoke, Portsmouth, Roper, Stockade, and Weeksville soils.  Acredale and Argent soils do not have an umbric epipedon.  Brookman and Cape Fear soils are clayey and Cape Fear soils are Ultisols.  Johnston, Pocomoke, and Weeksville soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and except for Pocomoke, lack an argillic horizon.  Deloss, Portsmouth, and Stockade soils are fine-loamy.  Gullrock and Roper soils have a histic epipedon.  Hyde soils are Ultisols."

Elevation is less than 25 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of the areas are cleared, drained, and used for growing corn, soybeans, truck crops, pasture grasses, and legumes.  Native vegetation consists primarily of pine and mixed hardwoods.  Forest overstory species consists primarily of loblolly pine, sweetgum, swamp tupelo, water tupelo, red maple, baldcypress, pond pine, water oak, willow oak, and swamp chestnut oak.  Understory species include waxmyrtle, sweetbay, redbay, switch cane, giant cane, blueberry, and southern bayberry."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Hydeland soils were previously mapped as Hyde soils (fine-silty, mixed, thermic, Typic Umbraquults).  The original type location for the Hyde series was located in Hyde County.  In 1989 three pedons were sampled for characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.  The base saturation at critical depth by the sum of cations method was greater than 35 percent, requiring a change in classification from Ultisols to Alfisols.  The type location site for the Hyde series has been relocated to Tyrrell County, NC and the official series description revised.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 11 inches.  (Ap and AB horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 11 to 58 inches.  (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons)\nAquic conditions - endosaturation and redoximorphic features including masses of iron accumulation and iron depletions in the zone from 11 to 66 inches.   (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, and Cg horizons)\nMLRA = 153B\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for the following pedons: S89NC-095-008 (OSD); S89NC-095-009; and S89NC-095-010\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0272 HYDELAND    0-  2   57- 70  215-250  46- 58     5-  25\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness NC0272 NONE   RARE     0-1.0  APPARENT DEC-APR  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC- NC0272  0-11  VFSL L SIL              0-  0  95-100  5-18   5- 25 NC0272  0-11  MK-VFSL MK-L MK-SIL     0-  0  95-100  5-18  10- 35 NC0272 11-31  L SIL SICL              0-  0  95-100 18-35   5- 15 NC0272 31-58  L CL SIL                0-  0  95-100 12-35   5- 15 NC0272 58-66  SL L SIL                0-  0  90-100  5-35   5- 15\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
