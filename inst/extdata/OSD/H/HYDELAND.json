  "OVERVIEW": "The Hydeland series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils with moderately slow or slow permeability.  These soils formed in silty and loamy marine and fluvial sediments.  They are on broad upland flats and in depressions in the Lower Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. near the type location.",

Series in closely related families include Acredale, Argent, Brookman, Cape Fear, Deloss, Gullrock, Hyde, Johnston, Pocomoke, Portsmouth, Roper, Stockade, and Weeksville soils.  Acredale and Argent soils do not have an umbric epipedon.  Brookman and Cape Fear soils are clayey and Cape Fear soils are Ultisols.  Johnston, Pocomoke, and Weeksville soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and except for Pocomoke, lack an argillic horizon.  Deloss, Portsmouth, and Stockade soils are fine-loamy.  Gullrock and Roper soils have a histic epipedon.  Hyde soils are Ultisols."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Hydeland soils were previously mapped as Hyde soils (fine-silty, mixed, thermic, Typic Umbraquults).  The original type location for the Hyde series was located in Hyde County.  In 1989 three pedons were sampled for characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.  The base saturation at critical depth by the sum of cations method was greater than 35 percent, requiring a change in classification from Ultisols to Alfisols.  The type location site for the Hyde series has been relocated to Tyrrell County, NC and the official series description revised.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 11 inches.  (Ap and AB horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 11 to 58 inches.  (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons)\nAquic conditions - endosaturation and redoximorphic features including masses of iron accumulation and iron depletions in the zone from 11 to 66 inches.   (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg4, and Cg horizons)\nMLRA = 153B\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for the following pedons: S89NC-095-008 (OSD); S89NC-095-009; and S89NC-095-010\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0272 HYDELAND    0-  2   57- 70  215-250  46- 58     5-  25\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness NC0272 NONE   RARE     0-1.0  APPARENT DEC-APR  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC- NC0272  0-11  VFSL L SIL              0-  0  95-100  5-18   5- 25 NC0272  0-11  MK-VFSL MK-L MK-SIL     0-  0  95-100  5-18  10- 35 NC0272 11-31  L SIL SICL              0-  0  95-100 18-35   5- 15 NC0272 31-58  L CL SIL                0-  0  95-100 12-35   5- 15 NC0272 58-66  SL L SIL                0-  0  90-100  5-35   5- 15\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
