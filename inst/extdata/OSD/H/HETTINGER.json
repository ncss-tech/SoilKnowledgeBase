Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.8 degrees C (42 to 46 degrees F)."

The coarser-textured, poorly drained or very poorly drained Bruce soils are on nearby lake plains. The finer-textured, moderately well drained Nester soils, somewhat poorly drained Kawkawlin soils, and poorly drained or very poorly drained Sims soils are on nearby moraines and till plains."
