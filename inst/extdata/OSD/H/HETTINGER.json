  "OVERVIEW": "The Hettinger series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine deposits on lake plains and glacial drainage channels. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
