Burgi soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth. Dearbush, Chambeam, Glean, Pinochle, Sinker, Smidale and Westbutte soils have a lithic contact below 100 cm. Climine soils have silica accumulations in the lower part of the profile. Lambring and Lonecabin soils have a xeric soil moisture regime that borders on xeric. Rondowa soils are slightly acid or neutal throughout.  Shorthike soils have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Webfoot soils are saturated from March through June at 30 to 60 cm with distinct redox features at 20 cm. Willynat soils lack a water table below 150 cm or adjacent contact with streams."

Hourland soils formed in alluvium derived from reworked loess and glacial deposits of metamorphic or volcanic parent material. Slopes are 2 to 10 percent. Elevations range from 1,890 to 2,440 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid, with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 450 mm derived mostly from snow. Vegetation water needs are met either through direct stream access or ground water at a depth greater than 155 cm. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
