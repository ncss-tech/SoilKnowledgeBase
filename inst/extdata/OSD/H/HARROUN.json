  "OVERVIEW": "The Harroun series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained, moderately permeable soils on hillsides and cuestas.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium with some loess influence.  Slopes are 4 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C.",

The Bw in this pedon meets the definition of a cambic, however, the cambic is not diagnostic for the series.  The CCE range for the series needs to be established.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
