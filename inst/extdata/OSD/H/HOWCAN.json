Clanalpine,  Hoskin, Suak, Valmar, and Vitale soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Heechee soils have stones in the Bt horizon and have 25 to 35 percent  clay in the particle size control section. Holmes soils have sola less  than 32 inches thick.  Horrocks soils have sola less than 40 inches  thick.  Pequop soils have the base of argillic horizons deeper than 40  inches and have average annual soil temperature of 43 to 47 degrees F.  Squawtip soils are moderately deep to a paralithic content.  Wambolt soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and receive intermittent summer precipitation for 10 to 20 days cumulative."
