  "OVERVIEW": "The Howcan series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks on mountainsides,  footslopes, and fan terraces.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 12 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F.",
