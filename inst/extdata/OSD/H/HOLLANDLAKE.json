Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 14 inches (E, E/B horizons); an albic horizon from 2 to 6 inches (E horizon); glossic horizons from 6 to 24 inches (E/Bt, Bt/E horizons); an argillic horizon from 14 to 60 inches; a particle-size control section from 14 to 34 inches which is the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon (Bt/E, Bt horizons). Hollandlake soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime. Base saturation (by NH4Oac) is estimated to be 50 percent or more throughout.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
