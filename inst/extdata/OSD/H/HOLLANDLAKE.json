  "OVERVIEW": "The Hollandlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alpine till. These soils are on till plains, moraines, and mountains in glaciated valleys. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
