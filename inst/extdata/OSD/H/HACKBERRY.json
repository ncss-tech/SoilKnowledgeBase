  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum typically is more than 80 inches thick. Content of shell fragments is variable throughout the profile, but ranges from 2 to 15 percent (weighted average) in the 10- to 40-inch particle size control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand, or is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay in overwash phases.  Shell fragments range from none to 15 percent.  Reaction of the A horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3 and has iron concentrations in shades of brown.  Subhorizons of the Bw horizon have chroma of 1 or 2 within a depth of 20 inches of the soil surface.  The Bw horizon is dominantly loamy fine sand, very fine sandy loam, or sand, but at least 1 subhorizon below a depth of 10 inches is very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe BC and BCg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3 and have iron concentrations in shades of brown. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Dianola, Felicity, Mustang, and Peveto series.  All of these soils do not have a cambic horizon.  In addition, Felicity soils have a higher salt content and Peveto soils are better drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hackberry soils are on low ridges generally parallel to the coast, at a elevation of 4 to 7 feet above sea level.  They formed in sandy and loamy beach deposits.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean air temperature is 60 degrees F, and the mean annual rainfall is about 53 inches near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bancker, Creole, Mermentau, and Scatlake series and the competing Peveto series.  Bancker and Scatlake soils are on lower positions and have a very-fine particle-size control section.  Creole soils are on lower positions and have a fine particle-size control section.  Mermentau soils are on lower positions and have a clayey over sandy particle-size control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Hackberry soils are somewhat poorly drained; runoff is slow; permeability is moderate. The water table fluctuates between a depth of 1/2 to 4 feet below the surface throughout the year."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly utilized for pasture and homesites.  Some areas are used for gardens and orchards.  Native vegetation is common bermudagrass, carpetgrass, smutgrass, palmetto, sugarberry trees, and huisache."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly mapped as Palm Beach soils.  Some data indicate these soils may marginally classify in a Fluvaquentic subgroup.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 6 inches\nCambic horizon - 6 to 28 inches.\nAquic Conditions - periodic saturation and reduction from 13 to 61 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: LSU data from Cameron Parish (S84LA-023-001).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
