  "REVDATE": "05/2018",
  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hackberry series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy beach deposits.  These soils are on the toe slopes of low ridges that are generally parallel to the gulf coast shoreline.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum typically is more than 80 inches thick. Content of shell fragments is variable throughout the profile, but ranges from 2 to 15 percent (weighted average) in the 10- to 40-inch particle size control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand, or is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay in overwash phases.  Shell fragments range from none to 15 percent.  Reaction of the A horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3 and has iron concentrations in shades of brown.  Subhorizons of the Bw horizon have chroma of 1 or 2 within a depth of 20 inches of the soil surface.  The Bw horizon is dominantly loamy fine sand, very fine sandy loam, or sand, but at least 1 subhorizon below a depth of 10 inches is very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe BC and BCg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3 and have iron concentrations in shades of brown. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to very strongly alkaline."
