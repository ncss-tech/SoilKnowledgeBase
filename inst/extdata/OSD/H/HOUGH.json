  "OVERVIEW": "The Hough series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian modified coarse textured alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived from igneous rocks.  Hough soils are on lake plains, lake terraces, and fan piedmonts and have 0 to 8 percent slopes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
