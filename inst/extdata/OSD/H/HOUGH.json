Garland soils have horizons of lime accumulation from a depth of 30 to 60 cm and are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  Ornea soils have a gravelly argillic horizon and more than 35 percent rock fragments within 50 cm.  Sharland soils are calcareous and have very gravelly sand at a depth of 25 to 50 cm."

These soils formed in eolian modified alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived from intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks.  The climate is cool, arid having warm dry summers and cold dry winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 cm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C.  The frost-free season is ll0 to l30 days."
