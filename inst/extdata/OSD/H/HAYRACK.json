  "OVERVIEW": "The Hayrack series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from interbedded sandstone and shale, with basalt overburden.  Hayrack soils are on mountain sideslopes, and broad ridge slopes and toeslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 C.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 2.2 to 5.6 C.  Hayrack soils are generally noncalcareous throughout, but may be weakly calcareous in the lower C horizon below 100 cm. Rock fragments range from 5 to 20 percent, and are less than 25 cm in diameter.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent in the particle size control section.  Precipitation is uniformly distributed throughout the year, except from May 15 to July 15, when about one-half of the normal monthly precipitation is received.  Depth to the base of the Bt horizon ranges from 46 to 76 cm.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.   Fine earth textures are fine sandy loam, loam, or clay loam\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.   Fine earth textures are clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry and moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Reaction is slightly alkaline through slightly acid.  Fine earth textures are clay loam or clay."
