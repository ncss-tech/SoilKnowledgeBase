The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F from April through October.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 48 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick and includes part of the argillic horizon.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles with a total rock fragment content of 5 to 15 percent.  It contains 5 to 20 percent glass and glass coated aggregate and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.2 to 0.4 percent.  It is neutral throughout.\nThe 2Btb horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 40 percent clay (estimated).  It contains 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles with a total rock fragment content of 5 to 20 percent.  It is neutral throughout.\nThe 3Btb horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 moist and dry and chroma of 3 moist and dry.  It has 40 to 50 percent clay (estimated). It contains 10 to 30 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles with a total rock fragment content of 15 to 35 percent.  It is mildly alkaline."

Brownscombe soils have developed from granite rock, the Bt horizon contains over 40 percent sand in which over 15 percent is coarse or very coarse sand, texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam or sandy clay.  Bucklake and Perla soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Cagle soils lack the glass and glass-coated aggregate in the surface and have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y in the subsoil.  Correco, Northmore, and Simpson soils are over 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Sherar soils lack the glass and glass-coated aggregate in the surface layer, have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 52 degrees F, and have a frost-free period of 120 to 170 days.  Wicup soils have carbonates at 18 to 22 inches."
