They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks.  Rock outcrops are common.  The climate is cool subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 600 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C.  The frost-free season is about 30 to 80 days."
