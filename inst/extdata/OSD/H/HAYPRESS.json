  "OVERVIEW": "The Haypress series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks.  Haypress soils are on mountain sideslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
