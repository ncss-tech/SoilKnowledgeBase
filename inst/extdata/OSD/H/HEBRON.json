    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hebron soils are on glacial lake basins and stream terraces.  Slopes are dominantly 2 to 6 percent but the full range is from 0 to 6. These soils formed in a mantle of loamy outwash and in the underlying  mostly clayey and silty stratified lacustrine deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 890 mm (26 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 8.3 to 10.6 degrees C (47 to 51 degrees F)."

Andres, Aztalan, and Mosel soils are somewhat poorly drained and are nearby on nearly level or gently sloping areas.  Mosel soils commonly form a drainage sequence with the Hebron soils.  In some places, the somewhat poorly drained Del Rey soils and well drained and moderately well drained Saylesville soils are nearby but these soils have finer-textured sola.  In nearby areas, where the substratum is stratified sand and gravel, are the well drained Fox and moderately well drained Ionia soils."

Permeability is moderate in the loamy outwash and moderately slow in the stratified lacustrine deposits.  These soils have a perched seasonal high water table within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  7/14/04 - A total of 21,406 acres of Hebron soils have been correlated in 10 surveys in Wisconsin.  In 5 of these published surveys, representing almost 2/3 of the correlated acres, the typical pedon has redoxomorphic features (Oxyaquic).  In the other 5 published surveys, the typical pedon has no redoxomorphic features (Typic).  Therefore, this revision redefines Hebron as moderately well drained only and reclassifies it as an Oxyaquic Hapludalf.  A new series needs to be set up for the well drained acres (Typic Hapludalf) when these areas are updated.\nAlso, at least some of the areas correlated as Hebron are formed in loamy outwash over clayey till. This includes at least some of the acreage in the Kenosha-Racine survey and possibly in the Milwaukee-Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington surveys. These areas are outside the concept of the Hebron series. They need to be correlated to another (new?) series when these surveys are updated.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon -  0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (Ap, E ); argillic horizon - 28 to 74 cm (11 to 29 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3 ); other features - albic horizon - 18 to 28 cm (7 to 11 inches) (E);  Oxyaquic feature  redoxomorphic features and saturation at 61 cm (24 inches).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
