  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has color in hue 10YR, value 2, chroma 1, or value 3, chroma 1 or 2; hue N, value 2 or 3; or hue 2.5Y, value 3, chroma 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  The lower 2 to 3 inches of the A1 horizon is not calcareous in all pedons.  A thin calcareous sand or loamy sand horizon is between the A and Btgca horizons in some pedons.  Where present, chroma is 2 or less.\nThe B2tgca horizon has color in hue 10YR, value 4 to 6, chroma 1, or value 7 or 8, chroma 1 or 2; hue N, value 4 to 8; hue 2.5Y, value 4 to 8, chroma 2; or hue 5Y, value 4 to 7, chroma 1 or 2 with or without mottles of yellow or brown.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Weighted clay content of the upper 20 inches of the control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and calcareous.\nThe B3g horizon has color similar to that of the B2tgca horizon.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline and calcareous.\nThe Cg horizon has color in hues 10YR, 2.5YR, 5Y, 5GY, or 5BG, value 5 or 6, and chroma 2 or less.  Texture ranges from sand to fine sandy loam.  In some pedons, there are shells or shell fragments in this horizon.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hilolo soils are on cabbage palm hammocks and along borders of depressions and sloughs.  Slope is dominantly less than 1 percent but ranges up to 2 percent.  These soils are formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments influenced by underlying alkaline materials.  Near the type location, average annual rainfall is about 55 inches and average annual air temperature is about 73 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bradenton, Chobee, EauGallie, Hallandale, Manatee, Pineda, Pinellas, Riviera, Wabasso, and Winder series.  Bradenton, Hallandale, and Pinellas soils occur in about the same landscapes as Hilolo soils. Bradenton soils lack calcareous Bt horizons and are in a coarse-loamy family.  Hallandale soils have limestone.  Pinellas soils have calcareous A2 horizons and Bt horizons between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  EauGallie and Wabasso soils occur in the flatwoods and have spodic horizons. Chobee and Manatee soils have mollic epipedons and are in low areas.  Pineda, Riviera, and Winder soils are in sloughs and broad flats.  Pineda soils have Bir horizons.  Riviera soils have A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick and Winder soils lack calcareous Bt horizons."

The water table is within depths of 10 inches for 2 to 4 months and at depths of 10 to 40 inches for 6 to 9 months in most years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of the acreage of this soil has been cleared.  Citrus is the major crop.  Vegetables are grown in some areas.  Native vegetation is primarily cabbage palm with scattered water oaks and longleaf and slash pines and an understory of waxmyrtle, sawpalmetto, and inkberry.  Pineland threeawn is the dominant grass."

Soils such as these were correlated as a moderately fine subsoil variant of the Parkwood series in the Brevard County, Florida survey.  Locally, the topography where these soils are found is referred to as cabbage palm hammocks.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
