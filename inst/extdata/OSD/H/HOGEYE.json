  "OVERVIEW": "The Hogeye series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic rock. Hogeye soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is 10 to 16 (250 to 410 mm) inches. The average annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F (14 to 16 degrees C).",
