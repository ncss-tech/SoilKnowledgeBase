  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the soil.\nSome pedons have an Oi horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is silt loam to fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate fine or medium granular. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam to sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate fine platy of fine or medium subangular blocky.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam to sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2R horizon is sandstone, siltstone or shale.  In many pedons it is interbedded.  The bedrock is horizontally bedded."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Barto, Glover and Insula soils are in the same family.  Barto and Insula soils have rock fragments dominated by granite.  Glover soils are dominated by rock fragments of shistose, quartzose and phyllite.\nThe Arnot, Catlett, Dimal, Halcott, Klinesville, Nassau, Unicoi and Weikert soils are in related families but all except Halcott have mesic Temperature regimes.  Halcott soils have loamy-skeletal particle size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in a thin mantle of glacial till derived from reddish or brownish, acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 55 inches and the growing season ranges from 90 to 120 days."

Elka, Lewbeach and Willowemoc soils are very deep; Onteora soils are very deep and somewhat poorly drained.  Suny soils are very deep and poorly or very poorly drained.  The Mongaup and Tor soils are on the same landscape.  Mongaup soils are moderately deep.  Tor soils are somewhat poorly drained or poorly drained."
