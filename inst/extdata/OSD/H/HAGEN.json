    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 15 inches (Bw horizon)\nVitrandic feature - the zone from 0 to 15 inches\nLamellic feature - the zone from 15 to 52 inches\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches (lower part of Bw horizon, the E&Bt1, and upper E&Bt2 horizons)\nThe classification of this series revised as of 5/00 from sandy, mixed, mesic Typic Xerorthents to sandy, mixed, mesic Vitrandic Haploxerepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy and recognition of a cambic horizon in the series concept. The 5/00 draft also reflected a change in drainage class from somewhat excessively drained to well drained based on the presence of lamellae and their effect on water movement.\nFurther investigation was completed  in regards to the soil temperature regime. As of 02/2003 the type location has been moved to reflect a more typical habitat and temperature regime.  The original type location resided in an area that has been correlated to Kaniksu, in a frigid soil temperature regime.\nMineralogy changed to isotic 10/01.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
