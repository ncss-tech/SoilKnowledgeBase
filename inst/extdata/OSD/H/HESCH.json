  "OVERVIEW": "The Hesch series consists of well drained soils moderately deep to sandstone.  They formed in a mixture of a loamy deposit and residuum weathered from sandstone.  These soils are mainly in the uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 813 millimeters, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
