The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls in the spring and early part of summer.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 135 days.  In Colorado elevations are 6,000 to 6,800 feet and the frost free period is 75 to 95 days."

Harlem soils have a frigid temperature regime and an aridic moisture regime bordering on ustic.\nType location should be moved to an area considered to have an aridic moisture regime that borders on ustic.  Blaine County is considered to have an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic."
