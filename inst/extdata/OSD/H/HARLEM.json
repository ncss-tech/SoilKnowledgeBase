These soils formed in stratified clayey, calcareous alluvium.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, most of which falls in the spring and early part of summer.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 135 days.  In Colorado elevations are 6,000 to 6,800 feet and the frost free period is 75 to 95 days."
