  "OVERVIEW": "The Harkey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous mixed alluvial sediments derived from sedimentary material.  Harkey soils are on floodplains and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

The average annual temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches; The PE index is about 13.  The frost-free season is 180 to 220 days in New Mexico and as long as 240 days in Texas."

It was suggested that this soil should classify in the great group of Haplocambids or Haplocalcids. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions."
