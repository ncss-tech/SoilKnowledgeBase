  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Harkey soils are on floodplains and stream terraces with slopes of 0 to 3 percent. They formed in calcareous mixed alluvial sediments derived from sedimentary material.  Elevations range from 2,500 to 4,500 feet. Small amounts of gypsiferous material are present. The average annual temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches; The PE index is about 13.  The frost-free season is 180 to 220 days in New Mexico and as long as 240 days in Texas."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nEntic feature - lack of diagnostic horizons\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nWhen the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the description and/or the classification of this series. It was suggested that this soil should classify in the great group of Haplocambids or Haplocalcids. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This description is from a pit near the sampling site for Pedon No. S57NM-8-20 which is now within a cemetery.  The physical and chemical properties of Pedon No. S57NM-8-5-(1 to 6) more nearly represent the central concept of the series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
