The surface tier is partially decomposed moss and sedge peat with between one-sixth and three-fourths fibers after rubbing. The pH (0.01M CaCl2) is 4.5 or greater within parts of the control section. The mineral soil matrix is reduced. Permafrost occurs at 11 to 38 inches. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe O and O part of the O/C horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value moist of 2.5, 2, or 3; chroma moist of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.\nThe Cg and Cg part of the O/Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY or 5G; value moist of 3, 4 or 5; chroma moist of 1 or 2."
