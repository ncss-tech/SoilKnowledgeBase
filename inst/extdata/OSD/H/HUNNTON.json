  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hunnton soils are on fan remnants, ballenas, and plateaus.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and footslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 2,080 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm in Nevada and up to 300 mm in parts of northeastern California and southwestern Idaho.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
