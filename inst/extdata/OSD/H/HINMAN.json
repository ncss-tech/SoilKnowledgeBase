  "OVERVIEW": "The Hinman series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Hinman soils are on alluvial fans and valley sideslopes and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 51 to 55 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 0 to 4 inches and is not deeper than the upper boundary of the Bt horizon.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 10 to 40 inches, but such horizons are not strong enough to qualify as calcic or gypsic horizons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon and these are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically clay loam or clay, but ranges in clay from 35 to 50 percent.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist.  It is typically clay loam or clay with clay exceeding 35 percent to a depth of more than 40 inches.  This horizon is moderate or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth ranges from about 3 to 14 percent."

At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 74 degrees F."
