  "OVERVIEW": "The Highpoint Lake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments on uplands. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is slow or very slow. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
