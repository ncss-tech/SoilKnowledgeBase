  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Fallsington series. Laboratory data indicate a base saturation (by sum of cations) greater than 35 percent, on cropland areas, and a base saturation of less than 35 percent in woodland areas.  Scientists believe the high base saturation in this soil has been caused by long-time cropping practices (liming), and the soil would revert to a lower base saturation if the cropland areas were converted back to woodland.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 3 to 6 inches (A horizon).\nAlbic horizon--the zone form 6 to 13 inches (Eg horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 25 inches (Btg horizon)\nAquic conditions--the zone from 6 inches to a depth of 80 inches is periodically saturated (endosaturation)\nSERIES INTERPRETATION RECORD(S): MD0148\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nMD0148 HURLOCK     0-  2   52- 58  190-210  42- 48     5-  80\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nMD0148 NONE            0-1.0  APPARENT DEC-MAY >-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nMD0148  0- 3  SL                      0-  0  90-100  5-12   3- 10\nMD0148  0- 3  LS                      0-  0  90-100  3- 8   3-  5\nMD0148  3-22  SL                      0-  0  90- 95  8-18   1-  5\nMD0148 22-60  S LS                    0-  0  75-100  3- 8   1-  5\nMD0148 60-66  SR VFSL SICL            0-  0  75- 95 15-30   1-  5\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
