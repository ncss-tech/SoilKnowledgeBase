Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for typical pedon is from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon 52NE079003. Additional laboratory data- National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon 52NE079002, 49NE079010, and 79NE073001.
