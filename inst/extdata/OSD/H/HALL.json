  "OVERVIEW": "The Hall series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in loess or alluvium.  These soils are on uplands and stream terraces of Central Nebraska Loess Hills, MLRA 71. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 660 millimeters (26 inches) at the type location.",
