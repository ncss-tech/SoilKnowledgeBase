  "OVERVIEW": "The Hysoop series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from red calcareous conglomerate or other red sedimentary rock.   These soils occur on eroded fan remnants or hills. Slopes range from 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
