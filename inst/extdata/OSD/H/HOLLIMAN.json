  "OVERVIEW": "The Holliman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitoid. The Holliman soils are on alluvial fans and inset fans. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 210 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
