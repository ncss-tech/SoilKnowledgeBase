The Harstine soils are on the border of criteria for sandy and coarse-loamy families.\n1/2000--The classification was changed from mixed, mesic Vitrandic Durochrepts to isotic, mesic Vitrandic Dystroxerepts based on revisions to Soil Taxonomy. The Bsim horizon was changed to a Bsm horizon.\n1/2013--This official series description (OSD) was updated as part of the soil data join recorrelation initiative. English units were converted to metric units, competing series were updated, 2Bsm horizon was changed to Cd horizon, reference to cementation was removed from 2Cd1 horizon, ashy modifier was added to textures, and standardized Vitrandic subgroup volcanic glass characteristics were added to range of characteristics.\n12/2015--This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015). Most of the changes were in formatting; no major technical changes were made.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nRiverside Soil Survey Laboratory data--73Wash-655-66 and 68 (R7357 and R7366)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
