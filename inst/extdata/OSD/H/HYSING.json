    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Depth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.) Depth to weathered bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F with an O horizon. The soils are moist from mid-September through July, and are dry for less than 25 to 35 consecutive days in August to September in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches. The volcanic ash mantle is 14 to 27 inches thick with volcanic glass content of 30 to 65 percent, acid-oxalate extractable Al + 1/2 Fe of 1.0 to 3.0 percent, phosphate retention of 55 to 90 percent, and 15 bar water retention on air dried samples of 7 to 12 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist or 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. It is 3 to 8 percent clay, and has 0 to 5 percent fine gravel. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist or 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist or dry. Texture is ashy silt loam or ashy fine sandy loam. It averages 3 to 8 percent clay, and 0 to 10 percent fine gravel. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral\nWhen present, the 2Bt or 2Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist or 4 to 6 dry. Chroma is 3 to 6 moist or dry. Texture is fine gravelly sandy loam or fine gravelly loamy sand. It averages 8 to 14 percent clay, and 20 to 30 percent fine gravel. Few thin faint and discontinuous lamellae are present in some pedons. Clay bridging between sand grains ranges from none to 5 percent of the surface of peds. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 moist or 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 3 to 4 moist or dry. Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly coarse sand or very gravelly sand. It averages 2 to 5 percent clay, 75 to 95 percent sand, and 35 to 60 percent gravel (predominantly fine). Reaction is strongly acid to neutral."

The 28 to 31 inch layer is too thin to be considered contrasting and therefore was considered in the calculation of a\nweighted average in the 28 to 42 inch zone.\nThe type location was moved to present location in 2010 to better reflect modal concept.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial laboratory data available - Soil Survey Sample Number: S99WA063003, Spokane County, Washington.
