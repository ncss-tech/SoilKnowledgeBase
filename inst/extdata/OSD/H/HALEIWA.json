  "OVERVIEW": "The Haleiwa series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basic igneous material.  Haleiwa soils are on alluvial fans and in drainageways along the coastal plains.  Slopes are  0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1143 millimeters (45 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C. (73 degrees F.)",
