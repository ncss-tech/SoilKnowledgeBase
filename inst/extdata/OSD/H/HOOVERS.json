(Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm).  (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 18 inches (15 to 46 cm).  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nLithic contact:  The contact with sandstone at 18 inches (46 cm).  (R layer)\nThe classification was changed from Lithic Ustic Haplocalcids to Lithic Haplocalcids April 2004 because the vegetation indicated a drier regime than what was predicted from the precipitation in the area.  The soil moisture regime is now considered to be typic aridic.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Ninth edition, 2003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
