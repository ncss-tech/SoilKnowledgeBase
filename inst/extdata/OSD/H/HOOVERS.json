  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoovers series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loamy slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale over loamy residuum derived from  sandstone.  Hoovers soils are on dipslopes on cuestas and summits on mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

(Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 6 inches (0 to 15 cm).  (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 6 to 18 inches (15 to 46 cm).  (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nLithic contact:  The contact with sandstone at 18 inches (46 cm).  (R layer)\nThe classification was changed from Lithic Ustic Haplocalcids to Lithic Haplocalcids April 2004 because the vegetation indicated a drier regime than what was predicted from the precipitation in the area.  The soil moisture regime is now considered to be typic aridic.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Ninth edition, 2003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
