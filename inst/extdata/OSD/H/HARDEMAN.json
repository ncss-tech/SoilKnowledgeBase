  "OVERVIEW": "The Hardeman series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in moderately coarse textured eolian and alluvial sediments. These soils occur on nearly level to moderately steep treads and risers of stream terraces on dissected alluvial plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
