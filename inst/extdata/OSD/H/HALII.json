  "OVERVIEW": "The Halii series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basaltic rock with admixtures of volcanic ash and ejecta.  Halii soils are on uplands and have slopes of 3 to 40 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 150 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F.",
