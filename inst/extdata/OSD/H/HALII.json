    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  (This needs updating.) These are the Kahanui, Kapaa, Kunuweia, and Pooku series.  Kahanui soils have silty clay or finer texture throughout the B horizon, have moderate structure in the lower part of the B horizon, are less than 40 inches deep to saprolite and lack gravel-size nodules or sheets that contain more than 30 percent gibbsite.  Kapaa soils have weak structure throughout the Ap and B horizons, lack smooth ironstone pebbles, and have less than 40 percent free iron oxide in the control section.  Kunuweia soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 58 degrees F., and plinthite is at depths of 10 to 24 inches.  Pooku soils have strong structure in the A horizon, and have soil temperature of 72 degrees F. or warmer."
