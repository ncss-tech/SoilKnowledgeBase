  "REVDATE": "12/2008",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Huerfano series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that are sodium affected. Huerfano soils formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone. These soils are on summits of mesas, dipslopes of cuestas, valley floors and plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
