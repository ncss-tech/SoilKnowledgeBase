  "REVDATE": "04/2011",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hadden series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived mainly from shale and interbedded sandstone. Hadden soils are on fan pediments and fan terraces of cuestas and structural benches. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
