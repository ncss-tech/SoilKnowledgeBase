  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically the Heyder soils contain 2 to 10 percent rock fragments of mixed lithology.  The amount of rock fragments in the A horizon and in the upper part of the B horizon commonly is less than in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon.  In some pedons, part or all of the A and upper B horizons do not have coarse fragments.  A few scattered cobbles and boulders are on or near the surface in some pedons.\nThe A1 horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak or moderate granular structure.  Where cultivated, part to all of the E horizon is mixed into the Ap horizon.\nThe E horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  It has weak, granular or platy structure.  The A horizon typically is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, but loamy sand and loamy fine sand are included in the range. The sand fraction is dominated by medium and fine sand.  The A horizon is friable or very friable and is slightly acid or neutral.  The E horizon interfingers into the upper part of the B horizon as grayish porous coatings on peds or as 2 to 15 mm wide extensions, or both.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon typically has 10YR hue, and less commonly 7.5YR hue and the lower part has 2.5Y or 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, but subhorizons may be loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sandy clay loam or loam.   The Bt horizon averages between 10 and 18 percent clay, 60 to 80 percent sand, and 10 to 25 percent coarse sand or coarser.  The Bt horizon has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  It is mostly friable but ranges to firm in some subhorizons.  The main part of the Bt horizon is slightly or moderately acid.  Clay films range from patchy to continuous and thin to moderately thick and have value and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe C horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It may contain some mottles.  The C horizon is sandy loam, loam high in content of sand.  Thin discontinuous coarser textured strata and pockets are common.  The C horizon is friable or very friable and is neutral or slightly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Balmlake, Bergkeller, Cunard, Emmet, Flak, Milaca, Nadeau, Oconto, Omena, Sanburn and Sugarbush series.  Balmlake, Cunard, Flak, Milaca, Oconto, and Omena soils have 60 percent or less fine sand or coarser in the argillic horizon.  Bergkeller soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Emmet soils have a reaction of neutral or higher in the argillic horizon.  Nadeau soils, in addition to Bergkeller, Oconto, Omena, and Sanburn, have sand and gravel below the argillic horizon.  Sugarbush soils have 30 percent or more coarse sand or coarser in the argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have convex slopes on gently undulating ground moraines to steeply sloping terminal moraines.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 35 percent.  These soils formed primarily in neutral or slightly alkaline (slightly calcareous) loamy till primarily in the Grantsburg and St. Louis sublobes of the Des Moines lobe, Late Wisconsin glaciation.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches."
