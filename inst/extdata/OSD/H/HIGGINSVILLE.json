  "OVERVIEW": "The Higginsville series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess more than 5 feet thick overlying limestone, shale or sandstone bedrock.  These upland soils have thin deposits of till overlying the bedrock in some places.  Permeability is moderate and slopes range from 2 to 14 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 38 to 60 or more inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The mollic epipedon averages about 20 inches in thickness, but ranges from 10 to more than 24 inches.  Free carbonates are absent in the solum.  Sand content is less than 5 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has dominant hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 2 or 3, and is commonly mottled.  Some pedons have coatings on faces of peds with chroma of 1.  The lower part of the Bt horizon is mottled and has dominant hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Redder mottles of higher value and chroma are present in some places.  It is silty clay loam with clay percentages averaging 27 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam."

Brenton, Elburn, Lawndale, Lafayette, Lisbon, Mundelein, Raub, and Rowley soils have more sand in the lower part of their sola. Harco, Lisbon, and Mundelein have free carbonates at depths of less than 40 inches.  Keller soils have 2Bt horizons that average 6 percent or more quartz sand.  Loran soils have more clay in the lower part of the sola.  Nevin soils have more sand throughout and formed in alluvium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Higginsville soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping upland side slopes, ridgetops, and to a very limited extent, high stream terraces.  These soils formed in loess deposits more than 5 feet thick overlying limestone, shale, or sandstone.  Thin deposits of till cover the bedrock in some places. Slope shapes range from concave to convex but the dominant configuration is plane or concave.  The slope gradient ranges from 2 to 14 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 40 inches."

Macksburg, Sampsel and Sharpsburg soils have more clay in the argillic horizon.  Marshall and Minden soils do not  have an argillic horizon.  Sibley soils are well drained. Macksburg, Marshall, Minden, Sharpsburg and Sibley soils are located on ridgetops above the Higginsville soils.  Sampsel soils are on lower slopes adjacent to drainageways."

The particle-size distribution of the Bt horizon of the typifying pedon is 34 percent clay, 62 percent silt, and 4 percent sand.  (Iron and manganese nodules comprise more than half of the sand size fraction.)\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 19 inches (Ap, A1, A2, Bt1 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 14 to 41 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons); udic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
