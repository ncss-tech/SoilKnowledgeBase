  "OVERVIEW": "The Hermes series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in gypsiferous lacustrine sediments. These nearly level soils are on relict lakebeds on basin floors. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
