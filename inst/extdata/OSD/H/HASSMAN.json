The estimated linear extensibility for the 0 to 40 inch depth (1 meter) is 8.3 cm for the typical pedon, but would range from 6 to 9 cm for the series.\nThe Oa or Oe horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is muck or mucky peat.  It is strongly acid to slighlty acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 and chroma of 1 or is neutral, having value of 2.  It is mucky silty clay loam, mucky silt loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.   It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nA few pedons have an Eg horizon 1 to 6 inches thick.  The Eg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam or clay.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is moderately alkaline or slightly alkaline.  It is slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

These soils formed in clayey and silty calcareous sediments.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 28 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 degrees to 44 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1200 to 1300 feet."

The poorly drained Brickton soils and the moderately well drained Dalbo soils are in a hydrosequence with Hassman soils.  The very poorly drained Dora soils are organic soils that occupy similar depressions."
