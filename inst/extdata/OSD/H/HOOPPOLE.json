  "OVERVIEW": "The Hooppole series consists of very deep, poorly drained, soils formed in loamy outwash and the underlying sandy materials. These soils are in shallow closed depressions on outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters (34 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
