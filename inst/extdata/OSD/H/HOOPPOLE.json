    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 61 centimeters (10 to 24 inches) in thickness. The depth to sandy materials ranges from 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). These soils contain 0 to 15 percent by volume of rock fragments of mixed lithology. Carbonates are in all parts of the fine-earth fraction between 25 and 50 centimeters (10 and 20 inches). The particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 60 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in all parts. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 30 percent.\nThe Apk, Ak, and A horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. They are clay loam, loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe BA, Bg, or Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam, loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Sand content ranges from 75 to 95 percent. It is sand or loamy sand. Some pedons have segregations of carbonates in the form of threads and soft masses. The calcium carbonate equivalent is generally higher in the 2Cg horizon than in the mollic epipedon or cambic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in loamy outwash and are underlain by sandy materials. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 11 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 76 to 97 centimeters (30 to 38 inches). The frost-free period ranges from 160 to 175 days. The elevation ranges from 165 to 311 meters (540 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."
