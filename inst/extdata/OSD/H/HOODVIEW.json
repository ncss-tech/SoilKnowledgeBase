  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoodview series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in medium textured glacial till derived mostly from rocks of the Cascade Andesite Formation. Hoodview soils are on fans and mountain sideslopes in glaciated valleys in the Cascade Mountains.  Slopes  are 5 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 95 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock dominantly is 60 inches or more. Thickness of solum ranges epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. Hue is 10YR but range to 7.5YR in some pedons.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is estimated to have acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and less than 2.0 cmol per kg fine earth of 1N KCL extractable aluminum.  It has 15 to 22 percent clay by field estimate.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly loam or very cobbly loam with 15 to 22 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry.  It is extremely gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, or extremely gravelly sandy loam with 10 to 22 percent clay."

Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in medium textured glacial till weathered mostly from rocks of the Cascade Andesite formation (olivine basalts and olivine-bearing andesites), although material weathered from the Rhododendron formation (tuffs, breccias, and agglomerates) and Columbia River Basalt formation are also present in some areas.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 115 inches, falling as rain in the autumn, winter, and spring.  Rainfall amounts are relatively low in the summer. The mean January temperature is 35 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 63 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F."
