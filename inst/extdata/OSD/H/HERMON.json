  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 14 through 38 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragment content in individual horizons of the particle-size control section ranges from 15 through 75 percent, but the weighted average ranges from 35 to 65 percent. The rock fragments are typically about 1/3 cobbles and stones and 2/3 gravel. Some pedons have stones and boulders throughout the profile. The rock fragment content of the upper 10 inches of the mineral soil ranges from 5 through 50 percent. Stones and boulders cover from 0 through 15 percent of the surface. The surface and subsurface horizons range from extremely acid through strongly acid, the subsoil from extremely acid through moderately acid, and the substratum is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3 and chroma of 0 through 2. It has weak very fine, fine, or medium granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable. It is slightly through highly decomposed plant material (sapric, hemic, or fibric).\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have an A horizon that can be 5 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3. The A horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak very fine through medium granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is commonly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction but the range includes loamy coarse sand. It has weak very fine through medium granular or subangular blocky structure, or it is weak thin or medium platy. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 3 and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe Bh horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 2 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 6.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. A value or chroma of 3 is allowed in the Bs, but not both value and chroma of 3. They are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. The B horizons have weak through moderate, very fine through medium, granular or subangular blocky structure or are single grain or massive where cemented. Consistence ranges from loose through friable, but some pedons have discontinuous cementation.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak very fine through medium granular or platy structure or is single grain or massive. Consistence is loose through firm, but some pedons have discontinuous cementation.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 1 through 4. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak thin or medium platy structure, or it is single grain or massive. Consistence is loose through firm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hermon soils are on glaciated upland plains, hills, and ridges. Slope is dominantly 3 through 25 percent, but ranges from 0 through 60 percent. The soils formed in till derived mainly from granite and gneiss. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 through 50 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 38 through 46 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 90 through 160 days. Elevation ranges from 5 through 2800 feet above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adams, Becket, Berkshire, Canaan, Colton, Monadnock, Stetson, Sunapee, and Waumbek soils. Adams soils are on sandy plains and have fine and medium sand throughout and have less rock fragments. Becket and Berkshire soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments and are in similar landscape positions. Canaan soils formed in similar material and are in higher landscape positions, but depth to bedrock is less than 20 inches. Colton and Stetson soils have stratification in the lower part of the pedon, and are in similar positions on the landscape. Monadnock soils have finer textured surface layers and are in similar positions on the landscape. Sunapee and Waumbek soils are moderately well drained and are in lower positions on the landscape."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly used for forestry. Common tree species include beech, sugar maple, yellow birch, paper birch, gray birch, hemlock, white pine, red spruce, white spruce, and balsam fir. Some cleared areas have had stones removed and are used for pasture, hay, lowbush blueberries, and row crops. Other areas have been cleared of trees, but not stones, and are used for lowbush blueberries."
