  "OVERVIEW": "The Hornsville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy and clayey sediments.  They occur on broad flats, low ridges, narrow side slopes, and stream terraces adjacent to large streams on the Lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

Few to many fine flakes of mica are in the B and C horizons in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, chroma of 1 to 4, or is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a BA or AB horizon.  Where present, thickness ranges from 2 to 5 inches and color is in hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 6, and chroma of 6; hue of 2.5Y, value of 6, and chroma of 4; hue of 7.5YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8; or hue of 2.5YR and 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 6 or 8 with yellow, brown, or red mottles.

Mottles with chroma of 2 or less occur within 24 inches of the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  Texture of the Bt horizons is sandy clay, clay loam, or clay and of the BC horizon sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Few to common streaks or pockets of coarser material are in the Bt horizons in many pedons.  Weighted clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 35 to 60 percent and silt content is less than 30 percent.  Some pedons have a C or 2C horizon below a depth of about 40 inches with the same colors as the BC horizon.  Texture is stratified sandy loam to clay."

Gilead soils have a perched water table at 1.5 to 2.0 feet below the surface for three months each year and have flakes of mica in the argillic horizons.  Angie, Duplin, Esto, and Faceville soils have less than 20 percent decrease of clay within depths of 60 inches.  In addition, Angie soils have mixed mineralogy.  Esto and Faceville soils are better drained and lack chroma 2 mottles within 24 inches of the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  Eulonia soils have mixed mineralogy.  Gritney, Luverne, Nankin, and Remlap soils are better drained; in addition, Gritney, Luverne, and Remlap soils have mixed mineralogy."
