    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Reaction is moderately acid to extremely acid throughout except where limed.  Few to many fine flakes of mica are in the B and C horizons in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, chroma of 1 to 4, or is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a BA or AB horizon.  Where present, thickness ranges from 2 to 5 inches and color is in hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 6, and chroma of 6; hue of 2.5Y, value of 6, and chroma of 4; hue of 7.5YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8; or hue of 2.5YR and 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 6 or 8 with yellow, brown, or red mottles.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 4 to 8; hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, chroma of 6 or 8; 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 6 or 8; hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 6 or 8; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 6, chroma of 4 with yellow, brown, or red mottles.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon and the BC horizon are mottled in the colors above including hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less occur within 24 inches of the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  Texture of the Bt horizons is sandy clay, clay loam, or clay and of the BC horizon sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Few to common streaks or pockets of coarser material are in the Bt horizons in many pedons.  Weighted clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 35 to 60 percent and silt content is less than 30 percent.  Some pedons have a C or 2C horizon below a depth of about 40 inches with the same colors as the BC horizon.  Texture is stratified sandy loam to clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Gilead series is in the same family.  Other competitors are the Angie, Duplin, Esto, Eulonia, Faceville, Gritney, Luverne, Nankin, and Remlap series.  Gilead soils have a perched water table at 1.5 to 2.0 feet below the surface for three months each year and have flakes of mica in the argillic horizons.  Angie, Duplin, Esto, and Faceville soils have less than 20 percent decrease of clay within depths of 60 inches.  In addition, Angie soils have mixed mineralogy.  Esto and Faceville soils are better drained and lack chroma 2 mottles within 24 inches of the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  Eulonia soils have mixed mineralogy.  Gritney, Luverne, Nankin, and Remlap soils are better drained; in addition, Gritney, Luverne, and Remlap soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hornsville soils occur on broad flats and low ridges, narrow side slopes, and stream terraces adjacent to large stream flood plains in the Lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in fine textured clayey sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 and is heaviest in the spring and summer months.  Mean annual temperature is about 65 to 70 degrees F."

Apalachee soils are on river flood plains, lack argillic horizons and have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Blanton, Chipola, Fuquay, Orangeburg, Troup, and Wicksburg soils all are on higher landscapes and with the exception of Blanton soils are well drained.  Blanton and Troup soils have A and E horizons 40 to 80 inches thick, and Chipola, Fuquay, and Wicksburg soils have A and E horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Dothan and Orangeburg soils are fine-loamy."
