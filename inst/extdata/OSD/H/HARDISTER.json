  "OVERVIEW": "The Hardister series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that have moderately rapid permeability.  They formed in ashy alluvium on valley floors and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C., and the average annual precipitation is about 360 mm.",
