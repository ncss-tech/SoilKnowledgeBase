  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from 0 to 4 inches thick (A1 and A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - from 4 to 30 inches (Bt and Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon - from 8 to 30 inches (Btk horizon)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 4 to 24 inches (upper 20 inches of argillic horizon)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nThe temperature regime is estimated from data available in vicinity. The moisture regime is interpolated from 2 year data in the immediate area and longer records from other locations in the vicinity and estimated from the vegetation. (Note during 03/2007 revision: . As originally written, the mean summer temperature crossed from frigid to cryic. The temperature regime is not clear. The air temperatures, elevations,  and associated soils suggest this series is more appropriately in a cryic regime. Vegetation and precipitation suggest this series is in an ustic regime rather than aridic; map unit descriptions range as high as 18 inches of precipitation. The climate regimes of this series need further study.)\nThe classification of the Hickey series when established was fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Borollic Haplargids.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006."
