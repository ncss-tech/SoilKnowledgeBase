  "OVERVIEW": "The Henefer series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from quartzite and sandstone on fan remnants, mountain toeslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon is 20 inches or more thick.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and 35 to 50 percent clay.  The soil is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is more than 60 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It ranges from gravelly or cobbly clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay to gravelly or cobbly clay or to very gravelly or very cobbly clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the lower part. This horizon is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, loam and sandy clay loam and contains 50 to 70 percent rock fragments.  This horizon ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nA C horizon occurs below a depth of 50 inches in some pedons and typically contains about 50 to 80 percent rock fragments."

The soils formed in materials derived from mixed sedimentary rocks, mainly sandstone, shale, and argillite.  The climate is moist subhumid with mean annual air temperature of 40 to 45 degrees F, average summer temperature of 56 to 64 degrees F, and an average annual precipitation of 16 to 25 inches.  The freeze free period is 60 to 90 days."
