    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Depths given are measured from the mineral soil surface).  The A and Bt horizons are more than 40 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon is 20 inches or more thick.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and 35 to 50 percent clay.  The soil is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is more than 60 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It ranges from gravelly or cobbly clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay to gravelly or cobbly clay or to very gravelly or very cobbly clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the lower part. This horizon is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, loam and sandy clay loam and contains 50 to 70 percent rock fragments.  This horizon ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nA C horizon occurs below a depth of 50 inches in some pedons and typically contains about 50 to 80 percent rock fragments."

Arcia, Cristo and Sweitberg soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Arva soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and do not include hues of 2.5YR or 5YR. Broadhead soils contain less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon. Rugar soils are mottled in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Henefer soils are on fan remnants, toe slopes and mountain slopes at elevations of 5,200 to 8,400 feet.  Slopes are from 1 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in materials derived from mixed sedimentary rocks, mainly sandstone, shale, and argillite.  The climate is moist subhumid with mean annual air temperature of 40 to 45 degrees F, average summer temperature of 56 to 64 degrees F, and an average annual precipitation of 16 to 25 inches.  The freeze free period is 60 to 90 days."
