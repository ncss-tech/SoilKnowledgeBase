  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay, less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser, and 15 to 30 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 14 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and includes the upper part of the Bw horizon. The soil reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 10 to 15 percent gravel, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 15 to 25 percent soft rock fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles and 30 to 40 percent soft rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Huntley soils occur in open grassland areas on metastable broad ridgetops and side slopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Otter Point Formation.  Elevation is 1,000 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is about 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 120 to 210 days."

In addition Bravo and Cassiday soils have an ochric epipedon. Carpenterville soils occur in open grassland areas on broad ridgetops or side slopes of hills and mountains, are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and are clayey-skeletal.  Colepoint and Fritsland soils occur on broad ridgetops, benches, or side slopes of forested mountains, and are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Grouslous soils occur on steep side slopes of forested mountains, and are loamy-skeletal.  Houstenader soils occur in open grassland areas on broad ridgetops and side slopes of hills and mountains, are very deep, have an argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained."
