  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hippyjim soils are on depressions of plateaus.  They formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium derived from basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 25 to 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; negligible surface runoff; very slow permeability. Endosaturation is present with a seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 20 inches (very shallow or shallow internal free water occurrence classes) from December to May. During summer months in normal years the zone of saturation drops between 24 and 45 inches. Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils receive run-on moisture and are frequently ponded for very long duration (more than 45 days in normal years), mainly in the late winter and spring. They can be ponded for as long as 10 months in unusual years and periods of brief duration ponding can occur after intense rainfall events.  Depth of water during ponding is 10 to 20 inches."

Reference analyses for particle-size distribution, 15-bar water, cation exchange capacity, reaction, and total carbon are available.  The Btss and Bg horizons were also sampled for the soils laboratory at Oregon State University.
