  "OVERVIEW": "The Handpah series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Handpah soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
