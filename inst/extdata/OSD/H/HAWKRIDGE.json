Celeridge, Gabica, Gidwin, and Loope soils have lithic contacts at depths of 14 to 20 inches.  Genoa soils are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Gerdog soils have mean summer soil temperature of 62 to 66 degrees F.  Hutchley soils have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with 28 to 35 percent clay.  Melling soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.  Pernog soils are dominated by stones and have more than 27 percent clay in some part of the particle-size control section.  Rozara soils are dominated by fine gravel in the particle-size control section and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Shalcleav soils are dominated by channers and flagstones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hawkridge soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 10,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 50 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 14 inches (A1, A2, and Bt  horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 7 to 14 inches (Bt horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 14 inches to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 14 inches (A1, A2, and Bt horizons).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic Lithic Argicryolls.  Local soil temperature data indicates this soil has mean summer soil temperatures in the range of the frigid temperature regime.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
