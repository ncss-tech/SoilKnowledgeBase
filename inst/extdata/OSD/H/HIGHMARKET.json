The soils are formed in a loamy mantle, underlain by acidic, sandy or sandy-skeletal glacial till of Wisconsin age derived mainly from sandstone, shale, and siltstone. The till generally contains gravels, channers, flagstones, stones, and some boulders. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 1270 to 1727 mm and the mean annual temperature ranges from 1 to 11 degrees C. The mean annual frost-free days range from 90 to 140. Elevation ranges from 305 to 610 meters above sea level."

The Fishcreek (T) and Swancott (T) soils are sandy and sandy-skeletal, respectively, and derived from glacial outwash. Tughill soils are loamy-skeletal and very poorly drained."
