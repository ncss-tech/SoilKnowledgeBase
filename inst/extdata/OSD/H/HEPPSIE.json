  "OVERVIEW": "The Heppsie series consists of moderately deep, well drained\nsoils that formed in colluvium weathered from tuff, breccia and andesite.  They are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 35\nto 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches\nand the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
