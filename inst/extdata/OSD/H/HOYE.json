Abgese soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the Btk horizon. Ackley soils do not have Btk horizons and have nongravelly Bk horizons. Blacknest and Windypoint have lithologic discontinuities of sand and gravel at 50 to 100 cm. Greenbrae soils have lithologic discontinuities at 102 cm and are noncalcareous to 76 cm. Hardtrigger soils have 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonate in the Bk horizon. Harsan soils are deep over duripans. Hoosegow, Lankbush and Morfitt soils are noncalcareous to 100 cm or more. Shawave soils have rock fragments with granitic lithology and a mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 13 degrees C.

These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from intermediate and basic volcanic rocks. The climate is semiarid, and the average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual air temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C. The mean summer temperature is 20.5 to 22 degrees C, and the freeze-free period is 90 to 140 days."
