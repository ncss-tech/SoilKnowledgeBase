  "OVERVIEW": "The Hart Camp series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from tuff.  The Hart Camp soils are on rock pediment remnants, plateaus, mountains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
