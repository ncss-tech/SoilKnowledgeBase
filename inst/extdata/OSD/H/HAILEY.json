  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Rock fragments mainly consist of angular chert, but rounded chert and sandstone fragments may be present. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 50 to 80 inches.\nThe A horizon has color value of 2 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent.\nThe AB or E horizon (where present) has color value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 4. They are the very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues of silt loam or silt, and have 35 to about 80 percent chert fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is the very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly or extremely cobbly analogues of silt loam, loam or sandy loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is the gravelly to extremely gravelly, or very cobbly to extremely cobbly analogs of silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hailey soils are on steep side slopes and narrow ridgetops. These soils formed in locally transported colluvial materials and the underlying residuum weathered from cherty limestone mainly in the Elsey-Reeds Spring geologic formation. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Captina, Nixa, Noark, Rueter, and Tonti series. Captina, Nixa, and Tonti soils are on wide, nearly level to strongly sloping ridgetops and side slopes and have fragipans. Noark soils are on similar topographic positions as the Hailey soils, but Noark soils are clayey-skeletal in the series control section. Rueter soils have an argillic horizon within 40 inches and are on similar landscapes as Hailey."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Clarksville series in mapping. These soils were originally described to 60 inches, and classified as Typic Dystrochrepts. The typical pedon was described to 85 inches in 2002, and sampled for lab characterization. Lab data shows that the correct classification is a Typic Paleudalf.\nDiagnostic horizons and surface features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 11 inches (A and AB horizons);\ncambic horizon - the zone from about 11 inches to 62 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and Bw4 horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from 62 to 85 inches (2Bt horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: The University of Missouri soil characterization laboratory reference number for this pedon is M0200901.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
