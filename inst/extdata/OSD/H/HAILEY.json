  "OVERVIEW": "The Hailey series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils on steep side slopes and very narrow ridgetops. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from cherty limestone. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Clarksville series in mapping. These soils were originally described to 60 inches, and classified as Typic Dystrochrepts. The typical pedon was described to 85 inches in 2002, and sampled for lab characterization. Lab data shows that the correct classification is a Typic Paleudalf.\nDiagnostic horizons and surface features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 11 inches (A and AB horizons);\ncambic horizon - the zone from about 11 inches to 62 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and Bw4 horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from 62 to 85 inches (2Bt horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: The University of Missouri soil characterization laboratory reference number for this pedon is M0200901.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
