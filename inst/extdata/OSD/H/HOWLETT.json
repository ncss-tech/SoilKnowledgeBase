  "OVERVIEW": "The Howlett series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone.  Howlett soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
