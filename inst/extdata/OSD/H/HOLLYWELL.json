  "OVERVIEW": "The Hollywell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed extrusive igneous rocks.  Hollywell soils are on fan piedmonts and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
