(2 to 4 inches thick)\n3 to 15 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) dark-gray (4/1) moist; silt loam or light-textured clay loam; strongly calcareous; moderately to strongly developed coarse to medium granular; hard when dry, friable when moist; moderately permeable and high in water-holding capacity. (5 to 14 inches thick)\n15 to 35 inches; white (10YR 8/2) pale-brown (6/3 or 6/2.5) moist; loam; massive; breaks to subangular blocky fragments that are slightly hard when dry, friable when moist; this is moderately permeable and has a good water-holding capacity. (6 to 30 inches thick)\n35 to 72 inches; white (10YR 8/2), very pale-brown (7/3) moist; hardpan, probably of loam texture; hardpan is very hard when dry, hard when moist; massive or slightly  laminated in places; slowly to very slowly permeable; in places the hardpan is not so thick but is underlaid by stratified materials ranging from fine sandy loam to sandy clay loam; massive material that contains many lime carbonate nodules."

Where these soils are cropped in the Provo-Goshen area, small grains, sugar beets, and truck crops are grown, and moderately good yields are obtained.  Saltgrasses including both Sporobolus airoides and Disticulus spicata, with some sedges and other meadow grasses in the more moist areas."
