(2 to 4 inches thick)\n3 to 15 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) dark-gray (4/1) moist; silt loam or light-textured clay loam; strongly calcareous; moderately to strongly developed coarse to medium granular; hard when dry, friable when moist; moderately permeable and high in water-holding capacity. (5 to 14 inches thick)\n15 to 35 inches; white (10YR 8/2) pale-brown (6/3 or 6/2.5) moist; loam; massive; breaks to subangular blocky fragments that are slightly hard when dry, friable when moist; this is moderately permeable and has a good water-holding capacity. (6 to 30 inches thick)\n35 to 72 inches; white (10YR 8/2), very pale-brown (7/3) moist; hardpan, probably of loam texture; hardpan is very hard when dry, hard when moist; massive or slightly  laminated in places; slowly to very slowly permeable; in places the hardpan is not so thick but is underlaid by stratified materials ranging from fine sandy loam to sandy clay loam; massive material that contains many lime carbonate nodules."

Saltgrasses including both Sporobolus airoides and Disticulus spicata, with some sedges and other meadow grasses in the more moist areas."
