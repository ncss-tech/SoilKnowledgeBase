  "OVERVIEW": "The Hack series consists of verydeep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Hack soils are on alluvial fans, terraces and footslopes and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
