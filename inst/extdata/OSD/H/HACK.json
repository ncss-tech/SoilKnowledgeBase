Doyce, Pollynot, Timpanogos and Tirod soils have a calcic horizon.  Colockum and Lucero soils are similar to Hack.  Colockum soils have an argillic horizon that extends to 60 inches or more.  Lucero soils have a Bk horizon that is moderately to very strongly alkaline and pinyon pine is typically in the plant community."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium. The soils are in a semiarid climate having hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is about 31 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches. The frost free period is about 100 to 150 days."
