Cortaro soils have a higher soil temperature and a lower rainfall component.  In addition, Chimayo and Cortaro soils formed from gneiss and granite.  Telephone soils have a lower rainfall component and formed from sandstone and related sedimentary rocks."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolitic tuff.  The mean annual precipitation is 23 to 25 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."
