  "REVDATE": "10/2006",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hardin Heights series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils over limestone bedrock on small areas of limestone upland outcrops of the Hawthorn Formation in the Southern Coastal Plain of the Florida Panhandle.  They formed in loamy sediments that weathered from limestone bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.",

Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the A horizons and from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 3.  Content of limestone fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. Content of limestone fragments ranges from 5 to 30 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is composed of soft limestone that is easily dug with hand tools.  Hard limestone fragments range from 10 to 40 percent, by volume.\nThe R horizon is composed of limestone that is rippable by power equipment."
