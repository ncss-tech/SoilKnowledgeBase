Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the A horizons and from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 3.  Content of limestone fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. Content of limestone fragments ranges from 5 to 30 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is composed of soft limestone that is easily dug with hand tools.  Hard limestone fragments range from 10 to 40 percent, by volume.\nThe R horizon is composed of limestone that is rippable by power equipment."

Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  They formed in loamy sediments that weathered from limestone bedrock.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches and average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 66 degrees F."
