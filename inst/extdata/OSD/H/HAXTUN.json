  "STATES": "CO,KS,NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Haxtun series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in polylithologic parent materials consisting of sandy eolian sediment overlying an old buried soil surface.  Haxtun soils are on drainageways, slightly depressed areas on plains, or table lands and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) at the type location.",
