    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 50 inches and depth to soft shale bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.  The calcium magnesium ratio is less than 1.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Eroded pedons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon  has hue of 10R to 5YR, value 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles of chroma 2 or less are within the upper 8 to 15 inches of the Bt horizon.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 with common to many mottles in shades of gray, red, yellow, or brown; or it is mottled in shades of red, gray, brown, or yellow.\nThe Bt horizon is clay or silty clay with 20 to 45 percent silt and 45 to 70 percent clay.  Most pedons have a thin (1 to 5 inches thick) layer of clay loam or silty clay loam in the upper part.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6, mottles in shades of red, yellow, or brown; or it is mottled in varying shades of gray, red, yellow, and brown.  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has the same colors as the BC or CB horizon.  The soil material is massive or has granular or platy structure and has a texture range of sandy clay loam to clay with a clay content of 25 or 50 percent.  The C horizon has 40 to 90 percent by volume of clayey shale.\nThe Cr horizon constitutes a paralithic contact and is weathered shale."

Conecuh and Beatrice soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of more than 60 inches.  Arundel soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Beatric soils have vertic properties.  Luverne, Sacul, and Sweatman soils have mixed clay mineralogy."
