  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoven series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey alluvium in closed basins on uplands.  Permeability is very slow. Slopes are less than 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Some pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Few or common, faint or distinct mottles are in some pedons.  The E horizon commonly is silt loam but is silty clay loam in some pedons. It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btn and Btnk horizons have 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is clay or silty clay but is clay loam or silty clay loam in some pedons averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay.  The Btn horizon has weak to strong, medium or coarse columnar structure that parts to strong, medium or fine blocky and ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  The Btn2 and Btnk horizons have weak or moderate prismatic or subangular blocky structure that parts to moderate or strong blocky and they range from neutral to moderately alkaline. They have common to many nests and threads of gypsum in some pedons. Some pedons have Btnz horizons.\nThe Bk horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay. It has few to common fine or medium accumulations of carbonate and ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum and salts.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon and has colors of the Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; values of 3 to 5 moist and 4 to 7 dry; and chroma of 1 to 3.  The C horizon commonly is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The C horizon ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Most pedons have accumulations of gypsum and salts.  Below  a depth of 40 inches, some pedons are loamy fine sand or fine sand or have sandstone, siltstone, or shale bedrock."

None of these soils have a natric horizon. Agar, Beadle, Clarno, Glenham, Highmore, Houdek, Kadoka, Keith, Raber, Ree, and Richfield soils are well drained and are adjacent to the Hoven slopes on higher landscape positions.  Onita soils are in swales, do not have a natric horizon, and are better drained."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

These soils are saturated for 30 to 60 days or more to a depth of 3 feet or more in most years.  Permeability is very slow, but after dry periods initial water intake is moderate to rapid because of cracks in the solum.  Some pedons have a fluctuating water table commonly below depths of 5 feet.  The water table typically ranges from 1 foot above the surface to 1 1/2 feet below the surface."
