  "OVERVIEW": "The Hagensville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy till on end moraines, drumlins, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
