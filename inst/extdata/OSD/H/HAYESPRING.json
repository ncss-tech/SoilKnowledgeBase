    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hayespring soils are on lava plateaus. These soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,640 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 250 to 300 mm but may range as low as 230 mm and as high as 330 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
