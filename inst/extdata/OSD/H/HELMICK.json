  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 degrees 55 degrees F. Depth to sedimentary bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Thickness of the solum above the nonconforming 2BC or 2C horizon ranges from 12 to 28 inches. The particle-size control section averages 60 to 65 percent clay, 0 to 5 percent rock fragments and 0 to 10 percent pararock fragments. Redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less are within 30 inches of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent paragravel. Reaction is moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. The upper part is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay. The lower part is silty clay loam or silty clay with 30 to 45 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent paragravel. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2BC or 2C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay. It has 60 to 70 percent clay, 0 to 5 percent gravel, and 0 to 15 percent paragravel. The lower part of the 2C horizon has 0 to 35 percent paragravel. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Helmick soils are on low rolling hills that merge into the main valley terraces. Elevation is 250 to 400 feet. Slopes are 3 to 50 percent. The soils formed in silty glaciolacustrine deposits and colluvium over clayey residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone bedrock. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The average January temperature is 39 degrees F. and average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The frost-free season averages 165 to 210 days."

Bellpine, Hazelair, Steiwer and Willakenzie soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact and occur on more linear or convex parts of the hillslope. Dupee, Santiam and Suver soils have an argillic horizon with less than 60 percent clay and occur on fans or foot slopes."
