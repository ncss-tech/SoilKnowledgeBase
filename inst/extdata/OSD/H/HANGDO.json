  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is 11 to 15 inches.  Depth to visible carbonates is greater than 40 inches. The particle-size control section is 20 to 35 percent clay and averages 5 to 15 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments commonly increase in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 or 2 moist.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent pebbles and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 through 6.  It commonly is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam or cobbly loam with 20 to 35 percent clay in the upper part and cobbly sandy clay loam, very cobbly or very gravelly clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay in the lower part.  Rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon range from 10 to 40 percent pebbles, 10 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist, chroma of 4 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is cobbly sandy clay loam, very gravelly loam or very cobbly loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Daniels, Dooley, Empedrado, Fairfield, Farnuf, Felor, Lefor, Livona, Martinsdale, Reeder, Vida, Wemple, Williams and Yegen soils have accumulations of secondary carbonate above a depth of 40 inches.  Moen and Watrous soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Lininger soils have a paralithic contact at depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Trag soils are neutral or slightly acid throughout and have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  Trag soils also contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower subsoil.  Tschicoma soils have slightly acid to neutral Bt horizons and formed in volcanic rock."

The soils formed in eolian material overlying and mixed with alluvium derived from sandstone, shale and diorite.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches.  The freeze-free period is 80 to 100 days."
