  "OVERVIEW": "The Hurley series consists of moderately deep, moderately well and well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from clay shales on uplands.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 4 to 12 inches.  Depth to bedded shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Accumulations of salts are above or in the horizons with accumulations of carbonates and are at depths between 4 and 16 inches, and the SAR ranges from 10 to 20.  When the soil is dry, common cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend through the sola.  The dark gray color of the clay shale is evident throughout the soil.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist; and chroma is 1 or 2.  It typically is silt loam or silty clay loam but is silty clay in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 in the upper part and value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 in the lower part. The Bt horizon averages between 60 and 70 percent clay and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has moderate or strong, medium or fine columnar structure that parts to moderate medium and fine blocky or subangular blocky in the upper part.  Some pedons do not have accumulations of carbonate and salts in the lower part of the Bt horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay with as much as 35 percent fragments of shale by volume.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  It has accumulations of gypsum and other salts.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with color and texture of the Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon if it is present has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.  It is clay and contains 15 to 50 percent fragments of shale by volume.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have C2 horizons.\nThe Cr horizon ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."
