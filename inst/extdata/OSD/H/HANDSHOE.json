Competing series were also revised.\nThe 4/2005 revision changed the L horizon to an Oi and incorporated this horizon into the series control section.\nThe 7/2005 revision corrected minor grammatical errors.\nThe 2014 revision updates all text to semitabular format and converts most data to metric equivalents.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 16 inches (Oi, A & E horizons)\nCambic horizon--the zone from 16 to 68 inches (Bw and BC horizons)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--the zone from 10 to 30 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nCharacterization data is available from the KSSL for the following pedons:\nReference sample S94KY-119-6 (typical pedon).\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
