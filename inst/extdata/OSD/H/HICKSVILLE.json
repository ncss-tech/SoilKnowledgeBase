The mean annual soil temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F and the temperature remains above 47 degrees F throughout the year.  The soil is dry between 6 and 18 inches in most years from June 1 to October 15, moist in all parts from December 1 to May 1 and moist in some part the rest of the year.  Weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is 27 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  Texture is loam, gravelly loam or sandy clay loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  Content of gravel is 0 to 35 percent.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent in the upper 4 inches.  Some subhorizons are massive and hard or organic matter content decreases with depth to less than 1 percent at 9 inches.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon.  Color and reaction are similar to the A horizon.  Content of clay is 1 to 4 percent greater than the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3, 4/4; or 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4.  Bleached sand grains with dry color of 10YR 7/1, 7/2, or 6/5 occur on ped faces of lower subhorizons.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  Content of gravel is 5 to 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Base saturation (SUM) is 75 to 100 percent.\nThe BCt and 2Bt horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 or 7.5YR 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 4/4.  Bleached sand grains with dry color of 10YR 6/3, 7/1 or 7/2 occur on ped faces.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  Content of gravel is 5 to 15 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nA 2Bt horizon is present in most pedons that have gravelly textures throughout.  It is 5Y 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 6/2; or 10YR 6/3, 6/4 or 7.5YR 5/4.   Moist color is 2.5Y 5/4, 6/3; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/3 or 7.5YR 4/4.  Coarse textured layers have bleached sand grains with dry color of 10YR 6/3, 7/1, 7/2.  Texture is stratified loamy sand to clay loam.  Content of coarse fragments averages 35 to 60 percent but is 0 to 35 percent in some subhorizons.  Content of cobbles is 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline."

Perkins and Rescue soils have a Bt horizon with hues of 5YR and 2.5YR.  Sobrante soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Sodabay soils have 5YR hues throughout and are predominantly amorphous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hicksville soils are on low stream terraces and on alluvial flats along drainageways of terraces and hills at elevations of 30 to 230 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  The underlying consolidated sediments are also from mixed rock sources.  The climate is subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 to 61 degrees F; average January temperature is about 44 degrees F; and average July temperature is about 77 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 250 to 300 days."

Columbia soils have a coarse-loamy textural control section and are on low flood plains.  Corning soils have a fine textured control section and are on high terraces.  Hadselville soils are very shallow, have a mollic epipedon and are on hills.  Redding and San Joaquin soils have a duripan at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are on high terraces and low terraces respectively.  Pentz soils are shallow, have a mollic epipedon and are on hills."

The soils are flooded occasionally for very brief periods during high intensity storms in December through April.  A water table occurs in very deep pedons at depths of 60 to 72 inches for short periods in December through April. A perched water table occurs in deep pedons at a depth of 36 to 48 inches for short periods in December through April."
