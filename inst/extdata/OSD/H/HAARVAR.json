    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Haarvar soils are on rock pediment remnants, hills and low mountains.  These soils formed in residuum derived from tertiary sedimentary rock. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,140 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
