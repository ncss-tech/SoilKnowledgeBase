The soil between a depth of 8 inches and bedrock is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1 and is dry in all parts from July 15 through October 1 in most years.  There are 20 to 50 percent cobbles and 10 to 40 percent stones on the soil surface.  Base saturation (HACH) ranges from 70 to 95 percent throughout.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon is 2.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 5YR 4/3 or 4/4.  Moist color is 10R 3/4; 2.5YR 3/4 or 4/4.  It is very stony or extremely stony clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 27 to 35 percent.  Cobble content ranges from 15 to 45 percent and stone content ranges from 20 to 55 percent.  Total rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 80 percent."

The soils formed in material weathered from ultrabasic intrusive rocks.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 70 inches with occasional snowfall.  Mean January temperature is about 45 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 250 days."

Littlered soils are very deep.  Casabonne, Hollowtree and Holohan soils formed from sandstone that surrounds the ultrabasic rocks from which Hiltabidel soils were formed.  Casabonne soils are fine-loamy.  Hollowtree and Holohan soils have mixed mineralogy and are greater than 20 inches deep."
