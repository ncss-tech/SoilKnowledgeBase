Farland soils have a neutral or mildly alkaline Bt horizon and a solum less than 35 inches thick. Morton soils have soft shale bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. The Xavier soils have a solum less than 40 inches thick and an argillic horizon that has its base within 10 inches and is more than 35 percent clay."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hanaker soils are on terraces. Elevations are 3,500 to 4,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in glaciolacustrine deposits. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers. Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
