The soils formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 178 to 510 millimeters (7 to 20 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2,286 to 2,540 meters (90 to 100 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C (70 to 75 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
