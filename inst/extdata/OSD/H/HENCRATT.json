  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to the paralithic contact (tuff) is about 24 to 60 inches.  Gravels, cobbles and stones are throughout the profile and the control section usually contains about 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F. and mineralogy probably is ashy.  The soils are dry most years during the summer for more than 60 days in the 7 to 20 inch zone.\nThe A horizon colors are in 10YR hues and have values of 3 to 5 dry and 2 to 4 moist.  Chromas are 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Texture ranges from sandy loam to loam and is gravelly, cobbly or stony.  Structure is weak granular or weak subangular blocky, or the soils are massive. Consistence is soft, friable, or very friable, and nonsticky and nonplastic.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid and the thickness of the dark colored A horizons is less than 20 inches.\nThe B2 colors are in 10YR hues with values of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  Chromas are 3 or 4 moist or dry.  Texture ranges from heavy sandy loamy to heavy loams that are very stony, gravelly or cobbly. Structure is loose to moderate subangular blocky and consistence is hard or slightly hard, friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic. Reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Brief and Kilburn series in the same family and the Efwun and Surprise series in similar subgroups.  The Brief and Kilburn soils both lack a paralithic contact at depths shallower than 40 inches.  The Efwun soils lack a sambic horizon and are frigid.  The Surprise soils lack a paralithic contact and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hencratt soils occur in mountainous uplands with slopes that are mostly less than 30 percent but are as step as 50 percent or more in places.  Relief generally is smooth.  The regolith is gravelly, cobbly and stratified stony tuff that ranges in texture from fine grained to breccia.  Elevations range from about 4,500 feet to near 6,000 feet.  The climate is semi-arid with mean annual rainfall of 15 to 20 inches with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F., average January temperature about 26 degrees F., and average July temperature about 66 degrees F. Average frost free season is about 70 to 80 days."
