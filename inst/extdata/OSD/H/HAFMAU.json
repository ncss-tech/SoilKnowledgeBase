  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hafmau series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils on rolling mountain sideslopes and benches. They formed in mixed volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum from basalt or tuffs. Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
