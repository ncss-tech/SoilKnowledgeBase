  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is 20 to 50 inches and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 8 and 23 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1 and is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 15 in most years.  The particle-size control section is dominated by sandy loam textures.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 10 to 45 percent throughout.  Organic carbon content is 30 kg in upper cubic meter.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/2, or 3/3.  It is sandy loam but may be loamy sand in the lower part.  Clay content ranges from 6 to 12 percent and organic carbon content ranges from 2 to 5 percent.  Reaction is strongly through slightly acid.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4 or 5/6.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/4 or 4/6.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand or sand.  Clay content ranges from 4 to 10 percent.  Hard, subrounded nodules, 2 to 20mm, range from 0 to 15 percent. The horizon may be weakly cemented.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid."

The climate is characterized by cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 35 to 45 inches.  Mean January temperature is 49 degrees F., mean July temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 330 days."
