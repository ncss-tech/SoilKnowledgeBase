  "OVERVIEW": "The Hardbasin series consists of very shallow to a petrogypsic horizon, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from gypsiferous sedimentary rocks. Hardbasin soils are on summits of rock pediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
