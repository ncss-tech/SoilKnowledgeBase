Hoosan soils formed in clayey alluvium weathered from hard calcareous clayey shales, limestone, or calcareous sandstone.  The climate is cool with long cold winters and moist springs and summers.  Mean annual temperature is 30 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 30 inches.  The growing season is 50 to 70 days."
