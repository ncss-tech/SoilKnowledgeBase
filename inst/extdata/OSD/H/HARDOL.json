  "OVERVIEW": "The Hardol series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Hardol soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 640 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
