  "OVERVIEW": "The Houston series consists of moderately well drained, slowly permeable, cyclic soils that formed in alkaline clays and chalk of the Blackland Prairies.  These clayey soils have very high shrink-swell potential.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 4 to 9 feet.  The soil is clay throughout, ranging from 60 to 80 percent with 60 to 70 percent being most common.  Common or many intersecting slickensides are in the AC and C horizons.  These are cyclic soils, with cycles of microknolls and microbasins repeated at linear intervals of 6 to 12 feet.  The amplitude of waviness of the boundary between the A and AC horizon ranges from about 9 to 26 inches.  The A horizon ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.  Few, common,or many calcium carbonate concretions occur in the AC and C horizons.\nThe A11 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is (N 2/0) or (N 3/0).\nThe A12 horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2.  In some pedons it has value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 at depths more than 30 cm from the surface.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma 3 through 6.  Many pedons have C horizons mottled with shades of brown, yellow or gray.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Chalk bedrock is commonly light gray or pale yellow in color."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. Closely similar soils include the Brooksville, LaCerda, Louin, Naclina, Okolona, Redco, Terouge, and Vamont series.  All of these soils except LaCerda and Redco have less than 60 percent clay in their control section.  LaCerda and Redco soils have values of 4 or more within 30 cm of the surface and have mottles associated with wetness."

The climate is warm and humid.\nNear the type location the average annual temperature is 67 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 51 inches."

Binnsville and Demopolis soils have chalk within 20 inches of the surface.\nCatalpa soils have irregular distribution of organic matter and less than 60 percent clay in the control section.  Sumter soils have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and lack intersecting slickensides.  Vaiden soils are more acid and have distinct or prominent mottles within 20 inches of the surface."
