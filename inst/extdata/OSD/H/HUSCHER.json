    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe diagnostic horizons and characteristics recognized in this soil are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 26 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (Ap and A horizons)\nIrregular decrease of organic carbon: 52 centimeters (20 inches) Ab horizon\nThere has been discussion of whether these soils are well drained or moderately well drained, because redoximorphic concentrations can be found within 100 centimeters. These could be caused by irrigation or by the flooding occurring in the area.  The majority of these areas are irrigated and treated like well drained soils instead of moderately well drained soils.  It was decided to call them well drained because of that.\nThe series was set up to take the place of Cozad soils mapped on flood plains.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy: Eleventh edition, 2010\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData for typical pedon is from the Kansas State University Laboratory, Manhattan, Kansas; pedon: 01KS029005. Addition laboratory data- National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedon: 09KS157001.
