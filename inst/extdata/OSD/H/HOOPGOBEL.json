  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoopgobel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium over weakly consolidated ash, tuffaceous siltstone or tuffaceous sandstone.  These soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes on north-facing aspects.  Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 15 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Bachus, Benteen, Echemor, Senchert, Vadnais and Winu soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Brushtop soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact.  Odark soils are very deep. Squawval soils do not have a Btk horizon and have average annual soil temperature of 43 to 47 degrees F. Stubbs soils are in an ustic moisture regime. Squawval soils lack paragravels consisting of weakly consolidated ash.  Bavdark, Clayburn, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Hagenbarth, Millerlake, Pontuge, Southmount, and Thulepah soils are very deep.
