Bachus, Benteen, Echemor, Senchert, Vadnais and Winu soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Brushtop soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact.  Odark soils are very deep. Squawval soils do not have a Btk horizon and have average annual soil temperature of 43 to 47 degrees F. Stubbs soils are in an ustic moisture regime. Squawval soils lack paragravels consisting of weakly consolidated ash.  Bavdark, Clayburn, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Dehana, Demast, Dranburn, Hagenbarth, Millerlake, Pontuge, Southmount, and Thulepah soils are very deep.  Croydon and Dranyon soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."
