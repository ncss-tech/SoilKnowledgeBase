  "OVERVIEW": "The Holloron series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. These soils are on inset fans and stream terraces in intermountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
