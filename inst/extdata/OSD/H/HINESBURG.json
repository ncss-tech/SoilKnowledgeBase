  "OVERVIEW": "The Hinesburg series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy material that is underlain with silty lacustrine material.  They are level to very steep soils on lake plains and deltas.  Typically, Hinesburg soils have very dark grayish brown loamy fine sand A horizons, dark yellowish brown and olive brown loamy sand and loamy fine sand\nB horizons, and grayish brown silt loam IIC horizons.\nSOIL FAMILY:  Sandy over loamy, mixed, nonacid, mesic Typic Udorthents",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 32 inches.  Depth to bedrock exceeds 60 inches.  Depth to the C horizon ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 per- cent by volume throughout the soil.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to slightly acid in the solum and strongly acid to neutral in the C horizon.  Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 degrees to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y with value and chroma of 2 through 4.  A discontinuous E horizon is present in some pedons.  They are loamy sand to fine sandy loam.  They have weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure and friable or very friable consistence.\nThe B horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  They range from laomy fine sand to sand.  They are massive or single grain.  They have loose or very friable consistence.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4.  They range from loamy fine sand to sand.  They are massive or single grain.  The 2C horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  They range from very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam.  Thin strate of very fine sand to loamy fine sand are in some pedons.  They have weak to strong, thin to thick platy structure.  They have friable to firm or slightly plastic consistence."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  There are no other presently known series in the same family. Arkport, Eldridge, Melrose, Menominee, Metea, Oakville, Ocqueoc, Spinks and Windsor series are similar soils in related families.  Arkport soils have a higher content of silt and very fine sand in the upper part of the control section and have an argillic horizon.  Eldridge soils have mottles in the solum.  Melrose soils are loamy over clayey.  Menominee and Ocqueoc soils have spodic and argillic horizons and a frigid soil temperature regime.  Metea soils have an argillic horizon.  Oakville and Windsor soils lack the loamy 2C horizon.  Spinks soils have an argillic horizon in the form of lamellae."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in sandy material that is underlain with loamy material at less than 40 inches.  The climate is humid continental with cool summers and cold winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches.  The growing season ranges from 130 to 180 days."

The moderately well drained Eldridge and poorly drained Enosburg soils are in a drainage sequence with Hinesburg soils.  Belgrade, Birdsall, Hartland, and Raynham soils developed in silty lacustrine material.  Deerfield soils developed in sands more than 40 inches thick.  Munson soils are course silty over clayey, and Scantic soils have a fine particle-size control section."
