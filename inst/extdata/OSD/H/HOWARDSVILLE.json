  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Howardsville series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from rhyolite, tuff, and similar volcanic rocks.  Howardsville soils are on fan remnants and river terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",
