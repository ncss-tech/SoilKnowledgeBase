  "OVERVIEW": "The Hanks series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from granitic and related rocks. Hanks soils are on sideslopes, saddles, benches, and ridge crests and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid. The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
