Slopes range from about 5 to 65 percent. Most aspects are northerly. The soils are forming in residuum and possibly colluvium derived from granitic and related rocks. The average annual precipitation is 35 to 45 inches and includes 140 to 180 inches of snowfall. The average frost-free period is 20 to 60 days."
