  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)\nCambic horizon - from 3 to 50 inches (Bw horizon); based on the color change from the horizon above and the lack of fine stratification (This horizon was originally described as a non-cambic C horizon).\nOxyaquic feature - the lower part of the Bw horizon is assumed to be saturated for more that 20 days, based on the described redox features and the depth to water table (2 to 5 feet). This range in water table depth crosses a taxonomic limit; soils with a high water table depth below 40 inches would not be in the Oxyaquic subgroup, hence would no longer be considered within the series range.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of Bw horizon)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\n1.1  Organic matter content of .5 to 1 percent is by field estimate.\n1.2  Clay content of 20 to 35 percent is by field estimate and includes carbonatic clay.\nOther Diagnostic Properties:\n1.  Carbonatic mineralogy is determined by field kit.\n2.  The precipitation and temperatures are interpolated from data for stations at Mountain View and Evanston and from vegetation.\nNote from 02/2007 revision: The actual noncarbonate clay content in the particle-size control section is unclear. The RIC notes describes it as \" 20 to 35 percent noncarbonatic clay\" but note 1.2 above suggests this clay range includes carbonate clay. It seems very likely that the note is correct and the 20 to 35 percent range is for total clay, which is consistent with the clay loam or sandy clay loam textures described. When this total clay range is discounted for carbonate clay, a reasonable range in noncarbonate clay would be about 12 to 18 percent. This needs to be confirmed, as this would place the soil in a coarse-loamy class.\nThe 03/2007 revision changes the classification from Aquic Eutrocryepts to Oxyaquic Haplocryepts. The classification when established was fine-loamy, carbonatic Aquic Cryorthents.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
