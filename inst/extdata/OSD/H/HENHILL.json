  "OVERVIEW": "The Henhill series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lake sediments and alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  They are on stream terraces adjacent to rivers or creeks.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
