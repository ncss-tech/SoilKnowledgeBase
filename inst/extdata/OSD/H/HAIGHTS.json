  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments dominated by shale range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the upper part of the solum and from 20 to 60 percent in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon, and include up to 10 percent greater than 3 inches with average rock fragment content in the particle-size control section less than 35 percent.  The soil ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid in the solum, and from strongly acid through slightly acid in the substratum.  Some pedons are neutral below 48 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, medium or fine graular.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  High or low chroma mottles may occur below a depth of 24 inches.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate very fine to medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction with thin lenses of gravelly sand and pockets of fine sand in the lower part.  It is massive or has weak or moderate, medium or thick platy structure. Consistence is friable or very friable."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mesaba and Mosinee and the tentative Bice, Elliottsville, Millsite and Wawina soils in the same family.  Mesaba soils formed in glacial till and have gabbro bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Mosinee soils\nformed in thin loamy deposits and in the underlying deeply weathered granitic rock.  Bice soils formed in deep till and lack stratification in the C horizon.  Elliottsville and Millsite soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Wawina soils have very fine sand or loamy very fine sand textures throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in alluvium or outwash material from shale and some sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 43 inches, mean annual temperature from 40 to 44 degrees F., and mean annual growing season from 90 to 130 days."
