    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The histic epipedon ranges from 8 to 14 inches in thickness and includes part of the A horizon in some pedons.  The depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue ranging from 10YR through 2.5Y, value moist from 2 through 6 and chroma moist from 0 through 3.  Texture is dominantly silt loam, but ranges to include very fine sandy loam and loam.  Mottles are present in some pedons.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nA Bw horizon is present in some pedons and has a hue of 10YR through 5YR, value from 2 to 4 and chroma from 1 to 4.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 10 to 30 percent, with 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble.  Texture is commonly silt loam or sandy loam.  Mottles are present ion some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue from 5YR through 2.5Y, value moist from 2 through 5, and chroma moist from 0 through 4.  The hue of the mottles ranges from 2.5YR through 5Y, value moist from 2 through 7, and chroma moist from 1 to 8.  Texture is commonly silt loam, but ranges to include fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and very fine sandy loam.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 35 percent."

Helm soils are formed in residuum and colluvium from phyllite, schist, sedimentary or granitic bedrocks.  They are underlain by bedrock within 20 inches.  The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation of 120 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 120 percent."
