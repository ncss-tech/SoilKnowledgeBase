  "OVERVIEW": "The Hapur series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that\nformed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Hapur soils are on channeled\nbottomlands and floodplains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.\nPermeability is moderately slow in the upper horizons and very rapid in\nthe lower horizons.  The average annual precipitation is about 14\ninches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
