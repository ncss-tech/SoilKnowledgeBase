    "content": "REMARKS: Hooksan soils were previously mapped as Fripp, Udipsamments, Coastal Beach, or Dune land. The Hooksan series was previously classified as siliceous, uncoated Typic Udipsamments.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 6 inches (A horizon)\nThe 9/2011 revision adds Rhode Island to the states using the series and adds saturated hydraulic conductivity class.\nThe 2/2017 revision removes Hammonton and Klej as geographically associated and adds Matunuck, Pawcatuck, Sandyhook, and Succotash.  Hammonton and Klej are on the mainland and not associated with barrier island and dune systems.  Connecticut and Maine added to the states using the series.\nSoil Interpretation Record: NJ0075, NJ0211\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nFull characterization data for pedons with User Pedon IDs of 93MD047016, 99NJ025001, S1997NY081006, S2013MA001001, S2013MA001002, S2013MA023001.
