    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Central Point, Dehill, Edmundston, Imbler, Oak Glen, Ritter, and Vernado soils. The Central Point (MLRA 5) soils do not have a Bt horizon, formed in alluvium weathered from granitic and metamorphic rocks and have 0 to 3 percent slopes. The Dehill soils formed in alluvium material weathered from extrusive igneous rocks and are on alluvial fans. Edmundston soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Imbler soils formed in eolian mixed materials and do not have a Bt horizon. Oak Glen soils have hues redder than 10YR in the C horizon. Ritter (MLRA 10) soils have a cambic horizon and are stratified. Vernado (MLRA 15) soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact."

Elevations are 704 to 1,794 meters (2,305 to 5,885 feet). The climate consists of warm dry summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 203 to 356 centimeters (8 to 14 inches). The mean annual temperature is 14 to 18 degrees C. (57 to 64 degrees F.). The frost free season is 150 to 250 days."
