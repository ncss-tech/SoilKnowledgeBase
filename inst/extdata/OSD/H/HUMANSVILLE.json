  "OVERVIEW": "The Humansville series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in silty and clayey alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to depressional areas in floodplains and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",

Lanton soils are thermic.\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of Missouri soil characterization laboratory number M9116718. Pedon site ID number is 91MO167132.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
