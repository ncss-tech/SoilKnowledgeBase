  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum  ranges from 38 to 102 cm (15 to 40 in). Depth to carbonates ranges from 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 in). Depth to densic material is 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in). Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm (60 in). Rock fragments range 5 to 35 percent by volume in the solum, and from 5 to 50 percent in the substratum. Rock fragments are mainly gravel with some cobbles and stones. Some pedons have C horizons with dominant chroma of 2 above 51 cm (20 in), but the soil is not saturated for significant periods during the growing season; thus this color is due to a lithochromic effect. Values for exchangeable magnesium range from 15 to 100 percent of the values for exchangeable calcium in the B and the C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues, in the fine-earth fraction. The horizon has fine or medium granular structure and friable or very friable consistence. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. In undisturbed areas, pedons have an A horizon up to 13 cm (5 in) thick, with a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues, in the fine-earth fraction. It has very weak to moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure and is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with fine subangular blocky structure or platy structure, or it is massive.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam,  sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. The horizon is massive or has plate-like divisions. Consistence is mainly firm or very firm. Some pedons have a C horizon that is friable and up to 51 cm (20 in) thick above the Cd. The Cd or C horizon is calcareous, but expression of effervescence is occasionally slow in some pedons with cold dilute acid which is not uncommon for finely divided dolomite. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. The Amenia, Bombay, Eelweir, Georgia, Grenville, and Kalurah soils are similar soils in related families. Amenia, Bombay, and Georgia soils have a mesic temperature regime; in addition, Amenia soils have a lower content of magnesium and a high content of calcite, Bombay soils have an argillic horizon, and Georgia soils lack free carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 in). Eelweir and Kalurah soils lack carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 in). In addition, Eelweir soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the subsoil and substratum. Grenville soils lack 2 chroma redoximorphic depletions within a depth of 61 cm (24 in)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hogansburg soils are nearly level to moderately steep and are on  low hills and ridges on till plains. The till has a high component of dolomitic limestone with varying amounts of calcitic limestone, sandstone, schist and granitic materials. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1490 mm (31 to 59 in), and mean annual frost-free days ranges from  100 to 160 days. Elevation range from 28 to 486 m (90 to 1600 ft) above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Grenville, Kalurah, Malone, Nehasne, Runeberg, and Waddington soils on nearby landscapes. Grenville, Malone, and Runeberg soils are in a drainage sequence with Hogansburg soils. The well drained Grenville soils are on high convex ridges and knolls,  the somewhat poorly drained Malone soils are on foot slopes and in nearly  level areas, and poorly or very poorly drained Runeberg soils are on depressions between hills and ridges. Kalurah soils are in nearby areas where the soil is slightly more acid. Nehasne soils are in areas where bedrock is at depths less than 102 cm (40 in). Waddington soils are on nearby terraces and formed in stratified sand and gravel deposits."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the  surface and upper subsoil, moderately low to high in the lower subsoil and friable substratum, and low to moderately high in the dense substratum."
