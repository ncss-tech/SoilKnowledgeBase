  "OVERVIEW": "The Hambrick series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks, dominantly shale and sandstone.  Hambrick soils are on flood-plain steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.",
