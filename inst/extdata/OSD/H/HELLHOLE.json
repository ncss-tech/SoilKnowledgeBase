  "OVERVIEW": "The Hellhole series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in mossy organic material. The Hellhole soils are on fens on mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1165 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
