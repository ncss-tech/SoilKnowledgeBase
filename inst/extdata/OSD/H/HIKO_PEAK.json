    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hiko Peak soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and hills. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from basic igneous rocks, limestone, quartzite, sandstone and conglomerate. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Elevations range from 1,341 to 2,286 meters. The climate is semiarid and the mean annual precipitation is 200 to 350 mm. June is usually the driest month.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10.5 degrees C and the mean summer temperature is about 18 to 20.5 degrees C. The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
