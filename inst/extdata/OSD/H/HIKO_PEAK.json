  "OVERVIEW": "The Hiko Peak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from basic igneous rocks, limestone, and quartzite. Hiko Peak soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and hills. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
