  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 27 inches and at some sites the fragipan is underlain by weathered sandstone.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout, but is higher in the upper horizons where limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. Rock fragments are 0 to 10 percent.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or clay loam. Rock fragments are 0 to 10 percent.\nThe 2Ex and 2Btx horizons have hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam or their gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues. Rock fragments are 0 to 70 percent.\nThe 3Bt horizon is multicolored.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, clay, or their gravelly, cobbly, very gravelly, or very cobbly analogues. Rock fragments are 0 to 50 percent.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon that is similar in color and texture to the 3Bt horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hoberg and Viraton series. Hoberg soils have a surface horizon that meets the requirements for mollisols except for thickness or base saturation. Viraton soils have less than 20 percent sand in the series control section and do not have the sandstone coarse fragments common to the Hobson series."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hobson soils typically are on gently sloping ridgetops and upper side slopes. Some areas are on structural benchs. Slopes are dominantly 3 to 6 percent with extreme ranges of 2 to 14 percent.  They formed in residuum from mixed sandstone and cherty limestone or cherty dolomite. There is sometimes a thin silty mantle of loess, ranging in maximum thickness to about 10 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 48 inches."

Clarksville, Coulstone, and Nixa soils contain more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Lebanon and Plato soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Clarksville and Coulstone soils commonly are on steeper slopes.  Lebanon and Nixa soils are on similar landscapes.  Plato soils are at higher elevations and more gentle slopes."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The series type location is moved to Webster County because the fragipan and underlying residuum is more typical in chert fragment content and texture.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (A, E and BE horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 10 inches to 60 inches or more (Bt, 2Btx1, 2Btx2 and 3Bt horizons).\nfragipan - the depth from approximately 21 to 40 inches (2Btx1 and 2Btx2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
