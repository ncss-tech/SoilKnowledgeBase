  "OVERVIEW": "The Haverhill series consists of moderately deep, very poorly drained soils formed in shale residuum with limestone fragments over shale.  These soils are on foot slopes, side slopes of low ridges and benches within uplands.  They have slow permeability in solum and very slow permeability in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 35 inches.  Free carbonates typically are in all parts of the solum and the calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction ranges from 2 to 8 percent.  A few pedons lack free carbonates in the upper few inches.  The content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon and 0 to 35 percent in the B horizon.  The fragments are gravelly, channery, or flaggy limestone.  These soils are saturated most of the time because of seepage, even through extended dry periods. Some pedons have an 0 horizon as much as 6 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or is N 2/0 or N 3/0.  It typically is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay but includes mucky silty clay loam.  It has subhorizons of sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in a few pedons.  It typically is mildly alkaline, but it is neutral in the upper part in a few pedons.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5Y through 5G, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has few through many mottles.  It typically has a fine-earth fraction of clay or silty clay, but it has coarser textured subhorizons in a few pedons.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 5Y through 5G, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or is N 5/0 or N 6/0.  It is clay or silty clay.  It has thin strata of limestone below depths of 60 inches in a few pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils typically have plane or concave slopes, but a few have slightly convex slopes.  Their gradient ranges from 1 to 12 percent.  They primarily are on foot slopes and side slopes of low ridges and benches in dissected uplands.  They formed primarily in shale residuum and they commonly have a significant amount of limestone fragments.  This material overlies shale bedrock.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 5l degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 35 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brodale, Lacrescent, Shullsburg, and Sogn soils.  Brodale and Lacrescent soils formed mostly in loamy skeletal colluvium from limestone and are typically on steeper areas downslope or upslope from Haverhill soils.  Shullsburg soils formed mostly from shale and are not as wet as Haverhill soils.  Sogn soils which are underlain by limestone at shallower depths are mostly upslope."

Competing series and other updates will be made later. 2/14/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected."
