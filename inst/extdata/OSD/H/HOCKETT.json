  "OVERVIEW": "The Hockett series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and till over residuum derived from granitic rocks. The Hockett soils are on structural benches in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 720 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
