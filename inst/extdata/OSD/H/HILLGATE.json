The soil between the depths of 6 and 18 inches is dry in all parts from May 15 to October 31 and moist in some or all parts from November 1 to May 15. Weighted average clay content for the 19 to 39 inch textural control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay.

Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or clay loam. Reaction is strongly to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/6, 6/3, 5/8, 5/6, 5/4, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/8, 5/6, 5/5, 5/4, 4/6 and moist color of 10YR 5/6, 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, 3/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 4/6, 4/4, 4/3, 3/4.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cometa, Corning, Hytop, Millsap, Orognen, San Ysidro and Yokayo series. Cometa has a solumn thickness of 24 to 40 inches and the Bt includes 5YR colors. The Corning series has Bt colors of 2.5YR or 5YR. The Hytop series has a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Millsap has a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Orognen has 5YR Bt colors. Yokayo has a solumn thickness of 30 to 50 inches, mean annual air temperature of 57 degrees F. and precipitation of 32 to 44 inches.\nHillgate needs to be competed with San Ysidro during MLRA update.  The soils are the same, but Hillgate is mapped on slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  The San Ysidro is mapped on 0 to 9 percent slopes and may need to be combined with Hillgate on 0 to 9 percent slopes.  Colusa County holds the Hillgate type location which was lab sampled.  In Colusa the Hillgate is mapped on 0 to 9 percent slopes.  The Hillgate on 9 to 50 percent slopes (in Eastern Santa Clara County) would then be a new series."

The climate is semiarid to subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation varies from 14 to 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 65 degrees F. Average January temperature is about 44 degrees and the average July temperature is about 80 degrees F. Average frost free season is about 185 to 300 days."
