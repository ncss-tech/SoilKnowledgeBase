  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils have ochric epipedons (massive and hard dry; high values; less than 1% organic matter), cambic horizon and lithic contact at depths of 20 inches or less.  The soils are usually moist but dry for 60 consecutive days in most years.\nThe mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 72 degrees F. Mineralogy is mixed.  Depth to sandstone is 4 to 20 inches.  Banding of colors in the profiles appears to be a reflection of banding in the parent material.  In places a conglomerate may underlie the soil.  The A horizon ranges in color from very pale brown, strong brown to light reddish brown; in texture from fine sandy loam to sandy loam and may be gravelly; in reaction from strongly acid to very strongly acid.  The A horizon is massive and slightly hard dry. The B horizon ranges in color from very pale brown, olive brown, olive yellow to reddish yellow; in texture from sandy loam to fine sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to very strongly acid.  The sandstone is moderately to strongly consolidated and becomes harder with increasing depth.  Reaction is strongly to very strongly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family. Similar soils in another order are Cieneba, Pentz, Trigo Amador and Whiterock.  These soils lack cambic horizons.  The Amador soils overlie rhyolitic tuff at depths of less than 20 inches.  The Whiterock soils overlie slate at depths less than 20 inches.  Pentz soils overlie andesitic tuff.  Trigo soils overlie softly consolidated granitic alluvium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Hornitos soils occur on gently rolling to steep topography underlain by softly to moderately consolidated sandstone of the Ione formation.  They occur at elevations below 900 feet, in a semiarid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 12 to 18 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., average January temperature about 45 degrees F. and average July temperature about 81 degrees F.  Frost-free season averages about 240 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification of the soils in the Merced, Madera, Mariposa, and Eastern Stanislaus Areas appears as follows:  The soils in Merced Area, Madera and Mariposa Areas have a cambic horizon and are Dystric Lithic Xerochrepts.  The soils in the Eastern Stanislaus Area lack cambic horizons and range in reaction from slightly to strongly acid. The type location is in a nonacid family.  These soils are Lithic Xerorthents, loamy, mixed, nonacid, thermic family.  The soils were formerly classified in the Lithosol group.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.
