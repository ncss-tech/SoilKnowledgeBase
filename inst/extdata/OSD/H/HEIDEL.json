A few fragments of ironstone or chert gravel or both, which make up less than 10 percent of the volume, are in some pedons.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon has 20 to 50 percent silt.  Most pedons contain pockets of uncoated sand grains that make up as much as 5 to 10 percent of the volume.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  Some pedons have sandy clay loam in the lower part of the Bt horizon.\nThe BC or C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam with thin lamellae in shades of red."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The McLaurin series is the only known series in the same family.  Closely related series include the Benndale, Butters and Niwana series.  McLaurin soils are on similar positions but have a bisequum.  Benndale soils are on similar to lower positions and have yellower subsoils.  Butters soils have yellower subsoils and less than 20 percent silt in the control section.  Niwana soils have an ochric epipedon in which the combined thickness of the A and E horizons is more than 20 inches and are in the Western Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152B)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in marine deposits, consisting of thick beds of loamy sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees Fahrenheit, and the mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches near the type location."

The excessively drained Alaga soils are sandy throughout. Bama and Ruston soils are on similar, less sloping areas and have fine-loamy control sections. In addition, Ruston soils are bisequal Lucy soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Smithdale soils are on similar positions, have fine-loamy subsoils and have a clay decrease before a 60-inch depth.  Sweatman soils are on lower positions on hill sides and have clayey control sections. The somewhat excessively drained Troup soils are in slightly higher positions and more dissected slopes and have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 40 to 80 inches thick."
