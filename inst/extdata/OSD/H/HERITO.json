Bapos soils have a mollic intergrade epipedon, very slow permeability and an abrupt A/B boundary with an increase of 15 percent clay or more.  Cometa, Corning, and Orognen soils have mixed clay mineralogy and an abrupt boundary with an increase of 15 percent clay or more. Dibble soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Los Banos soils have mixed clay mineralogy and the clay content drops more than 20 percent from the maximum of the argillic horizon within 1.5 m.  Millsap soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Ryer and Stomar soils have clay contact that drops more than 20 percent from the maximum of the argillic horizon within 1.5 m and they do not have chromas of 6 or more in the argillic horizon.  Yokayo soils have mixed clay mineralogy and receive 32 to 44 inches of precipitation."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were mapped as Pleasanton, Rincon, and the now inactive Herdlyn series.  They are being differentiated from the Pleasanton series by not having a fine-loamy texture control section, and from the Rincon series by having chromas of 6 or more in the argillic horizon and having less than a 20 percent drop in clay content below the argillic horizon.  Reaction determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellig-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HC1 solution.  Organic matter assumed to be less than 1 percent based on Walkley-Black digestion method tests on adjacent soils."
