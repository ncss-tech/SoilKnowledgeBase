Depth to secondary carbonates range from 40 to 65 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  The boundary from the A to the Btn horizon is abrupt or clear.\nThe Btn1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have redoximorphic concentrations in shades of brown.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  The exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 15 to 25.  Most pedons have brownish or grayish silt coatings on faces of peds.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btn2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Soils in similar families are the Carytown, Doolin, Drummon, Foard, Hinkle, Huska, Oscar, Pawhuska, Santanela, Seminole, Wakita, and Wing series.  Carytown soils have more than 15 percent sodium saturation deeper than 6 inches of the upper boundary of the natric horizon, and the depth to the natric horizon is more than 16 inches from the soils surface.  Doolin, Foard, and Seminole soils have mollic epipedons and are dry for longer periods.  In addition, Doolin and Foard soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Drummon, Hinkle, Huska, Pawhuska, and Wing soils do not have an aquic moisture regime and do not have dominant chroma of 2 or less in coatings on the surface of peds and mottles within the argillic horizon.  In addition, Hinkle soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Oscar and Wakita soils have fine-silty control sections and are dry for longer periods.  Santanela soils have fine-loamy control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in silty alluvium of Recent age or Quaternary age.  Climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 48 to 64.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1200 feet."

These soils have a perched water table that ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 feet of the soils surface for short periods of time during November to April.  These soils are subject to flooding during March to October."
