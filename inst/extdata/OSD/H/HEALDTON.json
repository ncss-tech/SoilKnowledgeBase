  "OVERVIEW": "The Healdton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in silty alluvium of Recent age or Quaternary age.  These soils are on nearly level flood plains in the Grand Prairie.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 35 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",

Soils in similar families are the Carytown, Doolin, Drummon, Foard, Hinkle, Huska, Oscar, Pawhuska, Santanela, Seminole, Wakita, and Wing series.  Carytown soils have more than 15 percent sodium saturation deeper than 6 inches of the upper boundary of the natric horizon, and the depth to the natric horizon is more than 16 inches from the soils surface.  Doolin, Foard, and Seminole soils have mollic epipedons and are dry for longer periods.  In addition, Doolin and Foard soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Drummon, Hinkle, Huska, Pawhuska, and Wing soils do not have an aquic moisture regime and do not have dominant chroma of 2 or less in coatings on the surface of peds and mottles within the argillic horizon.  In addition, Hinkle soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Oscar and Wakita soils have fine-silty control sections and are dry for longer periods.  Santanela soils have fine-loamy control sections."
