  "OVERVIEW": "The Harlake series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified clayey calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
