  "OVERVIEW": "The Hallsummit series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in thick loamy and clayey sediments on Tertiary-aged Coastal Plains. These soils are on broad sloping interfluves. Slope is dominantly 1 to 8 but ranges up to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,318 mm (52 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
