  "OVERVIEW": "The Haypeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from limestone and dolomitic limestone. The Haypeak soils are on backslopes and shoulders of mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 375 millimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C. (45 degrees F.)",
