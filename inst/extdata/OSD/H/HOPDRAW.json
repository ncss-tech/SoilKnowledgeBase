Coarse fragments ranging in size from pebbles to 12 inch cobbles and fragstones  cover up to 25 percent the surface and are throughout the A and C horizons.  The rock fragments make up 35 to 75 percent by volume of the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is gravelly or very gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly and flaggy or very flaggy loamy fine sand and fine sand. It contains 15 to 60 percent by volume of fragments of rock.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is very gravelly, very cobbly, and very flaggy loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.  It contains 35 to 75 percent fragments by volume.  It is slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe R horizon is hard or extremely hard sandstone that has some cracks and fractures.  It is neutral to strongly alkaline."

In addition, Oraid soils have hard bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Quamon soils have dominantly coarse fragments of basalt and have a drier climate.  Tinsley soils have coarse fragments other than sandstone and have a drier climate."

These soils formed in residuum and local colluvial sediments weathered from sandstone.  They typically are on south or west aspects.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 26 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F."

Lakoa soils have a fine-loamy control section and Vanocker soils are loamy-skeletal and both have an argillic horizon.  The Sawdust soils have a loamy-skeletal control section and are on similar landscape position of the Hopdraw soils."
