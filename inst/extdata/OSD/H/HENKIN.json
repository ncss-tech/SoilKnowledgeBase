  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches and it extends into the Bw horizon.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 18 to 60 inches and typically is about 21 to 28 inches.  The control section is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with less than 18 percent clay.  In some pedons, the solum is directly on sand at depths below 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam and ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, but some pedons are loam.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  Some pedons have thin layers of loamy fine sand or loamy sand. It has few or common, fine or medium concretions and accumulations of carbonates.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is stratified loamy and sandy material as fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, and clay loam.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  A 2C horizon is present in some pedons between depths of 40 and 60 inches that is clay loam or loam glacial till, or sand and gravel."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Henkin soils are nearly level to gently rolling on uplands with convex surfaces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 9 percent.  They formed in sandy and loamy glacial meltwater deposits. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 18 to 26 inches."

Blendon soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick and are on lower parts of the landscape. Dempster and Enet soils have sand and gravel at depths between 20 and 40 inches and are on similar landscapes.  Egan and Wentworth soils are fine-silty and are on slightly lower parts of the landscape.  Flandreau and Hand soils are on similar to slightly lower landscapes and have a fine-loamy control section.  Grovena soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section, and are on lower parts of the landscape."
