    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Henningsen soils are on flood plains.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks but with a strong influence from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,450 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Job, Kazul, and Whitmire soils and the competing Morwen soil.  Job soils are fine-loamy, have ochric epipedons, and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.  Kazul soils are fine-loamy, have cambic horizons, and have strongly contrasting sandy-skeletal material at depths of 100 to 127 cm from the soil surface.  Whitmire soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have thick mollic epipedons, and have aquic conditions within 76 cm of the soil surface."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 76 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Henningsen soils are used for irrigated pasture, hayland, rangeland, and urban development.  Irrigated crops are alfalfa and legume-grasses mixtures.  Vegetation in rangeland is willows, cottonwood, sedges, and Juncus sp.  These soils are also a source of gravel (aggregate) for concrete manufacture."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The revision of 5/2000 changed the particle-size class from sandy-skeletal to coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and updated the taxonomic subgroup from Aquic Haploxerolls to Oxyaquic Haploxerolls.  The Henningsen soil mapped in Garfield County, Washington needs correlation to another series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (Ap and A horizons).\nMajor lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to sandy-skeletal material with the boundary at 33 cm (between the A and 2C1 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of endosaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between 76 and 152 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the 2C2 horizon).\nParticle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (2C1 horizon and parts of the A and 2C2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
