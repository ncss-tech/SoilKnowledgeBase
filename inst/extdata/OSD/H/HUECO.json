Slopes are mostly less than 3 percent.  The regolith consists of very thick sandy to loamy bolson sediments many hundred feet deep.  The climate is arid with average annual rainfall of 6 to 12 inches and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices of 10 to 16.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 degrees to 68 degrees F. Elevation is 3,900 to 4,200 feet."
