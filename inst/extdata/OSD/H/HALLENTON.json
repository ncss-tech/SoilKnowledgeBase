  "OVERVIEW": "The Hallenton series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and glacialmarine drift.  Hallenton soils are in ponded areas on glacialmarine drift plains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils formed in loess, volcanic ash, and glacialmarine drift.  Hallenton soils have a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F, mean July temperature is 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."
