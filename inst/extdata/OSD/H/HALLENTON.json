    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hallenton soils are ponded depressions on glacialmarine drift plains at elevations of 200 to 300 feet.  These soils formed in loess, volcanic ash, and glacialmarine drift.  Hallenton soils have a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F, mean July temperature is 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS;  These are the Labounty and Whatcom soils.  Labounty soils have an umbric epipedon.  Whatcom soils have a spodic horizon and are moderately well drained."
