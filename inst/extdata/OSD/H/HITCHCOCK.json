  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Rock fragments are less than 5 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout, unless limed.  Matrix chroma of 2 is inherited from the parent material and is not indicative of aquic conditions.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Udisturbed pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is similar to the Bw horizon.  Structure is similar to the Bw horizon or it is massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The C horizon is massive or has weak or moderate, medium to very thick plates.  Texture of the C horizon is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silt.  Thin or very thin strata of loamy very fine sand, silty clay loam, or silty clay  can be present in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Poocham and Unadilla series. Poocham soils have thinner sola and are on slopes of 25 percent or greater. Unadilla soils have moderately rapid or rapid permeability below a depth of 40 inches. Bridgehampton soils may be in the same family when classified to the 8th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nBridgehampton soils formed in outwash material and have thicker sola.\nThe Belgrade, Charlton, Chatfield, Dutchess, Enfield, Hartland, Melrose, and Scio series are in related families.  Belgrade and Scio soils have redox depletions of chroma 2 or less within a depth of 24 inches.  Charlton, Chatfield and Dutchess soils are coarse-loamy.  Enfield soils are coarse-silty over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Hartland soils have base saturation of 60 percent or more.  Melrose soils are underlain by clay below a depth of 18 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The growing season ranges from 110 to 180 days."

The Agawam, Enfield, Haven, Ninigret, Subdury, and Tisbury soils are in similar terrace positions, but formed in loamy over sandy materials.  The Deerfield, Merrimac, and Windsor soils are in similar terrace positions, but formed in sandy or gravelly material.  The Hadley, Limerick, Occum, Ondawa, Podunk, Pootatuck, Rippowam, Rumney, and Winooski soils are on adjacent flood plains."
