Depth to\nthe fluctuating water table is 12 to 24 inches from spring\nthrough early summer.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges\nfrom 15 to 35 percent between depths of 0 and 25 inches.\nDepth to the 2C horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  The\nparticle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay\nand less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine\nsand.  Gravel content is 0 to 10 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4\nmoist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is\nvery strongly or strongly alkaline with lime disseminated\nthroughout.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or\n7 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam,\naveraging 12 to 18 percent clay.  It has common to many\ndistinct or prominent mottles.  It is moderately or mildly\nalkaline with lime disseminated throughout the horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry and\nchroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, averaging 7 to\n12 percent clay.  It is moderately or mildly alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and\nchroma of 2 moist and dry.
