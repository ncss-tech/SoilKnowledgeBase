  "OVERVIEW": "The Haines series consists of deep, poorly drained soils on\nflood plains and broad alluvial terraces.  They formed in\nmixed alluvium with an influence of loess and volcanic ash\nin the surface horizons.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The\nmean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean\nannual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Gravel content is 0 to 10 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4\nmoist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is\nvery strongly or strongly alkaline with lime disseminated\nthroughout.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or\n7 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam,\naveraging 12 to 18 percent clay.  It has common to many\ndistinct or prominent mottles.
