  "OVERVIEW": "The Halstead series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Halstead soils are on glacial valley walls and mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 940 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
