  "OVERVIEW": "The Hatmaker series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glaciofluvial deposits overlying silty materials weathered from shale on moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
