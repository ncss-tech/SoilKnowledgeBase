  "OVERVIEW": "The Heeland series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained, moderately permeable soils on hillslopes of uplands.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from noncalcareous sandstone. Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.",

The soil contains no free carbonates and ranges from moderately acid to neutral. Some soils have gravelly sandstone rock fragments between 15 and 35 percent by volume in any horizon.\nThe A and AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, or their gravelly counterparts.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loam, loamy sand or sandy loam or their gravelly counterpart. Some pedons do not have a C horizon."

The soils formed in residuum weathered from noncalcareous sandstone of the Dakota formation.  Where these soils occur, bedrock outcrops are common.  The annual temperature ranges from 52 to 55 degrees F, and the annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 35 inches.  Frost-free days range from 165 to 175."

Lancaster soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on similar topographic positions as Heeland soils.  Morrill and Yutan soils are very deep with more clay and less sand in the particle size control section and have an argillic horizon.  All of these soils are higher on the uplands."
