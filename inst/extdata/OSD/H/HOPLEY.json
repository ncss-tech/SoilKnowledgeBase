The noncalcareous part of the solum is 12 to 18 inches thick.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y throughout the soil.  The A1 horizon is loam or fine sandy loam with value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B2, B3, and Cca horizons are loam containing 10 to 18 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent coarser than very fine sand.  IIC horizons of soft sandstone, silty shale or gravelly sand occur below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

Tally soils have more than 35 percent coarser than very fine sand in their control sections.  Panguitch soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 18 inches and formed in alluvium of volcanic origin.  Relan soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Victor soils have gravelly sand layers at depths of 20 to 30 inches."
