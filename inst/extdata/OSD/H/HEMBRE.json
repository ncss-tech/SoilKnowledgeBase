    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist and they are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F. The depth to bedrock and thickness of the solum is most commonly 40 more than 60 inches. The solum is strongly or very strongly acid. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches. The upper 3 to 7 inches of the epipedon has an acid-oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, and 15-bar moisture of more than 15 percent. The lower part to a depth of 20 inches has an acid-oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 1.0 g/cc. Andic soil properties do not extend beyond 14 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry. The A1 horizon is medial silt loam and the A2 horizon is silt loam or medial silt loam. Fragments of rock and concretions of 1 to 2 mm. size are common to many in the A horizon. It has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 15 percent are basalt gravel, 0 to 15 percent are cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent are stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam that ranges to a heavy silt loam. The Bw1 and Bw2 horizons have a rock fragment content similar to the A horizon.\nThe BC horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist and dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty loam and has 0 to 35 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 35 percent are gravel, 0 to 15 percent are cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent are stones."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hembre soils are on summits, benches and side slopes of mountains at elevations of 200 to 2,800 feet in the Coast Range. The soils formed in residuum weathered from basalt and breccia. Winter is cool and moist, and summer is warm and dry. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 120 inches. The mean July temperature is 61 degrees F. and the mean January temperature is 38 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 100 to 210 days."

Kilchis and Klickitat soils contain more than 50 percent coarse fragments in their sola. The Kilchis soils, in addition, are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock. Neskowin soils have thick black A horizons and an isomesic soil temperature regime. Astoria, Blachly, and Winema soils are associated where underlying rocks are sedimentary. All of these soils have fine texture in the B horizon. Also, Astoria soils have 10YR or 7.5YR hue, Blachly soils have 2.5YR hue, and Winema soils have thick black A horizons and an isomesic soil temperature regime."

If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nADDITIONAL DATA: characterization data for one pedon (S84-Oreg.-041-002; #84P896) from Lincoln County Area, Oregon; Lincoln National Soil Survey Lab.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
