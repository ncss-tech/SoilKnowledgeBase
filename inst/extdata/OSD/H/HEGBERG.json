    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mantle and depth to fine loamy till ranges from 0 to 41 cm. The depth to dense till ranges from 152 to 203 cm.  Depth to free carbonates is greater than 203 cm.  Volume of rock fragments throughout the upper mantle and fine loamy till ranges from 1 to 12 percent with 1 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 1 percent cobbles and 0 to 1 percent stones and boulders. Rock fragment content in the dense till ranges from 8 to 25 percent with 8 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones and boulders.  The mantle averages less than 18 percent clay. The argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 25 percent clay. The fine loamy till ranges from 16 to 22 percent clay and contains less than 45 percent sand. The dense till ranges from 3 to 10 percent clay and contains less than 72 percent sand.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3. Dry color value is 5 or less.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an E/B or B/E horizon that does not meet the criteria for a glossic horizon. The E part has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. The Bw horizon typically has faint to distinct Fe concentrations and depletions. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, clay loam or silt loam. This horizon has redoximorphic features in most pedons. Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam or silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3BCd horizon has a hue of 5YR or 2.5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 8 to 25 percent with 8 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones and boulders. It is firm or very firm. It is moderately acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils typically occur on simple slopes of 0 to 3 percent. They are on foot slopes and summits of moraines. This soil formed in a discontinuous mantle of eolian or water laid sediments and the underlying friable loamy till and the underlying dense loamy till. The till is from the Superior Lobe of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 625 to 750 mm. The frost free season ranges from 120 to 140 days. The elevation ranges from 300 to 500 meters above sea level."

The poorly drained Eldes and very poorly drained Wahbegon both occur on plane or concave positions in addition the Eldes soil can occur on toeslopes.  The well drained Forbay soils occur on shoulder and backslopes."

The Hegberg soils have perched seasonal high saturation as high as 33 cm from the surface during spring in normal years."

Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
