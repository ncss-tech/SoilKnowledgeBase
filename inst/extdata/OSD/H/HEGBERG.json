  "OVERVIEW": "The Hegberg series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in a thin, discontinuous mantle of eolian or water-laid sediments and the underlying friable till and the underlying dense till on moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 690 mm.",
