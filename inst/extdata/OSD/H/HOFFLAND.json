  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoffland series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in sandy eolian deposits on swales on interdunes on sandhills of the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location.",
