It is gravelly or very gravelly loam with 15 to 60 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 15 percent can be cobbles.  It is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  It is gravelly or very gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly loam, or very cobbly loam averaging 25 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent rock fragments of which 15 to 45 percent are cobbles.
