  "OVERVIEW": "The Hopeka series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Hopeka soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
