  "OVERVIEW": "The Hypoint series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Hypoint soils are on fan aprons, fan skirts and alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",

Amole soils have no layers with more than 35 percent rock fragments and contain a high content of biotite and magnetite. Amole soils are in the 8 to 12 inch precipitation zone. Challenger soils are dry within the soil moisture control section from July through September. Livefire soils have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments and sandy loam texures in the particle-size control section. Orwash soils are dominated by coarse sands and 2 to 5 mm pebbles and have a mean annual soil temperature of 59 to 63 degrees F. Redington soils have brittle dense layers and more than 20 percent rock fragments in all horizons. Shortbread soils have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Yellowrock soils are dry from May through November and do not receive the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation."
