    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amole T(AZ), Challenger (CA), Livefire (CA), Orwash (NV), Redington (AZ), Shortbread (AZ) and Yellowrock (CA) series. Amole soils have no layers with more than 35 percent rock fragments and contain a high content of biotite and magnetite. Amole soils are in the 8 to 12 inch precipitation zone. Challenger soils are dry within the soil moisture control section from July through September. Livefire soils have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments and sandy loam texures in the particle-size control section. Orwash soils are dominated by coarse sands and 2 to 5 mm pebbles and have a mean annual soil temperature of 59 to 63 degrees F. Redington soils have brittle dense layers and more than 20 percent rock fragments in all horizons. Shortbread soils have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Yellowrock soils are dry from May through November and do not receive the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation."
