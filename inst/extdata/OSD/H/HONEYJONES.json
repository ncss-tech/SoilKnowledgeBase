  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Honeyjones soils are on mountains and breaklands. Slopes range from 15 to 85 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, mainly siltite and argillite, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Elevations range from 2,200 to 4,900 feet (671 to 1494 meters). The average annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 26 to 45 inches (660 to 1143 mm). The average frost-free period is from 60 to 120 days."

Hugus soils are on foothills and dissected terraces, and have loamy-skeletal argillic horizons. Latour soils are on mountain slopes at higher elevations and are cryic. Lotuspoint soils are on south-facing ridges and canyonsides, and are mesic and have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Pinecreek soils are on south-facing mountain slopes and have an umbric epipedon."
