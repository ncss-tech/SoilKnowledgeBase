  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Honeyjones series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains and breaklands. They formed in material weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, mainly siltite and argillite, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 15 to 85 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F and average annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",
