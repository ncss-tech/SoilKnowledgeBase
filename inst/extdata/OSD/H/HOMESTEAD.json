  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The silty loess mantle ranges from 6 to 10 inches thick, with the solum developed in the loess mantle.  The mantle is often stratified with thin layers of volcanic ash.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 33 to 37 degrees F.  The 10 to 40 inch control section occurs in the glacial sediments.  The control section, after mixing, is loamy-skeletal, with the fine earth fraction ranging from silt loam to sand.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Below the control section, sandy skeletal textures are dominant.\nAn A horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue from 10YR through 5Y, value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has, value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam. Stratas of ash are common.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value moist from 4 to 6, and chroma moist from 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.  Stratas of ash are common.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value and chroma moist from 3 through 8.  Consistence is loose or very friable."

Hood, Remedios, and Tennex series in the same family, and the Bernice, Kashwitna, Lucile, Nikishka, and Nondalton series. Conto soils have a mean annual soil temperature greater than 38 degrees F.  Dinzer, Evaro, Lastance, Mt.Hood, and Tennex soils lack a loess mantle.  Bernice and Nikishka soils are sandy-skeletal. Kashwitna soils are medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Lucile soils are bisequal and have mottled, convoluted A2 and B horizons.   Nondalton soils have a spodic horizon high in organic carbon.  Mitkof and Remedios soils do not contain layers of volcanic ash."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Homestead soils are on glaciofluvial outwash plains and moraines.  The soils formed in a thin silty loess mantle over gravelly glacial deposits.  The climate is transitional between maritime and continental with the average annual precipitation ranging from 17 to 24 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 32 to 34 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent."
