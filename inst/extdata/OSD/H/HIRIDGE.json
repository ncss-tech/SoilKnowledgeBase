    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hiridge soils are on mountains. They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope of mountains. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic or granitic rocks. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,380 to 3,400 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
