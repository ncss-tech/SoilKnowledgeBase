The particle-size control section averages 45 to 55 percent and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Mineralogy is smectitic.  Reversible surface-initiated cracks 0.25 to 1 inch, (0.6 to 3 cm) wide extend to a depth of 14 inches, (36 cm) from 150 to 180 days when the soil is not irrigated.  A fluctuating water table can occur between 60 inches, (152 cm) and the surface of the soil from December through May.  Redoximorphic features such as soft oxidized iron masses with colors of 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6 occur throughout.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles.  Some pedons have a Bss horizon.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/2 or 10YR 5/1.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2 or 10YR 4/1.  Texture is clay, gravelly clay or cobbly clay.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/2, 6/3, 7/4 or 10YR 4/1.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3, 5/4 or 10YR 4/1.  Texture is clay, gravelly clay, very gravelly clay or extremely gravelly clay.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon dry color is 2.5Y 6/2 or 10YR 4/1.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/2 or 10YR 4/1.  Texture is extremely gravelly clay, extremely gravelly sandy clay, cobbly clay or very gravelly sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 30 to 60 percent.

The soils are occasionally flooded for brief periods in December through March.  Water frequently ponds up to 2 inches, (5 cm) above the surface for brief duration from December through March.  A fluctuating water table can occur between 60 inches (152 cm) and the surface of the soil from December through May.  Surface water accumulates from local runoff and subsurface flow and flows slowly during periods of intense rainfall events."
