Lenses of fine sand and coarse sand can be found throughout the solum in some pedons. Reaction of the solum ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid. Depth to redoximorphic features ranges from 61 to 100 centimeters.\nThe A horizon, where present has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The A and E horizons are sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR, or 7.5YR; value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Croswell, Croswood, Cublake, Gilchrist, Heinz, Manitowish, Mattix, Neconish, and Noseum series. Croswell soils have spodic horizons that are lower in sesquioxides and organic carbon. Croswood soils have 2C horizons of loamy glacial till at 102 to 152 centimeters. Cublake soils are underlain by stratified loamy and sandy lacustrine materials. Gilchrist soils have 2C horizons of sandy loam glacial till at 51 to 102 centimeters. Manitowish soils have a loamy mantle 38 to 51 centimeters thick. Mattix soils have a loamy mantle 38 to 76 centimeters thick and are saturated from 15 to 46 centimeters during the winter. Neconish soils have a particle size control section that averages 50 percent or more fine sand. Noseum soils have a loamy mantle 25 to 51 centimeters thick"
