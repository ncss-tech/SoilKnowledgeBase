    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Croswell, Croswood, Cublake, Gilchrist, Heinz, Manitowish, Mattix, Neconish, and Noseum series. Croswell soils have spodic horizons that are lower in sesquioxides and organic carbon. Croswood soils have 2C horizons of loamy glacial till at 102 to 152 centimeters. Cublake soils are underlain by stratified loamy and sandy lacustrine materials. Gilchrist soils have 2C horizons of sandy loam glacial till at 51 to 102 centimeters. Manitowish soils have a loamy mantle 38 to 51 centimeters thick. Mattix soils have a loamy mantle 38 to 76 centimeters thick and are saturated from 15 to 46 centimeters during the winter. Neconish soils have a particle size control section that averages 50 percent or more fine sand. Noseum soils have a loamy mantle 25 to 51 centimeters thick"
