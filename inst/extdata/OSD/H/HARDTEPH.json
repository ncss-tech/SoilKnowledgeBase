  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hardteph soils are on mountains and hills.  They typically occur on shoulder or backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic rocks such as quartzite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,045 to 2,625 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
