  "STATES": "MI,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hamre series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in a thin mantle of organic material overlying loamy, calcareous till or lacustrine sediments on lake plains, moraines. and till plains.  These soils have moderate or moderately slow permeability. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 23 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F.",

The mineral soil contains 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and the clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent. The organic soil may contain a hemic layer up to 4 inches thick.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, or is N2/0 or N3/0. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, or is N2/0 or N3/0. Texture fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, and silt loam and the mucky analogues. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg or Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to2. Few to many distinct and prominent redoximorphic features are present. It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam. Textures of silt loam and silty clay loam occur where a lacustrine mantle is present. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons are slightly acid or neutral in the upper part.\nThe Cg, BCg, CBkg, or BCkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has textures of loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. It has 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.35 to 1.60 g/cc. Thin coarser textured layers are in some pedons."

These soils formed in a thin layer of organic soil material overlying calcareous loamy till or lacustrine sediments of the late Wisconsinan age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 28 inches. Frost-free days range from 88 to 140 days. Elevation above sea level ranges from 750 to 1,600feet."

The Chilgren, Roliss, Smiley, and Vallers soils lack histic epipedons, are better drained, and are on higher lying positions. The Northwood soils are in similar landscape positions and have a sandy mantle overlying loamy sediments."
