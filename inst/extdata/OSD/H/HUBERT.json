Ayon soils averages more than 18 percent clay and is dominated by stone and cobble. Curabith soils have mollic epipedons less than 10 inches thick and are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section periodically during May and June. Hogadero soils have strongly cemented calcic horizons. Mextank soils have lithologic discontinuities in the lower pedon containing stratified materials. Modyon soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Pena soils have coarse fragments dominantly consisting of caliche fragments, the majority of which are less than 10 inches in diameter."

Slopes are dominantly 2 to 5 percent and range from 1 to 9 percent.  These soils formed in Tertiary alluvium containing fragments of quartzite, sandstone, limestone, travertine, basalt and andesite.  The climate is semiarid continental with an average annual precipitation of 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 150 days."

Tours soils lack a mollic epipedon or a calcic horizon and have subsoil colors redder than 7.5YR."
