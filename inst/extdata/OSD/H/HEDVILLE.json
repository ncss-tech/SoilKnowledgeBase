JRF, JGA, BKN\n02/2020\nHEDVILLE SERIES\nThe Hedville series consists of shallow and very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone. Hedville soils are on hillslopes of uplands in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills in MLRA 74. Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 740 millimeters (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F), at the type location.",
