  "OVERVIEW": "The Houlihan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, and colluvium derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock. Houlihan soils are on hills, mountain slopes, swales and fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 480 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
