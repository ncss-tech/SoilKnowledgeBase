  "OVERVIEW": "The Hussell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks with a component of volcanic ash. Hussell soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
