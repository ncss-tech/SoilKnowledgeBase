  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness is commonly 24 to 36 inches but ranges from 22 to 45 inches.  Thickness of the loamy deposit ranges from 20 to 36 inches, and commonly the solum is in most of this deposit.  Silt content in the loamy mantle averages more than 30 percent.  The solum, other than the Ap which is usually neutral, is slightly acid to strongly acid.  The C horizon is medium acid or slightly acid.  Free carbonates are not in the pedon to a depth greater than 5 feet.  The upper loamy deposit has 0 to 10 percent pebbles by volume.  The underlying deposit contains 5 to 60 percent pebbles by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The lower value (color) is in the A horizon.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have a thin, nondiagnostic layer which is darker in color and is high in organic matter between the A horizon and E horizon.\nThe E horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nHalder soils have E/B or B/E horizons, or both.  The E/B or B/E have tongues of E material surrounding thin, columnarlike upward extensions of Bt horizons or wholly surrounding small isolated remnants of the Bt horizon.  The tongues of E have 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Mottles are few to common and distinct or prominent.  A hue of 5YR is common for mottles.  Textures of the component parts of E/B or B/E are similar to their respective E and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt part of the horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.\nThe Bt horizon has 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 3 through 6; and chroma of 2 through 8.  A hue of 5YR or 7.5YR is common for mottles.  It is silt loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Clay films are faint to distinct and patchy on faces of peds.  It is estimated to average between 18 and 25 percent clay and between 15 and 50 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe 2BC or 2Bt horizon has 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 3 through 6; and chroma of 2 through 8.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly analogues.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 8.  It consists of medium and coarse sands with 5 to 60 percent pebbles by volume.  It typically is sand or coarse sand stratified with gravel, but in some pedons it is gravelly or very gravelly coarse sand or sand, or gravelly loamy sand."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Halder series is the only member in this family.  Other closely related series are Altoona, Oesterle, Poskin, and Udolpho.  Altoona soils are underlain with sandstone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Oesterle soils are coarse-loamy.  Poskin soils are fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Udolpho soils are also fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal but are mesic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in loamy deposits 20 to 36 inches thick over acid sand and gravel.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 34 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F."

The well drained Onamia soils, the moderately well drained Scott Lake soils, and the poorly and very poorly drained Warman soils formed in similar deposits and form a drainage sequence with the Halder soils.  The well drained, fine-silty Antigo soils and very poorly drained, fine-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal Rib soils are nearby in some places."
