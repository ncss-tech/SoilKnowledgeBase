  "OVERVIEW": "The Huntdale series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability.  They formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part, that weathered from felsic high-grade metamorphic or igneous rock.  These soils are commonly on shaded ridges and north- to east-facing side slopes (cool aspects) in the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B.  Slope ranges from 8 to 95 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F., near the type location.",

Slopes are dominantly 30 to 70 percent, but ranges from 8 to 95 percent.  Elevation ranges from about 1,500 to 4,500 feet.  Huntdale soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part, weathered from felsic high-grade metamorphic or igneous rocks such as gneiss, granite and granitoids.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 47 to 57 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from about 110 to 160 days, and the average annual rainfall ranges from about 48 to 64 inches."

Ashe, Buladean, Chestnut, Cleveland, and Edneyville soils are coarse-loamy and have ochric epipedons.  Clifton soils are fine and have an ochric epipedon. Cowee, Evard, Edneytown, and Pigeonroost soils have argillic horizons, and have ochric epipedons. Plott, Porters, and Unaka soils have less silt in the particle size control section and Plott has an 10 to 20 inch thick umbric epipedon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Soils now included with the Huntdale series were previously mapped with Porters or Trimont soils.  Porters soils have less clay in the particle size control section and are deep to bedrock.  Trimont soils have an argillic horizon.  The clay content of the particle-size control section for Huntdale soils averages about 18 percent.  The total silt content ranges from about 35 to 50 percent.  The fine silt fraction averages about 35 percent and ranges from about 20 to 40 percent.  According to engineering index data, a large portion of the silt content is very fine silt.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric- epipedon - the zone from the soil mineral surface to a depth of 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 9 inches to 44 inches (Bw1 and Bw2, and BC  horizons)\nSIR = NC0245        MLRA = 130B"
