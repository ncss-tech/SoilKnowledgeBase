    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no othe series in this family. Porters, Tusquitee, and Unaka  series are in closely related families having isotic mineralogy. In addtion, these soils have less silt in the particle size control section. Porters and Unka soils formed in residuum and occur on ridgetops and sied slopes. Tusquitee soils formed in colluvium in coves."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Huntdale soils are on shaded ridges and north- to east-facing side slopes (cool aspect) on low and intermediate mountains, commonly where there is a plane or convex surface.  Slopes are dominantly 30 to 70 percent, but ranges from 8 to 95 percent.  Elevation ranges from about 1,500 to 4,500 feet.  Huntdale soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part, weathered from felsic high-grade metamorphic or igneous rocks such as gneiss, granite and granitoids.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 47 to 57 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from about 110 to 160 days, and the average annual rainfall ranges from about 48 to 64 inches."

Ashe, Buladean, Chestnut, Cleveland, Clifton, Cowee, Edneytown, Edneyville, Evard and Pigeonroost are on adjacent south- to west-facing landforms.  Ashe, Buladean, Chestnut, Cleveland, and Edneyville soils are coarse-loamy and have ochric epipedons.  Clifton soils are fine and have an ochric epipedon. Cowee, Evard, Edneytown, and Pigeonroost soils have argillic horizons, and have ochric epipedons. Plott, Porters, and Unaka soils have less silt in the particle size control section and Plott has an 10 to 20 inch thick umbric epipedon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Soils now included with the Huntdale series were previously mapped with Porters or Trimont soils.  Porters soils have less clay in the particle size control section and are deep to bedrock.  Trimont soils have an argillic horizon.  The clay content of the particle-size control section for Huntdale soils averages about 18 percent.  The total silt content ranges from about 35 to 50 percent.  The fine silt fraction averages about 35 percent and ranges from about 20 to 40 percent.  According to engineering index data, a large portion of the silt content is very fine silt.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric- epipedon - the zone from the soil mineral surface to a depth of 9 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 9 inches to 44 inches (Bw1 and Bw2, and BC  horizons)\nSIR = NC0245        MLRA = 130B\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE; pedon number S88NC-121-008A.\nRevised 02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
