  "OVERVIEW": "The Holillipah series consists of stratified very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. Holillipah soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of O to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F. The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F the entire year. The soil between depths of 14 and 43 inches is dry in all parts from May through October, and is moist in some or all parts from November through April unless irrigated. The difference between average July and average January soil temperature is 30 degrees to 33 degrees F. The soil is stratified with thick Layers of sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand and in some profiles thin layers of fine sandy loam, sandy loam and silt loam. The particle-size control section averages loamy sand or coarser. Strata of sandy loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam 1/2 1 cm thick can occur above 40 inches. Organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth. It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has dry color of l0YR 6/4, 6/3, or 6/2 and moist color of l0YR 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, or 3/3. It is sandy loam or loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has dry color of l0YR 8/1, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 6/3, 6/4 or 5/3 and moist color of l0YR 7/1, 7/2, 6/2, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 3/3. Mottles may be relic from initial deposition and are associated with the finer textured stratified layers and not indicative of an intermittent high water table. Gravel content ranges from O to 14 percent."
