  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hargran soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on concave shoulder positions.  These soils formed in till derived from mixed rocks and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium or high surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability (high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table occurring between 24 and 40 inches (moderately deep free water occurrence class) in a 3 to 10 inch zone from April to June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory.  The water table only occurs during spring and early summer following melting of winter snowpack when water moves laterally above the bedrock."

The native vegetation is a forest canopy of mainly California red fir, lodgepole pine, western white pine, white fir and mountain hemlock with an understory of sedge, bluegrass spp., and various forbs."
