  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic material is 51 to more than 90 inches.  It is extremely acid to neutral throughout the organic tiers but is very strongly acid to neutral in at least some part of the control section.  Underlying mineral layers are very strongly acid to slightly alkaliine.  Salinity is none or slight in more than half of the subsurface and bottom tiers.\nThe A1 horizon, present in most pedons, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, silt loam, mucky silt loam, or loam.\nThe surface tier has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Chroma, and less frequently value, will decrease by one unit when pressed or rubbed.  After rubbing, the organic material of the surface tier has less than 20 percent fibers.\nThe other organic tiers have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The subsurface tier contains as much as 50 percent fibers undisturbed, but less than 15 percent after rubbing.  The bottom tier contains as much as 30 percent fibers undisturbed, but less than 10 percent after rubbing.\nFibers throughout the profile dominantly are herbaceous.  Some pedons have as much as 35 percent woody fibers in the control section.  Logs, dominantly cypress, and large fragments of wood, in varying stages of decomposition, are in the lower part of the organic material of most pedons.  There is as much as 35 percent mineral matter in the organic layers.  The organic layers are underlain by mineral soil material that is variable in texture, ranging from sand to clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  (This section not updated this date; 6/16/97) These are the Lafitte and Maurepas series.  Lafitte soils have SAR of more than 13 or ESP of more than 15 in more than half of the subsurface tier.  Maurepas soils are developed from dominantly woody fibers and are medium acid to moderately alkaline throughout the profile.  The Allemands, Belhaven, Dare, Delcombe, Dorovan, Handsboro, Pamlico, Ponzer, and Pungo are similar series in other families.  Allemands, Belhaven, Delcombe, Pamlico, and Ponzer soils have less than 51 inches of organic material over mineral layers.  Dare, Dorovan, and Pungo soils have pH of less than 4.5 in 0.01 M calcium chloride, in all parts of the organic materials in the control section.  Handsboro soils have more than 0.75 percent sulfur content (dry weight) in the subhorizons within 12 to 40 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hobonny soils are on low nearly level to level areas of the Lower Coastal Plains at elevations that are generally less than 5 feet above mean sea level.  They normally occur within the flood plain of fresh water streams and are bordered on the seaward side by soils that are flooded with saline water.  Some areas are flooded with slightly saline water and some areas are protected from slightly saline water by dikes, roads, and other barriers.  The soils formed mainly in herbaceous plant remains mixed with a fair amount of woody plant remains and a small amount of mineral soil matter over a variety of marine and fluvial sediments.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F., near the type location.  The freeze-free season is about 257 days."
