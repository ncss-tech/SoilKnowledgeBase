  "OVERVIEW": "The Hogris soils consist of deep and very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in slope alluvium.  Hogris soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 20 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
