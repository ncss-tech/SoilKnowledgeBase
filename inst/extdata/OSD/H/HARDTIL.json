Lithology of fragments are mainly granitic rocks such as granodiorite.\nA horizons - Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nOrganic matter content: 2 to 4 percent.\nReaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid.\nBw horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nClay content: 8 to 15 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 60 percent.\nReaction: Moderately acid or slightly acid.\nRedoximorphic features: Redox concentrations occur as masses of iron accumulation.\nOther features: Some pedons lack cambic horizons when the Bw horizon is less than 6 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hardtil soils are on mountains.  They formed in till derived from mixed rocks and colluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 7,000 to 8,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 45 inches, mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; very high surface runoff; rapid permeability (high or very high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table occurring somewhere between 7 and 17 inches (very shallow or shallow free water occurrence class) from April to June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory.  The water table only occurs during spring and early summer when the snowpack melts and subsurface water moves laterally above the bedrock."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Hardtil soils are used for forest land, recreation, watershed, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly a forest canopy of lodgepole pine, Jeffrey pine, and Sierra juniper with an understory of sedge, bluegrass, needlegrass, snowberry, and currant."
