Copenhaver and Nieman soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Donkehill soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates and are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Layview soils are neutral or slightly alkaline and have mean annual soil temperature of 6 to 8 degrees C.  Maygal soils average 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have less than 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Mosroc soils have mean summer soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C, have argillic horizons that are neutral through moderately alkaline, and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Mountpatterson soils average 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have mean summer soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C.  Nielsen soils have 18 to 28 percent clay in the argillic horizon and are slightly acid or neutral.  Notstew soils have ashy textures in the A horizons, have mean annual soil temperature of 6 to 8 degrees C, and have argillic horizons that are neutral or slightly alkaline.  Thiefridge soils have O horizons, mean summer soil temperature of 10 to 12 degrees C, and a typic xeric moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hogmalat soils are on plateaus and mountains.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum derived from welded tuff.  Slopes are 3 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,865 to 2,320 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 480 to 640 mm, the mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 20 to 60 days."
