  "OVERVIEW": "The Hooligan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits over residuum. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, escarpments, hills, mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
