  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at the lithic contact ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry but are moist in some part between depths of 4 and 12 inches or to the bedrock, whichever is shallower for 60 to 75 consecutive days in late winter and spring.  The upper boundary of the limestone bedrock is at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  The control section is medium textured, contains more than 18 percent clay, and has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments, chiefly angular fragments of limestone.  The solum ranges from 0 to 10 inches thick.  The soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A1 horizon has a weak or very weak granular or platy structure.  It is slightly to strongly calcareous.  Organic matter to a depth of 15 inches or to bedrock, whichever is shallower, averages about 1 to 2.5 percent.  The C horizon is massive or has weak subangular blocky structure.  It is mildly to strongly alkaline but contains less than 5 percent identifiable powdery redeposited lime in a layer 6 inches thick."

Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent and have mostly southerly exposures.  The soils formed principally in residuum weathered from hard limestone, but many pedons have some loessal material or colluvium in the upper part.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches including 2 to 4 feet of snowfall.  The mean freeze-free period is 60 to 115 days."
