  "OVERVIEW": "The Honokaa series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash.  Honokaa soils are on mid elevation, windward slopes of Mauna Kea and have slopes ranging from 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 3175 millimeters (125 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).",

The soils are on summit, shoulder, backslope, and footslope hillslope profile positions of ash fields that overlie 64,000 to 300,000 year old lava flows.  Slope gradients typically range from 0 to 35 percent, but can be as great as 100 percent in gulches.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash.  The mean annual rainfall is 2000 to 3800 millimeters (78 to 150 inches).
