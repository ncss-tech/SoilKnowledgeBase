Akaka soils are moderately well drained with redox features in the A, Bw, and Bs horizons.  Honomanu soils have silty clay texture in the B horizons.  Honomanu and Kehena soils are moderately deep (50 to 100 cm {20 to 39 inches}) to bedrock.  Kaiwiki soils are strongly smeary throughout and have a perudic soil moisture regime.  Maile soils have a silt loam surface texture, a mean annual soil temperature of 17 degrees C (63 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation of 1900 millimeters (75 inches).  Moaula and Ohia soils are on younger Mauna Loa flows."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Honokaa soils are on mid elevation windward mountain slopes of Mauna Kea shield volcano at elevations from 335 to 1222 meters (1100 to 4000 feet).  Steep and narrow drainage gulches dissect the landscape.  The soils are on summit, shoulder, backslope, and footslope hillslope profile positions of ash fields that overlie 64,000 to 300,000 year old lava flows.  Slope gradients typically range from 0 to 35 percent, but can be as great as 100 percent in gulches.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash.  The mean annual rainfall is 2000 to 3800 millimeters (78 to 150 inches).  The mean annual temperature is 16 to 22 degrees C (61 to 72 degrees F) and the mean annual soil temperature is 19 degrees C (66 degrees F)."
