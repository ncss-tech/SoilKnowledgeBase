  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hassell series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from redbed siltstone, shale and sandstone from the Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Tertiary, and Quaternary periods.  These soils are on pediments below escarpments and/or truncated or beveled remnants of the redbed Formations.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm (14 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
