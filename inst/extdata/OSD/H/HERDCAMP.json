  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Carbonates are typically at the soil surface but may be leached to a depth of 10 inches in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 24 inches in thickness.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent.  The series control section contains less than 10 percent sand.  Mottles have hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR or are neutral, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 6 or less dry or moist.  They occur throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The electrical conductivity ranges from 1 to 3 mmhos/cm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y or is neutral, value of 3 or 4 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or less.   It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It contains many distinct or prominent mottles and few to common nests of gypsum and other salts.  The electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos/cm.  Thin strata of coarser textured materials are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  Growing season ranges from 125 to 150 days; growing season precipitation is about 12 to 17 inches; and growing degree days ranges from 2800 to 3300."

The moderately well or well drained Bullcreek soils contain more clay and are in slightly higher positions.  The well drained Lakoma and Opal soils have bedded shale within depths of 20 and 40 inches and are on back slopes.  The well drained Ottumwa and Promise soils are on adjacent foot slopes.  The moderately well drained, stratified Wendte soils are mostly on the larger flood plains."
