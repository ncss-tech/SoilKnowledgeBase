  "OVERVIEW": "The Hesperia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from granite and related rocks.  Hesperia soils are on alluvial fans, valley plains and stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 57 degrees to 71 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts, unless irrigated, from early May until early November.  Organic matter content is very low and decreases regularly with increasing depth.  The soils are typically calcareous between depths of 16 and 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has a dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 8/3 and 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2 and 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 6/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4, 5/4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or light loam, and has 0 to 5 percent rock fragments ranging from 2 mm to 2 cm.  This horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is similar in color to the A horizon.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Contrasting textures are excluded from the 10 to 40 inches control section although some fine or weak stratification is common.  Rock fragments 2 mm to 2 cm in diameter range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soil is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Lime is usually disseminated but a few pedons have lime veins in the lower part of the profile.  Some pedons have loamy sand substratums."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hesperia soils are on long smooth alluvial fans, and valley fill.  The alluvium is from granite and closely related rocks.  Elevations are as low as 200 feet in the San Joaquin Valley and as high as 4,800 feet in the high desert.  The climate is semiarid bordering on arid.  Winters have some general widespread rains plus occasional snow in the high desert.  Summers have infrequent thunder showers in the high desert.  Mean annual precipitation is 4 to 9 inches.  Average January temperature is about 46 degrees F; average July temperature is about 83 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 69 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 140 to 310 days.
