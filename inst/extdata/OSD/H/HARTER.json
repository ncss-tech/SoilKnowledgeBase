  "OVERVIEW": "The Harter series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from quartzite, shale, and sandstone.  Harter soils are on fan remnants, footslopes, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Elevation is 5,700 to 8,000 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",

The mean summer soil temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice and moist for 45 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the winter solstice in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma is 2 or 3 moist and dry..\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma is 2 to 4 dry and moist.  Texture is gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay.  It has moderate, medium prismatic or weak to strong, medium and fine, subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThere is a BC or C horizon below 50 inches in some pedons."
