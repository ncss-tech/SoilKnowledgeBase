The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons range from 40 to more than 60 inches. The particle size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice and moist for 45 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following the winter solstice in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma is 2 or 3 moist and dry..\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma is 2 to 4 dry and moist.  Texture is gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay.  It has moderate, medium prismatic or weak to strong, medium and fine, subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThere is a BC or C horizon below 50 inches in some pedons."
