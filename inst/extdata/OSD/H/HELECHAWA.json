  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more. Rock fragments, mostly sandstone channers, make up 0 to 35 percent of the solum and 5 to 80 percent of the substratum. Some pedons contain highly resistant quartzite gravel weathered from conglomerate. Reaction is commonly extremely to strongly acid throughout, but a few A horizons are moderately or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon is commonly less than 7 inches thick and has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or rarely silt loam.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is commonly sand, loamy sand, sandy loam or loam, but is clay loam or silty clay loam where underlain by soft shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Helechawa soils are on linear side slopes, benches, and foot slopes of hillsides and mountainsides. Slopes are dominantly 18 to 35 percent, but range from 5 to 75 percent. These soils formed in loamy colluvium weathered from Mississippian and Pennsylvanian clastics where siliceous sandstones predominate and are commonly located downslope of sandstone rock outcrops. Elevation ranges from about 600 to 3,800 feet. Near the type location mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in secondary growth forest with mixed stands of eastern hemlock, white oak, yellow-poplar, chestnut oak, American beech, scarlet oak, pitch pine, Virginia pine and hickory. Minor species include red maple, northern red oak, black oak, black gum, sourwood and black cherry. A few of the less sloping areas are used for pasture and as sites for homes and gardens."
