  "OVERVIEW": "The Hackleman Series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff or basalt.  Hackleman soils are on hills, and lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C.",
