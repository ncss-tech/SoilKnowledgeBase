Elevations are 1,400 to 3,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 15 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 71 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."
