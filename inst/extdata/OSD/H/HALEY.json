  "OVERVIEW": "The Haley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic ash over glacial outwash.  They are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",
