  "OVERVIEW": "The Healylake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy deposits on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
