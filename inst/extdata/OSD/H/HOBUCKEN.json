  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction in saturated soils is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  After initial drying, soil reaction is commonly strongly acid or very strongly acid and may range to extremely acid in some horizons.  However, reaction is stable on repeated drying and does not drop below 3.0.  The soil is frequently flooded with water containing 5 to 25 parts per thousand salt.  Subhorizons between 8 and 20 inches below the mineral surface have a n value of more than 0.7.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of N and value of 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or their mucky counterparts.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2; or hue of 5GY or 5G, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1.  It is stratified fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand to a depth of 40 inches.  Below 40 inches, the Cg horizon is stratified sandy, loamy, or clayey sediment.  Content of shell fragments ranges from none to many."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in this subgroup.  Series in closely related families are the Axis and Carteret series.  Axis soils have sulfidic material within 20 inches.  Carteret soils are sandy throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hobucken soils are on narrow to broad, marsh flats along brackish sounds, bays, rivers, and creeks.  The elevation is less than 2 feet above mean sea level and slope is less than 1 percent.  These soils formed in dominantly loamy textured Coastal Plain sediment.  Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches near the type location and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Carteret series and the Arapahoe, Ballahack, Bohicket, Brookman, Capers, Deloss, Lafitte, Masontown, Stockade, and Wasda series.  Arapahoe, Ballahack, Brookman, Deloss, Stockade, and Wasda soils are on marine or stream terraces, and the Masontown soils are in flood plains.  Those soils are in higher positions and are forested except for areas cleared for cropland or pasture.  The clayey Bohicket and Capers soils, the sandy Carteret soils, and the organic Lafitte soils are a similar landscape position with Hobucken in marshes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  These marshland areas are used as habitat for wetland wildlife and are important to the food chain of many commercial and sport fin fish as well as shell fish.  The vegetation is limited to species adapted to extreme wetness and exposure to salt.  The principal species is needlegrass rush.  Others include big cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, marshhay cordgrass, smooth cordgrass, saltmarsh bulrush, saltwort, Jamaican sawgrass, eastern baccharis, and seashore mallow."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included in mapping with Tidal Marsh.  It has some similarities to the Axis series, a coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, thermic Typic Sulfaquent, but does not flood with daily tides and lacks sulfidic material.  Spoil piles along extensive systems of ditches dug for mosquito control are quickly vegetated, indicating insignificant sulfur content.  Classification as a Hydraquent is provisional since details of definition for subgroups have not been developed and n values indicate soils marginal to Haplaquents.  Also, the brackish setting and salt content may place this soil in taxa of Aquents (Typic Halaquents) having halic properties outlined by Coover, et. al. if Taxonomy is amended to include these.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  pedon no.
