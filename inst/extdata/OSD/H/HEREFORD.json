Cambern and Chugcreek soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Cambern soils are moderately deep to tuff and ash. Chugcreek soils have a lithic contact of granite at moderate depths. Carfall, Schauson and Todacheene soils do not have carbonates. Center Creek soils have formed in alluvium, have redoximorphic features beginning at depths of 20 to 40 inches, and have very gravelly 2C horizons. Detra soils have redder hues. Detra soils have a lithic contact of limestone between 40 and 60 inches deep. Fiesta soils have rock fragments derived from granite, gneiss, and schist. Flaxton soils formed in eolian sediments and glacial till on till plains covered by eolian sediments.\nGordo soils have hues of redder than 10YR in the Bt horizon. Gordo soils have a paralithic contact of basalt and cinders at moderate depths. Hesperus soils are less alkaline in the B horizon and lack Bk horizons. Jaythree soils receive precipitation mostly during the months of November through March and July through October. In addition, Pachel soils have more than 25 percent rock fragments and Peta soils are saturated at depths of 2 to 4 feet at some time from April through June. Shermap soils formed in eolian deposits, and slope alluvium derived from sandstone. Todacheene soils formed in alluvium derived from basalt and basaltic tuff. Tschicoma soils formed in slope alluvium derived from latite, dacite, and rhyolitic tuff. Weed soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for some period immediately following July 1. Bowbells, Carfall, Chugcreek, Falxton, Hesperus, Laceycreek, Ohwiler, and Pachel soils are in LRRs E, F, and G and are moist in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hereford soils are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans.  They are formed in alluvium from basalt, basic tuff, sandstone and shale.  These soils occur at elevations of 6,900 to 7,300 feet in a continental climate, with a mean annual temperature of near 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season averages about 120 to 128 days.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches, about 60 percent of which falls in July, August and September."

Cambern soils are similar but lack the ca horizon that is characteristic of the Hereford soils and are noneffervescent throughout.  Luna soils are fine-textured and lack a ca horizon."
