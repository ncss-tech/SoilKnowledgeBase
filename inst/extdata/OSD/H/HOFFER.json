The Hoffer series is mapped in northeast Oregon in areas that support subalpine fir plant associations, which are indicative of a cryic soil temperature regime. The Vassar series is mapped in northeast Washington and northern Idaho in areas that support Douglas-fir, grand fir, ponderosa pine, western redcedar, and western larch, which are indicative of a frigid soil temperature regime (although the soils are classified as cryic). The frigid soil temperature regime appears to be correct for Vassar soils. The ash mantle of the soils in northeast Oregon have a higher content of glass and a higher percentage of ammonium oxalate Al plus 1/2 Fe than do the soils in northeast Washington and northern Idaho.\nThe ash in areas of Vassar soils mapped as cryic (if they exist) needs additional characterization before considering correlation to the Hoffer series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
