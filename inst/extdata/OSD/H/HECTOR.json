Stony, cobbly, very cobbly, gravelly and very gravelly phases are recognized.\nThe A1 horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark brown (10YR 3/3), brown (10YR 4/3, 7.5YR 4/2) or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  The A2 horizon is brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2) or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).  The fine earth fraction of the A horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon is dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), brown (10YR 5/3, 7.5YR 5/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), reddish brown (5YR 4/4) or yellowish red (5YR 4/6).
