  "OVERVIEW": "The Hemcross series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt, coarse-grained igneous rock, and other volcanic materials. Hemcross soils occur on summits, foot slopes, and toe slopes of mountains. Slopes are 3 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F. The particle-size control section has a clay content (field estimate) of 18 to 30 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter. It has 5 to 20 percent total rock fragments and 0 to 30 percent pararock fragments.  It has greater than 85 percent phosphate retention, 2.0 to 4.0 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 2.0 to 15 cmol/kg of KCL-extractable aluminum, and 15 to 30 percent 15-bar moisture (air dried). It is weakly or moderately smeary. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry. Texture is medial silt loam or medial loam with 15 to 25 percent clay by field estimate. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent paragravel. It has 8 to 12 percent organic matter.\nAn AB horizon is present in some pedons and has color and texture similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is medial silt loam, medial loam, medial clay loam, or medial silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay by field estimate. It has 0 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, 0 to 35 percent paragravel and 0 to 10 percent paracobbles.\nThe 2BC horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is very gravelly medial loam with 15 to 25 percent clay content by field estimate. It has 30 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles."

    "content": "REMARKS:Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - from the soil surface to a depth of 19 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon - from 19 to 48 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - from 2 to 42 inches\nAndic soil properties - the zone from 2 to 48 inches having andic properties and based on lab data from similar soils. Below a depth of approximately 48 inches, andic soil properties are absent primarily due to reduced organic matter and higher bulk density.\nClassification revised 8/97 by adding ferrihydritic mineralogy.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples collected and analysis run by O.S.U. and the NSSL; when samples were collected, the soil was mapped Hembre. Lab reference sample #s 84OR007003, 91OR067008, 92OR057100, and 93OR057010, from NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
