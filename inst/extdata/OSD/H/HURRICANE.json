  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 inches, or more.  Depth to the spodic horizon ranges from 51 to 79 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3; or is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Where the value is 3 or less, it is less than 10 inches in thickness.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 2.  Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of yellow and brown range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a transition horizon between the E and Bh.  It can be an EB, BE, or B/E horizon.  Hue is 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Discontinuous lenses or spodic bodies, thinly to moderately coated with colloidal organic matter are in some pedons.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 4 or less.  Sand grains are well coated with organic matter.  Black organic matter accumulations range from none to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Echaw, Mandarin, Melvina, Ridgeland, and Rigdon series.  The moderately well drained Echaw soils have a spodic horizon between depths of 30 to 50 inches.  Mandarin and Melvina soils have a Bh horizon within 30 inches of the surface.  Ridgeland soils do not have an E horizon above the Bh horizon.  Rigdon soils have an argillic horizon 20 to 40 inches below the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hurricane soils are on broad areas that are slightly higher than the adjacent flats of the Lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in sandy marine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F., and the annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

Albany, Blanton, Lutterloh and Plummer soils have argillic horizons from 40 to 80 inches from the surface and do not have spodic horizons.  In addition, Blanton soils are moderately well drained to somewhat excessively drained and Plummer soils are poorly drained.  Allanton and Pottsburg soils are poorly drained while Centenary soils are well to somewhat excessively drained.  Chipley, Foxworth, Kershaw, Lakeland, Ortega, Osier, and Rutlege soils are sandy throughout.  In addition, Foxworth soils are moderately well drained to somewhat excessively drained, Kershaw and Lakeland soils are excessively drained, Ortega soils are moderately well drained, Osier soils are poorly drained, and Rutlege soils are very poorly drained.  The poorly drained Leon soils have a Bh horizon within 30 inches of the surface.  The very poorly drained Murville soils have a Bh horizon immediately below the surface and an umbric epipedon."

Native vegetation consists of slash pine, longleaf pine, bluejack oak, turkey oak, and post oak with an understory of sawpalmetto, inkberry (gallberry), broomsedge, bluestem, and pineland threeawn (wiregrass).  A few areas have been cleared for improved bahiagrass pasture."
