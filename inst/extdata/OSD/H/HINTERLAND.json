  "OVERVIEW": "The Hinterland series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium derived from hard sandstone.  These soils are on bedrock-floored sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
