  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Holton soils are on flood plains along streams in areas considered to be of Illinoian Age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1168 mm (35 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 190 days. Elevation is 122 to 274 meters (400 to 900 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Holton soils are commonly associated with the Oldenburg and Wirt soils on flood plains, and the Cincinnati and Hickory soils on adjacent dissected till plains. Oldenburg soils do not have a layer above a depth of 51 cm (20 inches) that has a dominant chroma of 2 or less. They are on slightly higher steps on the flood plain. Wirt soils do not have iron depletions with a chroma of 2 or less in the control section. They are on natural levees adjacent to stream channels and slightly higher steps. Cincinnati soils have a fragipan in the control section, and are on shoulders and backslopes of dissected till plains. Hickory soils have an argillic horizon in the control section, and are on backslopes of dissected till plains."

In undrained areas, the depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the subsoil and moderately high or high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and moderate or moderately rapid in the underlying material."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The classification of the Holton series was changed from coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Aeric Fluvaquents to coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Aeric Endoaquepts in 1995. A cambic horizon is present in the majority of the pedons with lab data as of May 1995. Where Orrville series have been correlated in soil surveys in Indiana in MLRA 114, they will likely be re-correlated to the Holton series when these soil surveys are updated. The CEC activity class assigned is active, but lab data from the typical pedon borders the superactive class. Lab data indicates a regular decrease in organic-carbon content between 25 and 125 cm.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (14 inches) (Ap and BA horizons).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 36 to 104 cm (14 to 41 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 horizons).\nRedoximorphic features: from 18 to 152 cm (7 to 60 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data available for this series: Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University, Station Bulletin No. 323, File No. JF7701; Station Bulletin No. 360, File No. R17815 (typical pedon); and pedon S89IN-143-009 at the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
