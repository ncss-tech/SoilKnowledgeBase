  "OVERVIEW": "The Hunsinger series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium of intermixed tephra and extrusive igneous rock.  They are on lava plateaus and hills.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Thickness of the solum and depth to paralithic contact of strongly weathered basalt ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 to 51 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from mid March until late December (290 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F. from early May until early December.  The soil moisture control section (10 to 25 inches) is moist in some part from early December until mid May and dry in all parts from early July until early November (120 to 140 days).  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent to a depth of 30 inches.  Some pedons have an O horizon 2 to 6 inches thick. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  In some pedons the rock fragments are highly weathered near the paralithic contact.\nThe A horizon and BAt horizon color is 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/3, or 5/2.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  Rock fragments mostly gravel range from 15 to 35 percent.  Organic matter is 2 to 5 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon color is 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4, 4/6, or 4/4.  Moist color is 5YR 4/4, 3/4; or 7.5YR 4/4, or 3/4.  It is very gravelly sandy clay loam, cobbly sandy clay loam, and very cobbly sandy clay loam.  Clay content in the top 20 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from  20 to 27 percent.  Rock fragments, mostly subrounded cobbles, range from 35 to 80 percent in at least the top 20 inches of the argillic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Where basalt is weathered, recognizable clay films and manganese stains line fractures and cracks.  Colluvium is subangular to subrounded basalt that is slightly weathered to highly weathered.  Rock fragments become increasingly weathered with depth and in some pedons they are saprolitic or have weathering rings with manganese stains and clay films lining fractures.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon- The zone from 0 to 13 inches (A, BAt).\nArgillic horizon- The zone from 13 to 42 inches (2Bt1, 2Bt2).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 42 inches (2Cr).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Organic carbon data is by NSSL and Walkley-Black method in the survey office lab.  Base saturation is by NSSL and Hach Kit.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
