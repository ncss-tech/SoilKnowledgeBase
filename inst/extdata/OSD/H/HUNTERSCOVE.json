    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F., and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 45 percent clay and 25 to 50 percent soft rock fragments.  The fragments are weathered sandstone or siltstone and can be crushed.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  The profile is very strongly to strongly acid throughout.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  Organic matter is 4 to 8 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Clay films range from few to common and faint to distinct.  Organic matter is 2 to 4 percent."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from arkosic sandstone and siltstone.  Elevation is 50 to 1000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 270 days."
