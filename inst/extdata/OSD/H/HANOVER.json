  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum typically is more than 60 inches but ranges from 50 to 110 inches.  Depth to the fragipan is 16 to 35 inches.  Some pedons have a mantle of loess up to 16 inches thick and have 2B and 2C horizons.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel-sized subrounded fragments of sandstone and shale, are 2 to 25 percent, by volume, in the solum below any loess mantle and 5 to 35 percent in the C horizon.  Stony and very stony phases are recognized.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 of 3.  Some pedons have an A horizon up to 4 inches thick that has value of 2 or 3.  The Ap or A horizon commonly is silt loam or loam and less commonly their gravelly, stony, or very stony analogs.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has texture range similar to the A horizon.  It is very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 4 to 6.  Some pedons have mottles of high or low chroma, but mottles of low chroma are only in the lower part.  The Bt horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogs with subhorizons of silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogs.  It is medium acid to very strongly acid in the upper part and strongly acid or very strongly acid in the lower part.\nThe BC horizon has similar color and texture range as the Btx horizon.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has similar color range as the Btx and BC horizons.  It is loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analoges.  It is very strongly acid to mildly alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Annadale, Beltsville, Califon, Delassus, Laidig, Landisburg, Meckesville, Monongahela, Natalie, Tonti, Trego, and Watson series in the same family and the Wooster series.  Annadale and Califon soils have coarse fragments dominated by granite gneiss.  Beltsville soils have strong or very strong structure in the fragipan and have a few waterworn pebbles.  Delassus soils have coarse fragments dominated by grantic saprolite.  Laidig soils are more than 30 inches thick to the top of the fragipan and have more than 30 percent coarse fragments in the fragipan.  Landisburg soils have coarse fragments dominated by chert.  Meckesville, Trego, and Watson soils have fragipans the have redder hue.  Monongahela soils have waterworn coarse fragments.  Natalie soils require more study to adequately differentiate them from Hanover soils.  Tonti soils have more coarse fragments in the lower part of the fragipan and the coarse fragments are dominated by chert.  Wooster soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent, typically have sola less than 60 inches thick, and have a weakly expressed fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hanover soils are on till plains, moraines, and till-covered sandstone hills.  The slope range is dominantly 2 to 18 percent but ranges from 0 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in glacial till of Illinoian age.  A thin loess cap less than 16 inches thick is present in some areas, especially toward the southern part of the area of distribution.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 to 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 to 52 degrees F."

Chili, Conotton, Negley, and Parke soils are on nearby terraces.  Dekalb, Lordstown, and Loudonville soils are on till-covered sandstone hills where bedrock is at depths of less than 40 inches.  The somewhat poorly drained Gresham soils and moderately well drained Titusville soils are in a toposequence with Hanover soils and are on the lower parts of some slopes or in concave landscape positions."

Hanover soils are being restricted to that part of the Illinoian till plain from Richland County, Ohio, eastward into Pennsylvania.  Base saturation is consistently higher than 35 percent on lobes of the Illinoian glaciation south and west of Richland County.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data for the Hanover series include profiles CO-81 and RC-18 (the typical pedon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
