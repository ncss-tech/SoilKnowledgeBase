  "OVERVIEW": "The Hanover series consists of deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed in weathered Illinoian glacial till with a thin mantle of loess in some areas.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 40 percent.  Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow in the fragipan.  Mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Some pedons have a mantle of loess up to 16 inches thick and have 2B and 2C horizons.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel-sized subrounded fragments of sandstone and shale, are 2 to 25 percent, by volume, in the solum below any loess mantle and 5 to 35 percent in the C horizon.  Stony and very stony phases are recognized.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 of 3.  Some pedons have an A horizon up to 4 inches thick that has value of 2 or 3.  The Ap or A horizon commonly is silt loam or loam and less commonly their gravelly, stony, or very stony analogs.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has texture range similar to the A horizon.  It is very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 4 to 6.  Some pedons have mottles of high or low chroma, but mottles of low chroma are only in the lower part.  The Bt horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogs with subhorizons of silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogs.  It is medium acid to very strongly acid in the upper part and strongly acid or very strongly acid in the lower part.\nThe BC horizon has similar color and texture range as the Btx horizon.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has similar color range as the Btx and BC horizons.  It is loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analoges.  It is very strongly acid to mildly alkaline."

Annadale and Califon soils have coarse fragments dominated by granite gneiss.  Beltsville soils have strong or very strong structure in the fragipan and have a few waterworn pebbles.  Delassus soils have coarse fragments dominated by grantic saprolite.  Laidig soils are more than 30 inches thick to the top of the fragipan and have more than 30 percent coarse fragments in the fragipan.  Landisburg soils have coarse fragments dominated by chert.  Meckesville, Trego, and Watson soils have fragipans the have redder hue.  Monongahela soils have waterworn coarse fragments.  Natalie soils require more study to adequately differentiate them from Hanover soils.  Tonti soils have more coarse fragments in the lower part of the fragipan and the coarse fragments are dominated by chert.  Wooster soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent, typically have sola less than 60 inches thick, and have a weakly expressed fragipan."
