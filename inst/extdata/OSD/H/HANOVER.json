  "OVERVIEW": "The Hanover series consists of deep, moderately well drained and well drained soils formed in weathered Illinoian glacial till with a thin mantle of loess in some areas.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 40 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low above the fragipan and low in the fragipan.  Mean annual precipitation is about 965 centimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is typically greater than 183 centimeters but ranges from 150 centimeters to 280 centimeters.  Depth to the fragipan is 40 to 89 centimeters.  Some pedons have a mantle of loess up to 40 centimeters thick and have 2B and 2C horizons.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel-sized subrounded fragments of sandstone and shale, are 2 to 25 percent, by volume, in the solum below any loess mantle and 5 to 35 percent in the C horizon.  Stony and very stony phases are recognized.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 of 3.  Some pedons have an A horizon up to 4 inches thick that has value of 2 or 3.  The Ap or A horizon commonly is silt loam or loam and less commonly their gravelly, stony, or very stony analogs.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BA, BE, or E horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has texture range similar to the A horizon.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 4 to 6.  Some pedons have  redoximorphic features, but iron depletions of chroma 2 or less are only in the lower part.  The Bt horizon is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogs with subhorizons of silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogs.  It is moderately acid to very strongly acid in the upper part and strongly acid or very strongly acid in the lower part.\nSome pedons have BC horizons up to 76 centimeters thick that have similar color and texture range as the Btx horizon.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid. Some pedons also have C horizons with similar colors to Btx and BC horizons. C horizons are sandy loam, loam, clay loam, or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline."

Annadale and Califon soils have coarse fragments dominated by granite gneiss.  Beltsville soils have strong or very strong structure in the fragipan and have a few waterworn pebbles.  Delassus soils have coarse fragments dominated by grantic saprolite. Landisburg soils have coarse fragments dominated by chert.  Meckesville, Trego, and Watson soils have fragipans the have redder hue.  Monongahela soils have waterworn coarse fragments. Tonti soils have more coarse fragments in the lower part of the fragipan and the coarse fragments are dominated by chert.  York soils have sola less than 150 centimeters thick."

The soils formed in glacial till of Illinoian age.  A thin loess cap less than 40 centimeters thick is present in some areas, especially toward the southern part of the area of distribution.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1000 to 1175 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature is about 7.5 to 9.5 degrees C."

The somewhat poorly drained Alvira and Gresham soils, poorly drained Shelmadine, and moderately well drained Titusville soils are in a toposequence with Hanover soils and are on the lower parts of some slopes or in concave landscape positions."
