  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hawkstone series consists of deep, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability on rolling uplands and alluvial\nfans.  They formed in alluvium and residuum derived dominantly from sandstone.  In some areas the parent material has been reworked by wind.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 61 to 64 degrees F.  The moisture control section is dry in all parts for at least 60 consecutive days and 90 cumulative days from July 15 to November 15.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is mainly sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  However, it is loamy sand below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a calcareous 2C horizon below a depth of 40 inches.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
