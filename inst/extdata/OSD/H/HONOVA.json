  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the hard tuff is 10 to 36 cm.  The soil above the lithic contact is usually dry from mid-April to mid-November, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time; aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric. The soil temperature is above -13 degrees C from March 1 to December 15, but is rarely below -15 degrees C.  The mean annual soil temperature is 15 to 17.2 degrees C.  The soil surface has a 5 to 80 percent coverage of boulders, stones, cobbles, and gravel which are angular tuff fragments.  The gravel and cobbles predominate.  Surface stone and boulder coverage is 0 to 5 percent.  These soils contain 40 to 60 percent rhyolitic volcanic ash.  The soil is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Rock fragment content of the control section ranges from 5 to 30 percent, consisting of 0 to 3 percent stones, 0 to 30 percent cobbles, and 5 to 20 percent gravel.  These are angular tuff fragments.  The clay content of the textural control section averages 6 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3; 2.5Y 6/2 or 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2 or 7/2.\nThe A1 horizon textures are loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, cobbly loamy sand, very cobbly loamy sand and extremely cobbly loamy sand.  It contains 5 to 50 percent angular rock fragments consisting of 0 to 3 percent boulders and stones, 0 to 35 percent cobbles, and 5 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe A2 and A3 horizons textures are sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 25 percent consisting of 0 to 3 percent stones, 5 to 10 percent cobbles, and 5 to 20 percent gravel.  These are angular tuff fragments."

The soils formed in hard rhyolitic tuff at elevations of 1,310 to 1,740 meters.  Some of the fine-earth material is thought to be of mixed aeolian origin.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 250 mm, some as snow, and the mean annual temperature is 13.9 to 16.1 degrees C.  The mean January temperature is about 2.8 degrees C; the mean July temperature is about 24 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 140 to 175 days.  Rock outcrops are associated with these soils."

Organic carbon content lab data measurements are 0.1 to 0.3 percent.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in the profile are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A horizons).\nLithic contact - The layer at 18 cm (The R horizon).\nMineralogy:  Ashy, based on grain count by the NSSL, Lincoln Nebraska.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
