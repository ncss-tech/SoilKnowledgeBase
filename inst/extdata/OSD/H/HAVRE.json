  "OVERVIEW": "The Havre series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified, calcareous, loamy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
