  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hadar series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian or outwash sands and the underlying loamy glacial till on uplands.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy part and moderately slow in the till.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 24 inches and mean annual air temperature is 49 degrees F at the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to free carbonates typically is about 46 inches, but ranges from 28 to 60 inches or more.  Depth of the sandy material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  Typically, it is loamy fine sand, but the range includes loamy sand and sand.  Reaction is medium or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist with chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.  Reaction is medium or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 4 through 6 moist with chroma of 2 through 4.  The 2Bw and 2BC horizons contain accumulations of segregated soft lime in some pedons.  The 2Bw horizons are typically clay loam, but the range includes loam or sandy clay loam with the clay content averaging between 20 and 35 percent.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.  In places, a 2A horizon is formed in the till material.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Seams and pockets of soft lime accumulations are common.  Reaction is neutral or moderately alkaline."

Boelus soils contain more silt in the lower part of the control section.  Betts and Clarno soils contain more clay in the A and upper B horizons.  Dunn soils are moderately well drained, have loamy alluvium in the lower part of the control section.  Libory soils are somewhat poorly drained and have loess or silty alluvium in the lower part of the control section.  Loretto soils are fine-loamy.  Shue soils are somewhat poorly drained and mottled in the sandy part."

They formed in eolian or outwash sandy material over loamy glacial till.  The range of mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F, and the range of mean annual precipitation is 21 to 28 inches."

Bazile soils have sand at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are on similar landscapes.  Moody soils formed in deep loess and are generally higher in the landscape than Hadar soils.  Thurman soils are sandy throughout the profile and are generally higher in the landscape."
