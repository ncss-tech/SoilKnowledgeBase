    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Holbrook soils are on alluvial fans, fan aprons and inset fans in fan piedmont landscapes.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 2,195 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 38 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (parts of the A2 and C horizons).\nThe revision of April 2000 updated the taxonomic subgroup from Aridic to Torriorthentic Haploxerolls.  Holbrook soils either do not have cambic horizons or do not have parts of the mollic epipedon below 25 cm which would meet all requirements for cambic horizons except color.  Parts of the mollic epipedon below 25 cm in depth are not 15 cm or more thick and so would not meet the thickness requirement for cambic horizons.\nADITIONAL DATA: User Pedon ID: 2006NV005036.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
