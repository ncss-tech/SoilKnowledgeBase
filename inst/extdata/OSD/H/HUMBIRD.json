  "OVERVIEW": "The Humbird series consists of moderately well drained soils which are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with interbedded sandstone and shale.  They formed in loamy alluvium and in clayey residuum from the underlying interbedded sandstone and shale on pediments.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle, slow in the clayey residuum, and very slow to moderately slow in the sandstone and shale. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to the paralithic contact with interbedded sandstone and shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to the clayey residuum ranges from 12 to 30 inches. The upper part of the particle-size control section averages from 8 to 17 percent clay and from 45 to 70 percent fine sand or coarser.  The lower part of the particle-size control section averages from 35 to 60 percent clay.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent in the argillic horizon.  Coarse fragments are mostly sandstone channers but in many places, these soils occur near higher lying glacial soils and igneous pebbles are in the upper part of some pedons.  Volume of gravel or sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 3 to 15 percent in the residuum. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the loamy mantle but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the residuum.  Redox accumulations are below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. The A or Ap horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 8; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is dominantly clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay but thin subhorizons of coarser texture are in some pedons.\nThe 2Cr horizon has color like the 2Bt horizon described above.  It is interbedded sandstone and shale."
