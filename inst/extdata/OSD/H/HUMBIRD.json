  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to the paralithic contact with interbedded sandstone and shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to the clayey residuum ranges from 12 to 30 inches. The upper part of the particle-size control section averages from 8 to 17 percent clay and from 45 to 70 percent fine sand or coarser.  The lower part of the particle-size control section averages from 35 to 60 percent clay.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent in the argillic horizon.  Coarse fragments are mostly sandstone channers but in many places, these soils occur near higher lying glacial soils and igneous pebbles are in the upper part of some pedons.  Volume of gravel or sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 3 to 15 percent in the residuum. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the loamy mantle but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the residuum.  Redox accumulations are below the spodic horizon and within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. The A or Ap horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 8; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is dominantly clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay but thin subhorizons of coarser texture are in some pedons.\nThe 2Cr horizon has color like the 2Bt horizon described above.  It is interbedded sandstone and shale."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Related soils are the Fairchild, Hiles, Kert, Ludington, and Merrillan series.  Fairchild and Ludington soils have a 15 to 39 inch thick sandy mantle and have sandy over loamy particle-size.  Hiles and Kert soils are fine-loamy Glossoboralfs.  Merrillan soils have redox features and saturation in the spodic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on pediments underlain by interbedded sandstone and shale (Eau Claire and Mt. Simon formations of the Elk Mound group).  Slope gradients range from 1 to 20 percent. Humbird soils formed in 12 to 30 inches of loamy alluvium and in clayey residuum from the underlying interbedded sandstone and shale.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1,400 feet."

The poorly drained Elm Lake soils, the somewhat poorly drained Fairchild soils, and the moderately well drained Ludington soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is a 15 to 39 inch thick sandy mantle over loamy residuum from the underlying interbedded sandstone and shale.  The moderately well drained Hiles soils, the somewhat poorly drained Kert soils, and the poorly drained Veedum soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where there is a 12 to 30 inch thick silty mantle over loamy residuum from the underlying interbedded sandstone and shale.  The somewhat poorly drained Merrillan soils form a drainage sequence with Humbird soils."

Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle; slow in the residuum; and very slow to moderately slow in the interbedded sandstone and shale.  Humbird soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1.5 to 3 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period October to May in 6 or more out of 10 years."

Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest with northern red oak, red maple, jack pine, northern pin oak, and quaking aspen predominating.  Some areas are cleared and used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay.  Some areas are used for pastureland."
