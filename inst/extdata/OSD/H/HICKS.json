  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to weathered, rippable bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  These soils are medium acid or strongly acid, except the surface layer is less acid where limed.  Phosphate content is medium or high.  Thin flat rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the A, BA and Bt horizon, 5 to 15 percent in the 2Bt horizon and 25 to 60 percent in the 2BC and 2C horizons were present.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam, except a few severely eroded areas are silty clay loam.\nThe BA, Bt and 2Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of brown are few or common in the 2Bt horizon.  The BA horizon is silt loam, the Bt horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam and the 2Bt horizon is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of clay in the 2Bt horizon.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of brown and yellow range from few to many.  The fine earth texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of clay.\nThe 2Cr horizon is weathered siltstone that is interbedded with thin strata of sandstone, limestone and shale.  It is rippable and in most places can be dug with a spade.  Most of the rock is soft but includes some thin strata that is hard.  Some of the strata was calcareous prior to weathering and some strata contains phosphate nodules."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Armour, Barnsdall, Dexter, Dossman and Goodwill series in the same family and the Culleoka, Sandhill and Stiversville series in similar families.  Armour soils formed in old alluvium on stream terraces and footslopes and have a surface layer with a value of 3.  Barnsdall soils are on flood plains, have a hue of 5YR in the Bt horizon and are greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  Dexter soils formed in alluvium on stream terraces, have ped surfaces of 5YR in the Bt horizon and are greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  Dossman soils are 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt horizon and are greater than 60 inches to bedrock.  Goodwill soils formed in old alluvium and have sola greater than 60 inches thick.  Culleoka soils are mesic and are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Sandhill and Stiversville soils are fine-loamy because they have a higher sand content and more rock fragments in the upper part of the pedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These nearly level to sloping soils are on upland ridgetops.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  They formed in a loess mantle 1.5 to 3 feet thick and the underlying residuum of siltstone that includes thin strata of sandstone, limestone or shale.  Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is 60 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is 52 inches."

In addition, Inman soils are less than 40 inches to a paralithic contact and has limestone flags throughout the soil."
