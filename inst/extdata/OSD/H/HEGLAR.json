  "OVERVIEW": "The Heglar series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately\npermeable soils that formed in silty alluvium and loess. They are on\nfan terraces and hillslopes and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The\naverage annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C.",
