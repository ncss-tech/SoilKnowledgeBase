  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoodle series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium and colluvium from volcanic and mixed origins. These soils are on pediments and ridges. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.8 degrees C.",
