  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brownsburg, Crumstown, Eleva, Mecan, and Oshtemo series. Brownsburg soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Crumstown and Oshtemo soils are not clearly differentiated from the Hillsdale soils because of overlapping properties within the series control section and because the C horizons in these soils are not always present within the series control section. In addition, the redoximorphic features in the Crumstown soils are not always present within the series control section, and the Oshtemo series allows for a loamy substratum phase. Eleva soils have a paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Mecan soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the upper part of the Bt horizon."

Hillsdale soils formed in loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 11.7 degrees C (46 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

Oshtemo and Spinks soils are associated on low moraines. Oshtemo soils are at slightly lower elevations and Spinks soils are commonly at slightly higher elevations."
