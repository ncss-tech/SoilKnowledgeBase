The Amor and Azaar soils have a calcic horizon. The Diagulch, Max, Peerless, Prospect, Quigley, Shambo, Tansem, Twin Creek, and Yeoman series lack a lithic contact within 60 inches. Minnimaud soils do not have a cambic horizon and have paralithic materials consisting of fractured shale in the lower part or the series control section. Teweel soils are non calcareous throughout and have paralithic materials consisting of semiconsolidated shale in the lower part or the series control section."
