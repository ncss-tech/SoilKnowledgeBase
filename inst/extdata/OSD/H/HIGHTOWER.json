  "OVERVIEW": "The Hightower series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to bedrock.  Hightower soils formed in local\nalluvium from andesite and sandstone on hills.  Slopes are 3\nto 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches\nand mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
