  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel, range from 0 to 20 percent by volume throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Dry color value is 5 or less.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in this family.  Similar soils are the Ensign, Joliet, Romeo, Ruse, Tor and Torull series.  The Ensign, Ruse, Tor and Torull soils do not have mollic epipedons.  The Joliet and Romeo soils are mesic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hannawa soils are on upland benches and in shallow troughs where the mantle of regolith is thin over underlying sandstone, dolomitic, limestone, or marble bedrock.  In most places the regolith is composed of glacial till; however, in some places where the bedrock is fissile or easily weathered, the regolith consists of residuum.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches.  The growing season ranges from 120 to 150 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Guff, Isula, Matoon, Nehasne, and Summerville series.  Guff and Matoon soils are on similar topographic positions as Hannawa soils but are in fine families.  Insula, Nehasne, and Summerville soils are on higher, better drained landscape positions and have udic moisture regimes."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Hannawa soils have been cleared.  Some areas are in stages of forest succession, other areas are in natural pasture.  A few areas are under cultivation or are used for hayland.  Woodland species include Northern white cedar, balsam fir, trembling aspen, grey birch, and white ash."
