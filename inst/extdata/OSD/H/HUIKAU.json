Slope gradients range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash and cinders over `a`a lava.  The mean annual rainfall is about 380 to 889 millimeters (15 to 35 inches).  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 1780 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual air temperature is 9 to 14 degrees C (48 to 57 degrees F)."

On Mauna Kea, these are the Lanapohaku and Pohakulehu series.  Mawae soils are organic soils over `a`a lava.  Nenenui soils have a lithic contact at 5 to 25 centimeters (2 to 10 inches).  Puukala soils are medial-skeletal.  Lanapohaku soils do not contain any cinders. Pohakulehu soils are ashy-skeletal in the control section."
