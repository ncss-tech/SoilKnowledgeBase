  "OVERVIEW": "The Huikau series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash and cinders over `a`a lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 510 millimeters (20 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",

Slope gradients range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash and cinders over `a`a lava.  The mean annual rainfall is about 380 to 889 millimeters (15 to 35 inches).
