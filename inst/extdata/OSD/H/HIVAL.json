  "OVERVIEW": "The Hival series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from weathered sandstone and shale.  These soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 10 inches, and mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.",
