  "OVERVIEW": "The Hogsby series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from argillite and quartzite.  These soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
