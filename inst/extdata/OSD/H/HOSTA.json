Cuerva, Erramouspe, Nogal, Tinian, and Wilmac soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Durango soils are more moist in the spring and drier in the summer. Fikel soils have hue of 5YR and redder. Montecito soils have a calcic within 40 inches of the surface as is a Calcidic Haplustalfs. Ortiz soils are deep to bedrock and have 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonates in the lower part of the solum. Prater soils have more than 5 percent cobble plus stone in all parts of the profile."

These soils formed in stream and fan alluvium from shale and sandstone with some eolian deposits. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. Rain falls as intense summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain or snow. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
