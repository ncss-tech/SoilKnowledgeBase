  "OVERVIEW": "The Hosta series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stream and fan alluvium and eolian deposits derived from sandstone and shale. Hosta soils are on valley sides, stream terraces, drainageways, and plateaus. Slope is 1 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
