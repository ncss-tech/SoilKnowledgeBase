Upper 10 centimeters (4 inches) do not have enough glass to be andic.\nLithic contact - at 36 centimeters (14 inches) (3R horizon).\nParticle-size control section - from the soil surface to 36 centimeters (14 inches).\nSoil temperature - mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C. (iso temperature regime).\nSoil moisture - dry in some or all parts for a four-month period from June to September in most years (Ustic moisture regime).\nHeake is the old incorrect spelling of Hi`iaka.\nEdit Log: 12/03 KH. Added \"ashy\" modifier to textures.\n2/01 KH. Previous very high runoff and moderately rapid permeability changed to separate classes for areas with and without surface crust.\n9/99 KH. Type location changed. Classification changed due to changes in Taxonomy and new lab data. Old classification - Medial, isothermic Lithic Dystrandepts.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Heake NSSL sample S97-HI-001-002 from type location.\nPenetrometer measurement made by inserting penetrometer horizontally into \"in situ\" soil:\nA horizon - 1.25 tons/square/foot\nBw horizon - 2.00 tons/square/foot\nC1 horizon - 2.25 tons/square/foot\nC2 horizon - 0.75 tons/square/foot\nCd1 horizon - > 5.00 tons/square/foot\nCd2 horizon - > 5.00 tons/square/foot\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
