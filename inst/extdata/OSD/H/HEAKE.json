Upper 10 centimeters (4 inches) do not have enough glass to be andic.\nLithic contact - at 36 centimeters (14 inches) (3R horizon).\nParticle-size control section - from the soil surface to 36 centimeters (14 inches).\nSoil temperature - mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C. (iso temperature regime).\nSoil moisture - dry in some or all parts for a four-month period from June to September in most years (Ustic moisture regime).\nHeake is the old incorrect spelling of Hi`iaka.\nEdit Log: 12/03 KH. Added \"ashy\" modifier to textures.\n2/01 KH. Previous very high runoff and moderately rapid permeability changed to separate classes for areas with and without surface crust.\n9/99 KH.
