  "OVERVIEW": "The Hamburn series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils.  The Hamburn soils formed in alluvium and stream alluvium derived from sandstone and shale on low relief flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches.",
