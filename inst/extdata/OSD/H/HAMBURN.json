The Battlerock soils overlap the Hamburn soils and should be revaluated during the updates.  The Binton, Boyson, Lostwells, Toddler, and Youngston soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 52 degree F. and are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June.  Clayhole and Jocity soils have hues of 7.5YR and redder, in addition Jocity soils do not have accumulations of gypsum."

Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 6,000 feet.  Annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches, with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  These soils receive an additional 2 to 5 inches of run-on moisture from flooding.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."
