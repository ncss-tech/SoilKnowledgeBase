These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,225 to 3,078 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 450 mm, the mean annual temperature is 2 to 5 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."
