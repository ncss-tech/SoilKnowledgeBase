Henrietta soils formed in organic materials less than 41 cm (16 inches) thick and the underlying loamy and sandy sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 12.8 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 198 days. Elevation is 174 to 466 meters (570 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

Dixboro, Gilford, and Lamson soils are on higher elevations and lack the histic epipedon that is present in the Henrietta soils. Edwards, Houghton, and Palms soils are on the same landform position and have thicker histic layers than the Henrietta soils."
