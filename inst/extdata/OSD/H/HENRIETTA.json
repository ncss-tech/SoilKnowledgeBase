  "REVDATE": "08/2012",
  "STATES": "IN,MI,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Henrietta series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic materials less than 41 cm (16 inches) thick and the underlying loamy and sandy sediments. They are on glacial drainageways, lake plains, outwash plains, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
