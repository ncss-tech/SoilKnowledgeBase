  "OVERVIEW": "The Haire series is a member of the clayey, mixed, thermic family of Typic Haploxerults. Typically, Haire soils have gray and grayish brown, neutral or slightly acid, light clay loam A horizons, pale brown, strongly acid, clay B2t horizons, and pale yellow, strongly acid, gravelly clay loam C horizons.",

Soil between depths of about 4 and 12 inches usually is dry from May until November and usually is moist the rest of the year.\nThe A horizon is gray to dark grayish brown (10YR 5/1, 5/2, 4/1, 4/2). It is loam or light clay loam and in some pedons it is gravelly. It is neutral to moderately acid. Fine mottles are present in some pedons.\nThe B2t horizon is pale brown to dark grayish brown (10YR 6/3, 5/3, 7/3, 7/4, 6/4, 6/2, 5/3, 5/2, 4/2; 2.5Y 6/2) or olive gray (5Y 5/2). It is light clay, sandy clay or clay. This horizon has blocky, prismatic or columnar structure. It is moderately to strongly acid and has 20 to 35 percent base saturation.\nThe C horizon has dry value of 6 or 7 and is loam or clay loam with 2 to 75 percent rock fragments of various sizes. It is strongly or very strongly acid."

Cotati soils have an albic horizon and a mean soil temperature of 57 degrees to 58 degrees F. Huichica soils have a duripan. Rilarc and Sebastopol soils have a mean soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F. Santa Ynez soils have an argillic horizon that has more than 35 percent base saturation and more than 35 percent rock fragments. San Ysidro and Tierra soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent in the argillic horizon. Wright soils are wet, have mottles, and have more than 35 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Haire soils are on nearly level to moderately steep hills at elevations of 20 to 2,400 feet. They formed in terrace deposits and in part in residuum weathered from arkosic sandstone and granodiorite. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 45 inches. Average July temperature is about 70 degrees F., average January temperature is about 46 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees to 60 degrees F. The freeze-free season is 200 to 300 days."

Clear Lake soils have clay texture to the surface; the soil cracks and has slickensides. Santa Lucia and Sheridan soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick and lack an argillic horizon."
