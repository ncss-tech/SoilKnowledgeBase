  "OVERVIEW": "The Hobby series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on basalt plains, plateaus and mesas.  Hobby soils formed in loess and alluvium.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Tschamman soils are moderately deep to a duripan and deep to bedrock.  Bray soils have an ochric epipedon and an argillic horizon and do not crack.  On escarpments, Hobby soils are associated with rubble land and rock outcrop and Mchan soils.  Mchan soils have intersecting slickensides and a granular surface which partially fills soil cracks."
