Elevations range from 3,900 to 5,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. and the frost free period is 90 to 100 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  On plateaus and mesas, these are the Tschamman soils in broad drainageways and the Bray soils in concave positions.  Tschamman soils are moderately deep to a duripan and deep to bedrock.  Bray soils have an ochric epipedon and an argillic horizon and do not crack.  On escarpments, Hobby soils are associated with rubble land and rock outcrop and Mchan soils.  Mchan soils have intersecting slickensides and a granular surface which partially fills soil cracks."
