Ochric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 20 inches (Ap, Eg, and BE).\n2. Argillic horizon - from a depth of 20 to 62 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, 2Bt5, 2BC).\n3. Aquic conditions - from a depth of 13 to 80 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon CO-149 for characterization data on the typical pedon, sample numbers 27151-27163, from Columbiana County, Ohio; samples analyzed by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
