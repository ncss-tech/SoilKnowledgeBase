  "OVERVIEW": "The Harriman series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediment weathered from diatomite and lava rocks. Harriman soils are on basin terraces and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual  temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soils are usually dry and are dry at depths between 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 120 days in the four-month period following the summer solstice. Depth to soft bedrock is 40 to more than 60 inches. Mineralogy is mixed and includes considerable influence from diatomaceous material. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 45 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry. It has about 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent gravel.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe BCt or C horizon is at depths of 40 inches or more.  It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 35 percent gravel.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

All of these soils are usually moist and lack influence from diatomaceous earth. Banning soils are dry for 45 to 90 consecutive days and are somewhat poorly drained with mottles in the A and B horizons.  Coolbrith soils are moderately or slightly acid, are mottled and are saturated to within 25 to 40 inches of the surface during the spring.  Dotta soils are   slightly or moderately acid, and average 18 to 27 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Drews soils are  slightly acid or neutral.  Gorman soils have mean annual soil temperature of about 57 degrees F., 15 to 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand throughout profile and 20 to 28 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Haysum soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 59 degrees F.  Robinette soils have a silt loam loess cap and the top of the argillic horizon is below 40 inches.  Supan soils have a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 55 degrees F.  Van Dusen soils are high in quartz, mica, and feldspar.  Waha soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Wapinitia soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches."

The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.

Dodes soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have mollic epipedons 7 to 20 inches thick.  Eglirim soils are clayey-skeletal and have a mollic epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick.  Lorella soils have clayey-skeletal argillic horizons and are underlain by bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches. Drewsgap and Modoc soils have a duripan at 20 to 40 inches."
