  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  The control section has a weighted average clay content of 45 to 60 percent.   Unless cultivated there is gilgai micro-relief with microknolls 6 to 10 inches higher than microdepressions.  Typically, in areas with slopes of 3 percent or more, the knolls and depressions occur as low ridges and valleys that are parallel with the slope.  They form a tiger stripe pattern on aerial phopography.  The soil cracks when dry.  Cracks range from 1/2 an inch to about 2 inches wide and extend to a depth of more than 12 inches.  The cracks are open for 60 to 90 cumulative days during most years.  Slickensides and/or wedge shaped peds begin at a depth of 12 to 22 inches.  The amplitude of waviness of mollic to non-mollic colors ranges from a extreme depth of 6 inches on microknolls to 40 inches in microdepressions.  Some microknolls have spots (chimneys) that do not have mollic colored surfaces.  The redox masses in this soil are considered to be mainly relic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y with value of 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  If the chroma is less than 1.5 the horizon is less than 12 inches thick in more than 50 percent of the pedon.  Some pedons have a few masses in shades of brown in the lower part.  The texture is clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The matrix is dominantly effervesent, but ranges to noneffervescent and slightly alkaline in the upper part of some microdepressions.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, chroma of 2.  Redox masses in shades of brown, yellow or olive range from none to common.  The texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe Bkss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Redox masses in shades of brown, yellow or olive range from few to common.  Calcium carbonate threads, concretions, and masses range from 3 to 15 percent.\nThe BCss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redox masses in shades of brown, yellow, or gray range from few to common.  Calcium carbonate concretions and masses ranges from about 1 to 10 percent.  Gypsum crystals are in the lower part of some pedons."

Eastham, Garner, and Tinn soils have an A horizon with chroma of 1 to a depth of more than 12 inches.  In addition the Tinn soils are on flood plains.  Heiden soils are in the ustic moisture regime and have a solum 40 to 65 inches thick."

The soil formed in clayey alluvial sediments.  Slopes range from 2 to 5 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 46 inches and the Thornwaite P-E index ranges from 66 to 70.  The elevation ranges from 175 to 225 feet above sea level.  Frost free days range from 230 to 260."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for pasture and hayland. Most areas have been cultivated in the past but now are used for pasture.  Bermudagrass and kleingrass are adapted and are grown on this soil.  Some areas are cultivated to grain sorghum or small grain.  Native grasses include bluestems, Indiangrass, buffalograss, tridens, and threeawn.  There are a few scattered mesquite in some areas."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Formerly included in the Heiden or Ferris series. This soil would be classified in an aquic subgroup if the mottles at a depth of 17 inches reflect the present moisture system.  However, these mottles are considered relic because they have sharp boundaries between colors and the drainage, slope, position, use, and managmennt indicate wetness is not a problem.  Classification changed from Typic Chromuderts to Typic Hapluderts in February, 1994 based on Issue 16 of  Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 17 inches (the Ap, A and Bss horizons).\nCambic horizon - 17 to 80 inches (Bss, Bkss, and BCss horizons).\nVertisol feature - cracks when dry; and intersecting slickensides from 17 to 80 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: TAMU data S90-TX-225-3.\nSOIL INTERPRETATION RECORD NUMBER:  TX1231\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
