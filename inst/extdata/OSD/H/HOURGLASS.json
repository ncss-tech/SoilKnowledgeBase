  "OVERVIEW": "The Hourglass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and limestone, but also from mixed sources. Hourglass soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches.",

(Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 11 to 31 inches (the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon)\nThe superactive CEC activity class is presumed for this series based on the general trend indicated by lab data throughout this region.\nThe 02/1999 revision moves the type location to the Animas-Dolores Soil Survey Area, Colorado from Summit County, Utah.  This series is currently not correlated in Utah.  The range in characteristics and geographic setting is extensively revised to include only soils as mapped in Colorado, in MLRA 48A.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Series classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
