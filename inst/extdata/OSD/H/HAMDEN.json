Attoyac, Elrose, and Prue soils lack wetness mottles within 30 inches of the soil surface.  Bernaldo, Bernow, and Freestone soils have more than 5 percent skeletons in the argillic horizon.  Falkner, Nesbitt, and Vian\nsoils have fine-silty control sections.  Freest soils have an apparent water table between 1.5 and 2.5 feet of the soil surface\nand they occur in areas of higher mean annual precipitation.  Goldsboro, Kullit, Quitman, Rehobeth, Sawyer, and Wrightsboro\nsoils have base saturation less than 35 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  Katy soils have prismatic\nstructure and coatings on prism faces in lower part of the\nargillic horizon.  Shuster, Stigler, and Tamaha soils have fine control sections."
