  "OVERVIEW": "The Hajisho series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone over residuum weathered from limestone.  Hajisho soils are on summits of plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
