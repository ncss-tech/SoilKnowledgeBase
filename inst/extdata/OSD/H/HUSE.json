    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 6 to 18 inches, depth to bedrock 8 to 22 inches, and mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F.  The A11 horizon is dry most summers for more than 60 consecutive days.  The A horizon colors dry are in 7.5YR, 5YR and 2.5YR hues and have values of 3 and 4.  Moist hues are 5YR and 2.5YR and 10R with values of 2 and 3.  Chromas are 3 to 6 dry and 2 to 4 moist. Texture ranges from stony clay and silty clay to stony heavy clay loam; structure from strong to medium granular, and reaction from slightly acid to neutral.  The B2 horizons are strong brown dry and dark reddish brown to reddish brown when moist.  Hues are 7.5YR, 5YR and 2.5YR with values of 4 and 5 dry and 3 and 4 moist.  Chromas are 6 dry and 4 moist.  The B2 horizons have slightly finer textures than the A horizons and have weaker structure."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Huse soils occur on gently to steeply sloping uplands under shrub and conifer vegetation.  They formed in weathered material from peridotite and similar rocks.  Elevations are about 1,500 to 2,500 feet.  The climate is humid mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 50 to 100 inches, with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., average January temperature about 40 degrees F., and average July temperature about 65 degrees F."
