  "OVERVIEW": "The Hendap series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks and calcareous loess.  Hendap soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
