Lawrenceville and Zanesville soils have a lithic contact in the series control section. Omulga and Otwell soils have average more than 28 percent clay in some subhorizon within the lower part of the series control section. Sadler soils have a glossic horizon in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hosmer soils are commonly on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of loess hills. Hosmer soils formed in either silty loess, or silty loess and the underlying \"gritty\" loess which has a higher sand content. The slope gradient is commonly 2 to 12 percent, but ranges from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1168 mm (35 to 46 inches). The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F).  Frost-free period ranges from 170 to 210 days. Elevation ranges from 104 to 311 meters (340 to 1020 feet) above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Stoy soils are on nearly level to gently rolling summits. The poorly drained Weir soils are on flats."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/sec) above the fragipan and low to moderately high (0.07 to 1.41 micrometers/sec) in and below the fragipan. Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2.0 inches per hour) above the fragipan and slow or very slow in and below the fragipan. The potential for surface water runoff is medium to very high."
