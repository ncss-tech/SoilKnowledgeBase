  "OVERVIEW": "The Hynes series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources. They are on terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
