    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to more than 60 inches.  When bedrock is present it is paralithic.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  Base saturation throughout the solum is 75 to 95 percent by sum of bases.  The solum is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 thru 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy silt loam, ashy loam or ashy silty clay loam.  The change in texture to the argillic horizon is abrupt with an absolute increase in clay of 15 to 20 percent.  It is 7 to 14 inches thick and has 15 to 40 percent glass and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 0.2 to 0.5 percent.  It has 0 to 40 percent gravel, 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.\nSome pedons have a 3 to 8 inch thick Bw horizon consisting of clay loam or silty clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, moist value of 2 or 3 in the upper part, 3 or 4 in the lower part and dry value of 4 or 5 in the upper part and 5 through 7 in the lower part.  It is clay or silty clay and has 45 to 60 percent clay.  It has weak or moderate prismatic structure parting to moderate or strong subangular or angular blocky.  It has 0 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hankins soils are on hills at elevations of from 2,500 to 5,200 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 70 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt, rhyolite and tuff with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is subhumid with a mean annual precipitation of 16 to 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 58 to 62 degrees F, and mean January temperature is 27 to 32 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 20 to 90 days."
