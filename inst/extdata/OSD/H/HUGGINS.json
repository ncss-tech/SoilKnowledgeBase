  "OVERVIEW": "The Huggins series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from siltstone on uplands.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 9 to 20 inches in thickness and extends into the Bt horizon.  Depth to bedrock typically is 20 to 30 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay averaging from 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  The lower part of the Bt horizon contains 15 to 35 percent by volume fragments of hard siltstone.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam and contains 35 to 80 percent by volume fragments of hard siltstone.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have C horizon.  The underlying siltstone bedrock consists of strata of different hardness.  Some strata do not have carbonate."

Ashfork and Chapin soils have a calcic horizon.  Blackpipe soils have less coarse fragments in the lower Bt and Bk horizons and have carbonate above a depth of 25 inches.  Boneek, Collbran, Kube, Loma, Nuncho, Nunn, Rednun, Richfield, Ryus, Savo, Showlow, Sofia, Standley, and Torreon are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock. Boquillas soils have a redder hue in the Bt horizon.  Emigrant, Leyden, and Querc soils have more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Thunderbird soils have more clay in the A horizon and formed in material weathered from basalt or pyroclastics.  Wormser soils have less coarse fragments in the lower part of the solum."
