The first lithologic discontinuity represents a change in parent material from alluvium deposited by local drainageways to Missoula Flood sediment.\n11/2017--This official series description was updated according to SSR01 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 11/2017). The classification was changed from Typic Argialbolls to Xeric Argialbolls based on recognition of a period of dryness following the summer solstice that has been consistently recognized throughout the Willamette Valley. The twelfth edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy was used for this reclassification. The competing series were updated also. Most of the other changes were in formatting.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--sample number S96OR-043-002, National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE; 2/1999; type location user site ID 1966OR047006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
