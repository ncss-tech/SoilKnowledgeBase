  "OVERVIEW": "The Hartbench series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in outwash derived from granitic rocks.  These soils are on outwash fans and fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 370 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
