  "OVERVIEW": "The Hatrock series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from rhyolite and mixed with volcanic ash.  Hatrock soils are on north-facing buttes and have slopes of  12 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
