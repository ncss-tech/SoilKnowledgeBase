The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 30 inches.  The particle-size control section has 10 to 15 percent field estimates clay and averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The solum has 15 to 25 percent phosphate retention, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.4 to 0.8 percent and 30 to 50 percent lass and glass coated aggregate.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

These soils formed in colluvium derived from rhyolite and mixed with volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
