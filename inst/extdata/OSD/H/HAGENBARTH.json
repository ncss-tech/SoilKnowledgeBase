  "OVERVIEW": "The Hagenbarth series consists of and very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from quartzite, basalt, and tuff.  Hagenbarth soils are on mountains and hills and have slopes of 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 580 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
