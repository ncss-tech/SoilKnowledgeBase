Typically, the A horizon has distinct high bulk density, and a large amount of heavy minerals; in some places these are lacking. The A horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, moist value of 2 through 4, and moist chroma of 3 through 6."

These soils formed in volcanic ash and residuum weathered from basic igneous rocks. Mean annual rainfall is 30 to 60 inches. Annual pan evaporation is 65 to 75 inches. Mean annual temperature is 67 to 71 degrees F., mean January temperature is 68 degrees F, and mean July temperature is 72 degrees F."

Kahanui soils have a discontinuous ironstone sheet and 7.5YR or yellower hue throughout. Naiwa soils have 2.5YR through 10R hue throughout the solum, and silt loam and loam textures and weak structure throughout the B horizon. Olelo soils have 2.5YR through 10R hue throughout the argillic horizon and have continuous moderately thick clay films in the lower part of the\nargillic horizon."
