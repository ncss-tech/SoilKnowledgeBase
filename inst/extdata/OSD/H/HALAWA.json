  "OVERVIEW": "The Halawa series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash and basic igneous rock. Halawa soils are on gently sloping to very steep, low mountain slopes. The mean annual rainfall is about 1,143 millimeters (45 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 21 degrees C. (69 degrees F.)",
