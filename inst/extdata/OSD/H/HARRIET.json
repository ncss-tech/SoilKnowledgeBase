  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically, the soil has carbonates and visible salt or gypsum crystals at depths of 4 to 11 inches but they are throughout the soil in some pedons.  Some pedons have a dark A horizon 1 to 2 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y  or is neutral, value of 2 to 5 moist and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It is absent in some cultivated pedons.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 4 moist and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is dominantly clay loam or silty clay loam but the range includes silty clay and clay.  It averages between 35 and 50 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have BC, Bkg, Bky, or Bkz horizons.  The B horizon has redoximorphic features in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or 5GY, value of 3 to 5 moist and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have a chroma of 4 below a depth of 40 inches.  The C horizon typically is stratified and has textures ranging from very fine sandy loam to clay.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Strata of coarser materials are below a depth of 30 inches in some pedons.  Some pedons have faint to prominent redoximorphic features in the C horizon.  Some pedons have salts and gypsum in the C horizon."

Heil soils do not have salts or carbonates within depths of 12 inches and they are absent in the A, E and upper Btn horizons.  Ranslo soils have combined A and E horizons of more than 5 inches thick.  Ryan soils average 50 to 60 percent clay in the Btn horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harriet soils are on level and nearly level, low lying flats, and low terraces and bottom lands along streams.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous alluvium.  The mean annual air temperature is 34 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches.  Most of the precipitation is in the spring and summer."

None of these soils, except Ranslo, have natric horizons and all, except Lamoure and Ranslo soils, are better drained. Farland, Lehr, Savage and Shambo soils are adjacent to Harriet soils on low terraces.  Havrelon, Korchea, Lamoure, La Prairie, Magnus, Ranslo, Straw and Velva soils are adjacent to Harriet soils on flood plains and bottom lands."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 18 inches (E, Btn1, and Btn2 horizons); natric horizon - the zone from 2 to 18 inches (Btn and Btnz horizons).\nPlacement of the Harriet soils with the Aquolls seems most appropriate although they do not always meet the morphological requirements of the Aquolls (i.e., redoximorphic features and/or low chroma).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
