Doger soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick. Dorrance soils have free carbonates at depths of less than 40 inches. Dunday soils have moist color value of less than 3.5 at depth of 20 inches or less. Meadin soils contain more than 15 percent gravel in the particle size control section. Pivot soils are underlain by sand and gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in recent alluvium derived chiefly from sandstone and limestone.  The climate is cool continental.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees to 54 degrees F.  The average January temperature is about 35 degrees and the average July temperature is about 70 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 100 to 140 days.  They receive run-on water from slopes above."
