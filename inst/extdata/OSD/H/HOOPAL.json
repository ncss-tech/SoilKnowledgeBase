The exchangeable sodium exceeds 15 percent to a depth of 20 inches and decreases below with increasing depth.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 50 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 62 to 65 degrees F.  Depth to duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or loam and averages 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.\nThe duripan is massive or platy and weakly to strongly cemented.\nThe C2 horizon is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam."
