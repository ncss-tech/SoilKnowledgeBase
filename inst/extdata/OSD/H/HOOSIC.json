  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 36 inches. Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 10 to 35 percent by volume in the A horizons, 20 to 55 percent in the B horizon, and 35 to 75 percent in the 2C horizon. Cobblestones and flagstones make up as much as 15 percent of the solum and up to 20 percent of the substratum. Reaction unless limed, is very strongly acid or strongly acid above 30 inches, and ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid below 30 inches except in some pedons it increases to mildly alkaline below depths of 7 feet.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from sandy loam to silt loam. It has weak or moderate, medium or fine granular structure, some pedons range to subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe B horizons have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. They have textures ranging from coarse sandy loam to loam in the fine earth fraction above depths of 10 to 25 inches and textures of loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand in the fine earth fraction below these depths. They have very weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistance is friable or very friable. Some subhorizons are single grained and loose. Some pedons have a 2BC horizon with color and textures similar to the 2C horizon.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. They are stratified loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, or sand in the fine earth fraction. They are single grained and loose."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Gloucester series are in the same family. Gloucester soils lack stratified 2C horizons. The Brandywine series may be in the same family once it is updated to the 8th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Brandywine soils lack stratified 2C horizons.\nThe Alton, Bonaparte, Chenango, Croton, Hartford, Hinckley, Juno, Manchester, Merrimac, Otisville, Quonset, Speelyai, Tunkhannock and Warwick series are similar soils in related families. Alton soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section, and have more than 60 percent base saturation within 30 inches. Bonaparte, Hinckley, Juno, Manchester, Otisville, Quonset, and Speelyai soils lack cambic horizons. Chenango, Tunkhannock and Warwick soils have loamy skeletal particle-size control sections. Croton soils have more than 60 percent base saturation within 30 inches. Hartford and Merrimac soils have sandy particle size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hoosic soils are nearly level to undulating soils on glacial outwash plains and valley trains and related terraces, kames, eskers, and water sorted parts of moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The soils formed I water-sorted sandy and gravelly material containing varying proportions of sandstone, shale, phyllite and slate. Mean annual precipation ranges from 30 to 50 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F.; mean annual frost free period ranges from 135 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 100 to 1100 feet above sea level."

Atherton soils are poorly to very poorly drained and are associated in low areas. Braceville soils have a fragipan and are not as well drained. Castile soils are moderately well drained. Fredon soils are somewhat poorly to poorly drained. Halsey soils are very poorly drained and are in nearby depressions. Oakville soils are dominated by fine sand throughout and occur in less gravelly deposits."
