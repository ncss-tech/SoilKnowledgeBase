  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 68 degrees F.  The soil is saturated and has a temporary water table for six months or more during most years unless artificially drained.  The soil is calcareous throughout, but lacks sufficient secondary carbonates to have a calcic horizon.  In uncultivated areas some pedons have a thin 0 horizon less than 4 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The lower part of the A horizon has faint to prominent mottles with hues of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Some pedons have a Bg horizon.\nThe particle-size control section has matrix of 5Y through 5BG and is mottled throughout.  It is predominantly clay loam, but is stratified with lenses 1 to 12 inches thick that range from silty clay loam to fine sand.  The clay content averages 18 to 35 percent.\nThe substratum, or C horizon, has hue of 5Y through 5BG, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Below a depth of about 3 feet, a massive, silty, or clayey layer, which restricts water movement, is commonly present but not required."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bigsandy (MT) and Mckeen (ND) series.  Bigsandy soils lack lithologic discontinuity in the profile and are at elevations of 2,600 to 4,600 feet.  Mckeen soils lack lithologic discontinuity in the profile and are at low elevations along the Missouri River."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hagga soils are on narrow valley bottoms and concave depressions on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in mixed alluvial deposits weathered from calcareous sandstone, marlstone, and shale.  The soils are in a cool, semiarid climate.  Annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 18 inches.  In Utah, annual precipitation is as low as 10 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 21 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F.   The average annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 8,200 feet.  The frost-free season is about 60 to 105 days."

Glendive and Havre soils are well drained and Glendive soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  Hanly soils are somewhat excessively drained and have a sandy particle-size control section."

Native vegetation is mainly sedges, rushes, and water-tolerant grasses.   Broadleaf sedges and Carexs grow in the more poorly drained areas."
