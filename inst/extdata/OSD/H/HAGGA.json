  "OVERVIEW": "The Hagga series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium weathered from calcareous sedimentary bedrock.  Hagga soils are on narrow valley bottoms and flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 68 degrees F.  The soil is saturated and has a temporary water table for six months or more during most years unless artificially drained.  The soil is calcareous throughout, but lacks sufficient secondary carbonates to have a calcic horizon.  In uncultivated areas some pedons have a thin 0 horizon less than 4 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The lower part of the A horizon has faint to prominent mottles with hues of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Some pedons have a Bg horizon.\nThe particle-size control section has matrix of 5Y through 5BG and is mottled throughout.  It is predominantly clay loam, but is stratified with lenses 1 to 12 inches thick that range from silty clay loam to fine sand.  The clay content averages 18 to 35 percent.\nThe substratum, or C horizon, has hue of 5Y through 5BG, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Below a depth of about 3 feet, a massive, silty, or clayey layer, which restricts water movement, is commonly present but not required."

The soil formed in mixed alluvial deposits weathered from calcareous sandstone, marlstone, and shale.  The soils are in a cool, semiarid climate.  Annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 18 inches.  In Utah, annual precipitation is as low as 10 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 21 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F.   The average annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 8,200 feet.  The frost-free season is about 60 to 105 days."
