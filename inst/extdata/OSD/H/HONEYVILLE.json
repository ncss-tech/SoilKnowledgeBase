  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is about 50 degrees  F. and the mean summer soil temperature is about 72 degrees F. The soils are usually moist; they are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than one-half of the time the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. (41 degrees F.). The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months.\nThe mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and the solum is 19 to 36 inches thick. The control section is silty clay loam, averaging about 35 to 40 percent clay. These soils have a fluctuating water table at depths of 40 to more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly to strongly alkaline and slightly to moderately calcareous.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silty clay loam or silty clay. It is slightly to strongly alkaline and moderately to strongly calcareous.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It has fine, faint to prominent mottles at depths of 30 inches or more. It is silty clay to silty clay loam. It is strongly to very strongly alkaline."

Fridlo soils have natric horizons with 24 to 32 percent clay. Nibley soils have argillic horizons and have mottles with chroma of 2 within 30 inches or have water table within 40 inches for 90 days or more when undrained.

The parent materials are fine and moderately fine textured lacustrine deposits. The climate is dry subhumid with a mean annual temperature of 48 degrees F., and a mean summer temperature of 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 140 days. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches."
