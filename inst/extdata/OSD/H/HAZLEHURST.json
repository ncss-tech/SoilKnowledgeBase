  "OVERVIEW": "The Hazlehurst series consists of somewhat poorly drained, nearly level soils on uplands of the Coastal Plains.  These soils have grayish loamy sand A and E horizons, loamy B horizons and firm, brittle Bx horizons containing more than 5 percent plinthite.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 67 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 49 inches.",

The soil moisture regime has features like the Aeric Paleaquults.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 inches (Ap, E horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from approximately 8 to 13 inches (E horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 13 to 63 inches (Btv, Btgv, Btvx1, Btvx2, Btvx3).\nFragic feature - the zone with 10 to 40 percent dense and brittle properties from approximately 24 to 63 inches (Btvx1, Btvx2, Btvx3 horizons).\nPlinthic feature - the zone with 5 percent or more plinthite from approximately 13 to 63 inches (Btv, Btgv, Btvx1, Btvx2, Btvx3 horizons)."
