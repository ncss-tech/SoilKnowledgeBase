All horizons are very strongly acid or strongly acid except for surface layers that have been limed.  Ironstone nodules range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and E horizons, 2 to 10 percent in the Btv horizons and 7 to 30 percent in the Btvx horizons. Clay content of the control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent and silt content is less than 20 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3 or 4.  It is loamy sand or sand.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5, 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 or 3; or it is neutral with value of 5, 6 or 7.  It is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bt1 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3, 4 or 6.  Mottles are few to many in shades of gray, yellow, brown and red.  Plinthite is 0 to 4 percent.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btv horizon has hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5, 6 or 7 and chroma of 3, 4 or 6 in the upper part and 1 through 6 below, or it is neutral with value of 5, 6 or 7.  Mottles are few to many in shades of gray, yellow, brown and red.  Plinthite is 5 to 20 percent.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btgv horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5, 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5, 6 or 7.  Mottles are common or many in shades of gray, yellow, brown or red.  Plinthite is 5 to 20 percent.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btvx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5, 6 or 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 with common or many mottles in shades of gray, yellow, brown or red; or it is mottled in shades of gray, yellow, brown or red.  This horizon has dense and brittle properties in 10 to 40 percent by volume, mostly in materials in shade of brown and red that has platy structure.  It is sandy clay loam or loam, clay loam or loam."

Clarendon and Kirbyville soils do not have dense properties.  Saucier and Robertsdale soils have more than 20 percent silt in the control section.  Alapaha, Ellabelle, and Surrency soils have an arenic epipedon.  Ardilla soils have a Btx horizon with 40 to 60 percent brittle properties.  Atmore and Pansey soils are gleyed immediately below the A horizon.  Basin, Escambia and Stough soils have a coarse-loamy control section.  Lynchburg soils do not have plinthite.  Mashulaville soils do not have matrix chromas of 3 or more and do not have plinthite."
