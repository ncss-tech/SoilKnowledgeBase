  "OVERVIEW": "The Hyte series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from acid and basic igneous rocks.  Hyte soils are on hills and mountains.   Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches (30 cm) and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.(12 degrees C.)",
