Devaul soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Elaero soils average 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have rock fragments that are granitic rocks, and have paralithic material of weathered granitic rock in the series control section. Glidski, Heechee, Holmes, Howcan, Longday, Pequop, and Wambolt soils are very deep.  Horrocks soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Hoskin, Suak, Valmar, and Vitale soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Squawtip soils average 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Heenlake soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,655 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 600 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 46 cm (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 56 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 56 cm to underlying soft bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 56 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid Typic Argixerolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
