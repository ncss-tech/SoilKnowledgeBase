  "OVERVIEW": "The Haledon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils in low positions on undulating uplands. They formed in glacial till. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the fragipan and very slow or slow in in the fragipan and densic materials. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1258 mm.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 102 to 152 cm.  Depth to the fragipan is 61 to 90 cm.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 2 m.  Rock fragments of mostly gravel, cobbles, and stones of basalt, shale, sandstone and gneiss range from 5 to 25 percent in the solum and from 15 to 35 percent in the substratum. Mineralogy is dominated by quartz, feldspar, amphibole and mica. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum, from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and upper part of the C horizon, and from moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the C horizon.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2. The in lieu texture is commonly highly decomposed plant material but the range includes slightly to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Value is 6 or more when dry.  Some pedons have an A horizon up to 13 cm thick.  It has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam or  silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture has the same range as the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR and value of 4 to 8. Chroma ranges from 3 to 6 in the upper part of the B and from 1 to 6 in the lower part.  Redoximorphic features are few to common in the upper part and range to many in the lower part.  Low chroma redoximorphic features are within the top 25 cm of the Bt horizon.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bx or Btx horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6, or it is mottled or variegated with these and other colors.  Black stains are in most pedons.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, thick or very thick platy or the horizons are massive.  Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe Cd horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  High and low chroma redoximorphic features and black stains are in most pedons.  Texture ranges from loam to sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction."

Wethersfield and Wurtsboro soils do not have argillic horizons."

The soils developed in coarse textured glacial till composed primarily of basalt, red sandstone and shale, and granitic gneiss with lesser amounts of quartzite and gray sandstone and shale.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 122 cm.  The mean annual temperature commonly ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C but the range includes up to 13 degrees C in or near urban areas.  The frost-free days range from 140 to 160 days."

A perched high water table is within 30 cm of the surface in the late winter and early spring of most years, and following periods of extended rainfall.  Lateral seepage is common, particularly at slope breaks."
