The Shinbone series is in a closely related family.  Alonzville, Bailegap, Hambrook, Jefferson, Keener, Lonewood, Marr, Riney, Sassafrass, Shinbone, and Sunnyside soils are more than 40 inches to paralithic or lithic contact. Beersheba and Gunstock soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Lily, McCamy, and Raftville soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harmiller soils are on ridges and side slopes of low and intermediate mountains, commonly where there is a linear or convex surface. Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from about 1,500 to 4,500 feet. Harmiller soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part, weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as feldspathic metasandstone, metasiltstone, and phyllite.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 46 to 57 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from about 100 to 150 days, and the average annual rainfall ranges from about 48 to 64 inches."

Cataska, Soco, and Sylco soils are typically on steeper parts of nearby landforms. Cataska soils 10 to 20 inches to a paralithic contact. Soco soils have mixed mineralogy and a cambic horizon. Sylco soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Chestoa and Jeffrey soils are on adjacent landscapes with cool aspects, are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact. Chestoa soils have siliceous mineralogy and Jeffrey soils have mixed mineralogy. Lostcove, Spivey, and Whiteoak soils are on colluvial landscapes. They are very deep to bedrock. Marbleyard soils are loamy-skeletal and soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches below the soil surface. McCamy soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches below the soil surface."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soils now included with the Harmiller series were previously mapped with Junaluska soils. Junaluska soils have an argillic horizon with hue that is dominantly 2.5YR or 5YR and have mixed mineralogy. The clay content of the particle-size control section for Harmiller soils averages about 18 percent. The total silt content ranges from about 30 to 50 percent. The fine silt fraction averages about 30 percent and ranges from about 20 to 40 percent. According to engineering index data, a large portion of the silt content is very fine silt.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 4 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 4 to 22 inches (Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact - weathered bedrock contact at 31 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nSIR = NC0244 MLRA = 130\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference data is available from the North Carolina State University Soils Department, Raleigh, NC; pedon number S92NC-121-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
