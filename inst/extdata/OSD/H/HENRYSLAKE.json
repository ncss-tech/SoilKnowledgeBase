  "OVERVIEW": "The Henryslake series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium on outwash plains.  Dominant vegetation is grasses and sedges.  Permeability is moderately slow. Average annual precipitation is about 27 inches.  Average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 45 days.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.",

Average annual temperature ranges from 36 to 40 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.  Moisture is dominantly in the form of snow.  A minor amount falls as rain during the months of May through September."

Fourme soils are on drier sites lacking a water table and redox features.  Raynoldson soils are on well drained outwash plains and are pachic, but have no argillic horizons.  Tepete soils are organic soils and occur in peat bogs between bodies of water and well drained soils."
