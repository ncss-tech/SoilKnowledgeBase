The water table is apparent and does not drop below two feet at any time during the year.  Elevations range from 6,300 to 6,600 feet.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 36 to 40 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days.  Moisture is dominantly in the form of snow.  A minor amount falls as rain during the months of May through September."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bootjack, Fourme, Raynoldson, Shotgun, and Tepete soils.  Bootjack soils are on adjacent wet sites and lack a mollic epipedon.  Fourme soils are on drier sites lacking a water table and redox features.  Raynoldson soils are on well drained outwash plains and are pachic, but have no argillic horizons.  Tepete soils are organic soils and occur in peat bogs between bodies of water and well drained soils."
