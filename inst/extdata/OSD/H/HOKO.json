The soils are usually moist and have a udic soil moisture regime. The solum and depth to cemented till is 20 to 40 inches. The solum has andic soil properties throughout with moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.90 g/cc, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron is 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention is 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention is 25 to 35 percent on air dried samples. The particle-size control section has 35 to 70 percent rounded rock fragments. Acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent. The solum has 2 to 3 cmol/kg of aluminum. Depth to redox concentrations is 8 to 20 inches.\nThe A and BA horizons has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, have value of 2 to 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma 2 to 4 moist and dry. It has 10 to 20 percent organic matter. It is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is very gravelly medial silt loam, very gravelly and extremely gravelly medial loam, very gravelly medial silty clay loam or very gravelly medial clay loam. It has 2 to 10 percent organic matter with less than 7 percent below 10 inches. It is very strongly or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bsm horizon has hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.

The soils formed in alpine glacial till over cemented basal till derived from sandstone, shale, metamorphosed slate, phyllites, and graywacke. These soils occur in a wet cool marine climate having an annual precipitation of 90 to 170 inches; average summer temperature is 59 degrees F.; average winter temperature is 40 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 220 days."
