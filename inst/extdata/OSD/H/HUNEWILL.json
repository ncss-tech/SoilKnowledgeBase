  "OVERVIEW": "The Hunewill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Hunewill soils are on stream terraces, fan remnants, ballenas, and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Basket and Chiefrange soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September due to convection storms. Breko soils are effervescent to the surface and have mean annual soil temperature of 13 to 15 degrees C.  Cowgil soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 76 cm.  Drino, Lithgow, and Schader soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Hefed soils have C horizons with very cobbly textures under the argillic horizon.  Huilepass soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative due to summer convection storms.  Jungo soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have horizons with secondary carbonates at depths of 8 to 20 cm from the soil surface, and have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 100 to more than 50 cm.
