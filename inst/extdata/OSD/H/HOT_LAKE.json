Redox features with chroma of 2 or less are within 30 inches of the surface. The solum is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and the diatomaceous sediments are slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  The 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction makes up 50 to 80 percent of the less than 2.0 mm fine-earth fraction throughout the soil.  Moist bulk density is 0.90 to 1.0 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has 15-bar moisture of 15 to 25 percent based on an air-dried sample and has an estimated phosphate retention of more than 25 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 0.4 percent.\nThe Bk and C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is silt loam and averages 5 to 17 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist. It is platy or massive and is weakly calcareous or noncalcareous. It is diatomaceous silt and averages more than 70 percent silt and 3 to 10 percent clay."

These soils formed from volcanic ash, loess and mixed lacustrine materials in the upper part over mixed volcanic ash and diatomaceous sediments.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 20 inches.   The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."
