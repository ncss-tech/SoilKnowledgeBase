  "OVERVIEW": "The Hot Lake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained silt loam soils that formed in volcanic ash and loess over diatomaceous sediments. Hot Lake soils are on old lake basins and valley floors and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Redox features with chroma of 2 or less are within 30 inches of the surface. The solum is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and the diatomaceous sediments are slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  The 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction makes up 50 to 80 percent of the less than 2.0 mm fine-earth fraction throughout the soil.  Moist bulk density is 0.90 to 1.0 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has 15-bar moisture of 15 to 25 percent based on an air-dried sample and has an estimated phosphate retention of more than 25 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 0.4 percent.\nThe Bk and C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is silt loam and averages 5 to 17 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist. It is platy or massive and is weakly calcareous or noncalcareous. It is diatomaceous silt and averages more than 70 percent silt and 3 to 10 percent clay."
