  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: from 5 to 40 inches (Btn, Btnz, Bnz, and upper part of 2C horizon)\nOchric epipedon and albic horizon: from 0 to 5 inches (E horizon)\nNatric horizon: from 5 to 32 inches (Btn and Btnz horizons)\nStrongly contrasting particle-size class: at 32 inches. The sandy clay loam Bnz is assumed to have less than 50 percent fine sand and coarser sand; the weighted average noncarbonate clay in the upper part of the PSCS is assumed greater than 18 percent.\nThe 09/2008 revison changed the particle-size family from clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal to fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal, with the accompanying change of the mineralogy class from smectitic to mixed.\nThe parent material is more accurately defined as being derived from mixed sources (igneous and metamorphic rock); the original concept was being derived from volcanic rock, jwb, 4/2009\nThis series has historically beeen recognized with a highly variable depth to water table- within 4 feet to greater than 6 feet. The 12/2011 revision provisionally retains the original water table criterion, but it is likely the central concept of this series will be revised to have no saturation within the series control section (150 cm). Drainage class would then be well drained only. More field investigation will be required before this change can definitely be made.\nTaxonomy version: Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
