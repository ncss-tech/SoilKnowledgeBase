Bly soils have average summer soil temperature cooler than 17 degrees C.  Carey Lake soils have BC and 2C horizons with mottles.  Dunford and Mahogan soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Hades soils have average annual soil temperatures of 4 to 6 degrees C. Krueger soils are mildly alkaline in the Bt horizon.  Lagnaf soils have more than 20 percent gravel in the upper 50 cm of the argillic.  Marotz soils have buried argillic horizons formed in contrasting material and average summer soil temperature less than 17 degrees C.  Nagle soils are calcareous above 100 cm.  Moffspring soils have argillic horizons 13 to 25 cm thick.  Sag soils have 40 to 60 percent clay and 50 to 90 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon (discontinuity). Strom soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Tusk soils are neutral to mildly alkaline and the lower argillic has 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 8 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and loess from volcanoclastic material.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 330 to 410 mm, and average annual temperature ranges from 5 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 65 to 95 days."
