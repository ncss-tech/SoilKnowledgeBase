  "OVERVIEW": "The Hathaway series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources.  Hathaway soils are on fan remnants and have dominant slopes of 10 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

Slopes are dominantly 10 to 40 percent, and range from 2 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in fan alluvium from mixed sources of limestone, rhyolite, granite, dacite, andesite, tuff, quartzite, sandstone, and shale.  Hathaway soils occur in warm, semiarid, continental climate.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 66 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  About 55 percent of the precipitation occurs during July, August, and September; 35 percent in December and January.  The frost-free period is 160 to 240 days."
