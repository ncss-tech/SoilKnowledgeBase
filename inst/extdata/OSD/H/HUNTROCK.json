  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 50 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47degrees F. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Hues are 10YR or 7.5YR. Thickness of the ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches. The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry. It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. It contains 40 to 60 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate. Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.40 to 1.0 percent. It is slightly or moderately smeary. The moist bulk density is 0.85 to 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe 2Bwb horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry. It is extremely gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly silty clay loam, extremely cobbly clay loam, or extremely cobbly silty clay loam. Field estimated clay is 27 to 35 percent. It has 15 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 50 percent cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Huntrock soils are on moderately steep to steep south side slopes of mountains. Elevation is 3,800 to 7,200 feet. Slopes are 12 to 75 percent. The soil is formed in colluvium derived dominantly from argillite with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 45 to 90 days."
