  "OVERVIEW": "The Hingham series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian, glaciolacustrine, or alluvium deposits.  These soils are on till plains and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
