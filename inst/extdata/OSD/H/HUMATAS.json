  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Humatas series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on side slopes and ridges of strongly dissected uplands.  They formed in clayey and loamy material that weathered from igneous rocks. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 78 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.",
