Consumo soils are moderately deep to saprolite.  Daguey soils have more clay in the control section and are Oxisols.  The somewhat poorly drained Lares soils are on terraces at lower elevations.  Los Guineos soils are on higher positions, are isothermic, have more clay in the control section, and are Oxisols.  Zarzal soils have more clay in the control section and are Oxisols."
