  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry continuously for 45 to 70 days during the summer between depths of 4 and 12 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 52 degrees F. Depth to weathered bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more. Rock fragments commonly are absent in the upper 40 inches of the soil but in some pedons they range to 15 percent and up to 35 percent below a depth of 40 inches. The soils are moderately acid or strongly acid in the upper part and strongly acid or very strongly acid in the lower part.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry. It has weak or moderate granular or fine or very fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam and has 25 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. It has weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure."
