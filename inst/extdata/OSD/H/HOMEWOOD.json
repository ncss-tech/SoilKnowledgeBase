  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Homewood soils are on till plains and till-covered sandstone hills. Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent. The soils formed in Illinoian age till and in a thin mantle of loess in some areas. Some pedons extend into residual parent materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 11 degrees C (49 to 52 degrees F). Elevation is 320 to 351 meters (1050 to 1150 feet) above mean sea level."

Chili, Conotton, Negley, and Parke soils are on nearby terraces. Brownsville and Dekalb soils are on siltstone and sandstone hills that do not have a mantle of till. Loudonville and Mechanicsburg soils are on till covered sandstone hills where bedrock is at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches), or more than 102 cm (40 inches), respectively. The somewhat poorly drained Gresham soils and moderately well drained Titusville soils are in a toposequence with Homewood soils. They are on the lower parts of some slopes or in concave landscape positions. Westmoreland soils are in similar landscape positions but are formed in residuum."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. In undisturbed areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3.0 feet) between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and moderately low in the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow in the fragipan."
