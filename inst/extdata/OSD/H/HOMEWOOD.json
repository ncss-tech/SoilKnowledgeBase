  "OVERVIEW": "The Homewood series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep or shallow to a fragipan. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess as much as 56 cm (22 inches) thick and in the underlying weathered Illinoian till. Some pedons extend into residual parent materials. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

Chili, Conotton, Negley, and Parke soils are on nearby terraces. Brownsville and Dekalb soils are on siltstone and sandstone hills that do not have a mantle of till. Loudonville and Mechanicsburg soils are on till covered sandstone hills where bedrock is at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches), or more than 102 cm (40 inches), respectively. The somewhat poorly drained Gresham soils and moderately well drained Titusville soils are in a toposequence with Homewood soils. They are on the lower parts of some slopes or in concave landscape positions. Westmoreland soils are in similar landscape positions but are formed in residuum."
