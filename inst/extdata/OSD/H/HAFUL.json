    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 10 to 40 percent and decreases with depth.  Organic carbon ranges from 7 to 9 kg/m2 to a depth of 100 cm.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 to 50 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section (8 to 22 inches) is dry from mid July to mid October and is moist in all parts from early December to mid May.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees from mid April to early December and exceeds 47 degrees F from mid May to mid November.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/2 or 5YR 5/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 2/2; 5YR 4/3 or 4/6.  It is very gravelly, very stony or very bouldery.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.  Base saturation ranges from 20 to 40 percent.\nThe BA horizon is 5YR 5/4, 5/6 or 2.5YR 5/6.  Moist colors are 5YR 4/4 or 4/6.  It is 15 to 20 percent clay and 20 to 50 percent gravel.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  Base saturation ranges from 10 to 30 percent.\nThe Bt1 horizon is 20 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt2 and Bt3 horizons are 5YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 6/8 or 2.5YR 5/8.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 5/8; 5YR 4/6, 5/8; 2.5YR 4/6 or 4/8.  It is 27 to 35 percent clay, 25 to 50 percent sand  and 20 to 30 percent gravel.  Coarse and very coarse sand ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Reaction is very strongly through moderately acid.  Base saturation ranges from 10 to 30 percent.  Percent iron as extractable iron oxide commonly is 5 to 10 percent, but ranges up to 19 percent."
