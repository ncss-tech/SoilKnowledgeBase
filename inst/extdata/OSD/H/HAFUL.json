  "OVERVIEW": "The Haful series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from andesite or metavolcanic rock.  Haful soils are on mountain back slopes or toe slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Organic carbon ranges from 7 to 9 kg/m2 to a depth of 100 cm.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 47 to 50 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section (8 to 22 inches) is dry from mid July to mid October and is moist in all parts from early December to mid May.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees from mid April to early December and exceeds 47 degrees F from mid May to mid November.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/2 or 5YR 5/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 2/2; 5YR 4/3 or 4/6.  It is very gravelly, very stony or very bouldery.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.  Base saturation ranges from 20 to 40 percent.\nThe BA horizon is 5YR 5/4, 5/6 or 2.5YR 5/6.  Moist colors are 5YR 4/4 or 4/6.  It is 15 to 20 percent clay and 20 to 50 percent gravel.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  Base saturation ranges from 10 to 30 percent.\nThe Bt1 horizon is 20 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt2 and Bt3 horizons are 5YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 6/8 or 2.5YR 5/8.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 5/8; 5YR 4/6, 5/8; 2.5YR 4/6 or 4/8.
