These soils formed in volcanic ash over glacial till of mixed mineralogy including granite, argillite, limestone, and serpentine rocks.  Elevations are 1,900 to 4,300 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F., The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches, The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
