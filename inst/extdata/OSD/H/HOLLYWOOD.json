  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to slickensides ranges from 12 to\n30 inches.  Depth to the AC horizon ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  Depth to secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 25\nto 50 inches.  Depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 4 to 8 feet.  Untilled soils have a gilgai microrelief.  The cycles of\nmicroknolls and microbasins are repeated at linear intervals of 4\nto 12 feet.  For these areas the microknolls are 3 to 10 inches higher than the microbasins.  The amplitude between the A and AC horizons ranges from about 3 to 24 inches.\nThe Ap horizon is slightly acid through moderately alkaline, and\nthe remaining horizons are neutral, mildly alkaline, or moderately alkaline.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 2 or 3, and chroma 1.  The A1 or Ap is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty\nclay.  The lower A horizons are silty clay or clay.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 or 5, chroma\n4; and hue of 5Y, value of 4, and chroma 2.  It is silty clay or clay.  Mottles are gray, brown, and yellow.  Soft powdery bodies\nof calcium carbonate range from 2 to 20 percent by volume of the\nAC horizon.  Few to common fragments of limestone occur in the AC horizon."

Beaumont, Eutaw,\nand Garner soils have color values of 3.5 or more within a depth\nof 12 inches in more than half of each pedon.  Brooksville,\nHouston, and Okolona soils have color chromas of 1.5 or greater in the A horizon.  In addition, Houston soils have more than 60\npercent clay in the control section.  Burleson, Clarita, Houston Black, Randall, Roscoe, and San Saba soils have cracks that remain open more than 90 cumulative days in most years.  Lake Charles\nsoils have matrix color chromas of less than 1.5 to a depth of 40 inches or more and lack ACca horizons with soft powdery lime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hollywood soils are on uplands which have depressional or sloping relief.  Slopes range from 0 through 8 percent.  These soils formed in clayey colluvial sediments over limestone.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location the average annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 47 inches."

Colbert, Talbott, and Swink soils are in more convex landscapes and have greater slope gradients.  Colbert soils have strongly acid B horizons.  Dowellton, Panola, and Tupelo soils are in similar landscapes and have comparable slope gradients.  Dowellton soils\nhave B horizons and mixed clay mineralogy.  Panola, Talbott, and Tupelo soils lack intersecting slickensides within a depth of 30 inches.  Swink soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments within the control section and have sola less than 20 inches\nthick."
