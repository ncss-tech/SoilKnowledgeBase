The soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that peaks from July to October and falls evenly throughout the remainder of the year.\nMean annual soil temperature: 50 to 55 degrees F.\nDepth to paralithic contact:  40 to 60 inches to soft shale\nParticle-size control section:\nClay content: 20 to 35 percent\nRock fragment content: 5 to 35 percent, consisting mainly of sandstone and hard shale gravel.\nA horizon:\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 5 or 6 dry; 4 or 5 moist\nChroma: 2 to 4\nRock fragments: gravel, cobbles, and stones range from 0 to 35 percent\nReaction: slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous; slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline\nBk and C horizons:\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y\nValue: 5 or 7 dry; 4 to 6 moist\nChroma: 2 to 4\nTexture: loam, gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, or silty clay.  Thin strata with very gravelly sandy clay loam, extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, and gravelly sandy loam may be present.\nRock fragments:  0 to 35 percent, dominantly sandstone and hard shale gravel that will not slake in water.  Thin strata with 35 to 70 percent rock fragments of gravel and cobbles are present.  In the lower part of the C horizon, there commonly are 20 to 90 percent shale fragments that slake in water.\nReaction: moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous; slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some visible secondary calcium carbonate or calcium sulfate occurs inconsistently and at variable depths."
