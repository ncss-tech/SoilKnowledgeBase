In places, carbonate concretions are on the soil surface and in the A horizon because of crayfish activity or other mixing.\nAp, A, and/or AB horizons:\nHue: 10YR or N (neutral)\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 0 to 2\nReaction: slightly acid to slightly alkaline\nBA, Bg, Bkg, Btg and/or BCg horizons:\nHue: 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y\nValue: 3 to 6\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture; dominantly silty clay loam, but in some pedons it grades to silt loam in the lower part.\nReaction: neutral to moderately alkaline, calcium carbonate concretions are in the lower part in most pedons, and range from few in number to almost continuous masses in horizontal bands or irregular bodies or pockets. In some pedons the only evidence of carbonates is effervescence of the fine earth fraction.\nOther features;\nKrotovina are common throughout the B and C horizons and in places make horizon boundaries obscure.\nCg or 2Cg horizon:\nHue: 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y\nValue: 5 or 6\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: silt loam to a depth of more than 102 cm (40 inches), some pedons are stratified silt loam and loam below a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).\nSand content below a depth of 102 cm (40 inches):  ranges to 30 percent\nGravel content: 0 to 7 percent\nReaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contains carbonates."

Chalmers, Dolbee, Drummer, Elpaso, Elvira, Garwin, Marcus, Mascoutah, Maxfield, Maxmore, Ossian, Patton, and Sable soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 89 cm (35 inches). Chetomba, Gillett Grove, and Madelia soils average more than 5 percent fine sand in the particle-size control section. Dunham soils have more than 7 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Marcus soils have more than 35 percent clay in the surface layers. Maxcreek, Pella, and Rushmore soils have horizons with more than 5 percent fine sand within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Wacousta soils are less than 61 cm (24 inches) to the base of the cambic horizon."

Where drained, these soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 31 cm (1 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. In undrained conditions, the apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."
