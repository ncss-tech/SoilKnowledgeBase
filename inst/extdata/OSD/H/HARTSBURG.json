  "OVERVIEW": "The Hartsburg series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on outwash plains, till plains, and glacial lake plains. These soils formed in loess or other silty materials. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches).",

In some pedons the only evidence of carbonates is effervescence of the fine earth fraction.\nOther features;\nKrotovina are common throughout the B and C horizons and in places make horizon boundaries obscure.\nCg or 2Cg horizon:\nHue: 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y\nValue: 5 or 6\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: silt loam to a depth of more than 102 cm (40 inches), some pedons are stratified silt loam and loam below a depth of 102 cm (40 inches).\nSand content below a depth of 102 cm (40 inches):  ranges to 30 percent\nGravel content: 0 to 7 percent\nReaction: slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contains carbonates."

In undrained conditions, the apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."
