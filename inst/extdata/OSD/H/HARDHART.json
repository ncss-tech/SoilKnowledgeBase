  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rec. PJL-KTS-EMM",
  "REVDATE": "12/2012",
  "STATES": "MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hardhart series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from limestone. These soils are on hills, mountain slopes, ridges, dipslopes, scarp slopes, and structural benches. Slopes are 10 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
