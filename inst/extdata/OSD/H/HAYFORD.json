  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 50 degrees F.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches, depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 6 inches, thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 36 inches, and depth to the IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  Organic carbon ranges from .8 to 2 percent in the mollic epipedon and decreases uniformly as depth increases.  Cation exchange capacity ranges from approximately 70 to 90 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  The Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Usually it has granular structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  The B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chromas of 1 or 2.  It has 35 to 55 percent sand.  This horizon has moderate or strong prismatic or blocky structure.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  The Cca horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR and has common to many mottles.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and has 4 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Contrasting C horizons, which are mottled, occur at depth of 20 to 36 inches.  They range from loamy sand to very gravelly sand."
