  "OVERVIEW": "The Heath series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in thick deposits of moderately fine textured calcalcareous alluvial fan sediments. Heath soils are on fans, hills, valley side slopes, and lower plateaus. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F. The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick, depth to calcareous material ranges from 10 to 40 inches, and the solum to the base of the Bt ranges from 15 to 40 inches thick. The content of organic carbon ranges from .8 to 6 percent in the mollic epipedon and decreases uniformly with depth. Cation exchange capacity ranges from 60 to 90 millequivalents per hundred grams of clay. Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Typically, the upper part of the solum contains less than 15 percent coarse fragments, but the number of coarse fragments usually increases with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline. Usually this horizon has granular or crumb structure, but primary structure is subangular blocky in some pedons. The horizon is soft or slightly hard.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline. This horizon is typically light clay, but clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 15 to 50 percent, and sand from 10 to 40 percent with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. Some lime carbonate in the lower parts.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR. They are moderately or strongly alkaline and calcium carbonate equivalent of the strongest part of the Bk horizon ranges from 15 to 30 percent."

Elevation ranges from 8,400 to 9,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer months.
