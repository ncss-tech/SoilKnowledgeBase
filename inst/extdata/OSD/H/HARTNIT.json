  "OVERVIEW": "The Hartnit series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till, volcanic ash and material weathered from andesite, sandstone, metasedimentary rocks, argillite and basalt.  Hartnit soils are on glacially modified mountain backslopes and plateaus and have slopes of 3 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Content of hard rock fragments in the particle-size control section ranges from 15 to 35 percent by weighted average, although individual horizons contain up to 50 percent hard rock fragments.  Content of weathered rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent by weighted average.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value to 4 or 3 moist or dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist or dry. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry.  It is gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam or cobbly loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bhs and Bs horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  It is gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam or cobbly loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid or moderately acid.  Some pedons have a C horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam, or very gravelly loam."

The soils formed in glacial till, volcanic ash and material derived from andesite, argillite basalt, sandstone, and metasedimentary rocks.  Hartnit soils are in a cool marine climate with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 100 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 56 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 100 days."
