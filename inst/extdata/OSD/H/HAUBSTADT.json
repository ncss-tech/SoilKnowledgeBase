  "OVERVIEW": "The Haubstadt series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep or shallow to a fragipan. They formed in 41 to 102 cm (16 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying weathered outwash, lacustrine sediments, or old alluvium. These soils are on high stream terraces, lake plains, valley trains, kames, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",

Chalfont soils have pararock fragments (shale) in the series control section (2B horizons) and are less than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Gudgel soils have a paralithic contact in within a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Nabb and Shakamak soils have pebbles in the series control section that are derived from glacial till (see Remarks). Pierpont soils are less than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and have carbonates in the lower part of the soil profile. Plumfield soils are less than 51 cm (20 inches) to the top of the fragipan and do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipan. Robbs soils have redox depletions immediately below the surface or subsurface layer. Sciotoville soils contain mica in the series control section. Lawrence soils have redox depletions immediately below the surface layer, are underlain with limestone residuum, and are in the semiactive cation-exchange activity class. Penlaw soils have the depth to the base of the argillic horizon at less than 152 cm (60 inches) and are in the semiactive cation-exchange activity class. Rohrersville soils have fragic soil properties rather than a fragipan and are in the superactive cation-exchange activity class. Rossmoyne soils have pebbles in the series control section that are derived from glacial till and are in the superactive cation-exchange activity class."

The soils formed in 41 to 102 cm (16 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying stratified outwash, old alluvium, or lacustrine sediments within or influenced by the Illinoian glaciation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1143 mm (38 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 160 to 200 days.

Dubois and Otwell soils are in a drainage sequence with Haubstadt soils. Dubois soils are somewhat poorly drained, have grayer subsoils and are on flats of lake plains. Otwell soils are moderately well and well drained, have browner subsoils, and are on shoulders and backslopes of dissected lake plains. Grayford, Loudon, and Rossmoyne soils are on nearby till plains. Negley soils contain more gravel, do not have a fragipan, and are on steeper slopes on dissected parts of terraces or kames. Nicholson soils are on nearby uplands and formed partly in residuum from limestone. Peoga soils are poorly drained, do not have a fragipan, and are on broad flats of lake plains."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 46 to 61 cm (1.5 to 2.0 feet) between January and April in normal years, except in severely eroded pedons which range to a depth of 30 cm (1.0 foot). The potential for surface water runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan, and low in the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow in the fragipan."

The soil properties of these soils are very similar to the Haubstadt soils. Haubstadt soils typically are stratified below the series control section.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 203 cm (Bt, 2Bt, 2Btx, 2B't horizons).\nFragipan: from a depth of 66 to 135 cm (2Btx horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 41 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Sampled for laboratory characterization data (HY-71).
