Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from welded rhyolitic tuff.  The climate is cool and moist in winter and warm and dry in summer.  The average annual precipitation is 330 to 460 mm, and the average annual temperature is 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 65 to 90 days."
