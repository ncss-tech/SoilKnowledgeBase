  "OVERVIEW": "The Hat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in residuum and colluvium from welded rhyolitic tuff.  Hat soils are on structural benches and foothills.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
