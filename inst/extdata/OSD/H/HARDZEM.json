    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hardzem soils are on mountains. They typically occur on backslope or footslope positions. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from calcareous shale and limestone. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,088 to 3,246 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, wet, winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 635 to 900 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."

Hardol soils are very deep, have thick mollic epipedons and calcic horizons, and have carbonatic mineralogy. Haunchee soils are shallow to lithic contacts and have carbonatic mineralogy. Hyzen soils are very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts and have a frigid temperature regime. Wardbay soils are deep to lithic contacts, have thick mollic epipedons and calcic horizons, and have a frigid temperature regime."
