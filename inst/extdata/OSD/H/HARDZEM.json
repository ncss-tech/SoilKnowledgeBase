  "OVERVIEW": "The Hardzem series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale and limestone. Hardzem soils are on mountains. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

The climate is semiarid with cold, wet, winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 635 to 900 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."

Hyzen soils are very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts and have a frigid temperature regime. Wardbay soils are deep to lithic contacts, have thick mollic epipedons and calcic horizons, and have a frigid temperature regime."
