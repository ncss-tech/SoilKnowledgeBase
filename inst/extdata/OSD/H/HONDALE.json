    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: (Additional study is needed, to clearly define and classify this series.)\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 5 to 17 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nParticle size control section - the zone from 5 to 17 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons\n(ADDITIONAL DATA: In 1992, the original type location was sampled for characterization (S92NM-029-003).  Data indicates that there is enough clay size carbonate to change the classification from fine to fine-loamy. SAR values range from 32 to over 100.  Two pedons sampled in Grant County have very little carbonate.  One pedon classified fine (S76-NM-17-22-{1-10}), while the other one is fine-silty (S76-NM-17-26{1-9}).  With this in mind the series is not being updated until it can be studied further.lwh.  The 1992 recommendation is still a valid recommendation this is only a format update.  The pedon sample in Grant County may be in a different moisture and precipitation zone and also a different MLRA (38).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
