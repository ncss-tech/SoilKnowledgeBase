    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 49 to 51 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 30 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.  It is 0 to 15 percent pebbles in the upper part and 10 to 25 percent pebbles in the lower part.  Some pedons are stony and have 0.1 to 3 percent surface stones and boulders and 0 to 5 percent surface cobbles.\nSome pedons have a weakly expressed Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The upper part is sand, gravelly loamy sand, or gravelly loamy coarse sand.  It is 10 to 25 percent pebbles, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The lower part ranges from loamy coarse sand to coarse sand and commonly is gravelly and less commonly very gravelly.  It is 20 to 35 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles."

Slope is 3 to 70 percent.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  The mean January temperature is 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 71 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 150 days."

Hobohill soils were previously called the Beckley series on the Colville Indian Reservation.  Beckley soils are Typic Haploxerolls, but laboratory data on other soils in the same climatic zone suggest that Hobohill soils are Ultic Haploxerolls.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
