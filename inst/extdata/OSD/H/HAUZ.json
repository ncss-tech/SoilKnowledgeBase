  "OVERVIEW": "The Hauz series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from igneous and argillite rock.  They are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
