  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  Free carbonates are in all parts of the pedon.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up about 2 to 8 percent, by volume, throughout.  The average content of clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section typically is 45 to 55 percent with a full range of 35 to 60 percent.  The content of sand in this zone averages between 6 and 25 percent.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  They are silty clay, clay, clay loam and silty clay loam.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 10 percent.\nThe Bw, Bk, Bwss and Bkss horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are typically silty clay and clay and less commonly silty clay loam or clay loam.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The Bw horizons have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 25 percent.  The Bk horizons show evidence of carbonate accumulations as threads, masses or are disseminated throughout and has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 30 percent.  The Bss horizons show genetically developed slickensides tilted 10 to 60 degrees from horizontal.  Tongues of darker colored material are common in these horizons.\nSome pedons have a BCss horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Slope gradient typically is 3 to 12 percent but ranges from 0 to 25 percent.   The soils formed in calcareous clayey glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches, mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F, frost-free period is 90 to 140 days, and elevation is 990 to 1,950 feet ASL."

The moderately well drained Audubon soils are on similar positions but do not have carbonates to the surface.  The moderately well drained Boyerlake soils are on convex shoulder slopes and do not have a dark colored surface layer.  The poorly drained Clearwater and Foxlake soils are level to concave and are in swales and on toeslopes.  The very poorly drained Dovray soils are in closed depressions."
