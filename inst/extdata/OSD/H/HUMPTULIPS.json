The upper part of the control section is silt loam and contains less than 18 percent clay and between 15 and 40 percent fine and coarse sand, and less than 5 percent rock. The C horizon is silt loam stratified with fine sandy loam to sand. The IIC horizon is very gravelly sand or very gravelly loamy sand. The Ap and C horizons have value of 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 2 through 6 dry. The have mainly weak subangular blocky structure or are massive, but the IIC horizon is single grained."

They formed in mixed medium textured alluvium. Humptulips soils occur in a humid climate with relatively cool summers and mild wet winters. Annual precipitation is 60 to 120 inches, average January temperature is 39 degrees F., average July temperature is 60 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F., and the growing season (28 degrees F.) is 180 to 220 days."
