    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family.  Similar soils with mixed mineralogy include the Atter, Carlsborg, Marblespring, Spens, and Valcreek series. Atter soils are dry for over 90 days in the summer and have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 59 degrees F. Carlsborg soils have 60 to 85 percent rock fragments including 15 to 30 percent cobbles in the control section.  Marblespring soils have albic materials (E horizons) and lamellae. Spens soils lack a B horizon and have a solum less than 10 inches thick.  Valcreek soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact."

The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches. Average January temperature is 38 degrees F., average July temperature is 60 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 200 to 240 days."
