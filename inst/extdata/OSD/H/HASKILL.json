  "OVERVIEW": "The Haskill series consists of deep sandy soils developed in wind modified sandy deposits on terraces and outwash fans.  These soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 110 days.",

The ochric epipedon,\nthe argillic horizon, and the ustic moisture regime places these soils in the Alfisols.  The frigid argillic horizon is more than 60 centimeters below the surface plus the tonguing of albic material in the argillic horizon places them in the Paleboralfs.\nOn 3/4/2009 this description is being entered for the first time into the OSD files.  Although it was established in 1957 it has never been in an electronic form.  It has not been reviewed or updated, except for the classification.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
