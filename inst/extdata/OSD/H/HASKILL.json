Most of the area has undulating and low hummocky relief typical of areas of blown sand.  Mean annual precipitation is15 to 20 inches.  The frost-free period is 105 to 125 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0071.  The Haskill series was formerly included with the Gray Wooded soils.  The ochric epipedon,\nthe argillic horizon, and the ustic moisture regime places these soils in the Alfisols.  The frigid argillic horizon is more than 60 centimeters below the surface plus the tonguing of albic material in the argillic horizon places them in the Paleboralfs.\nOn 3/4/2009 this description is being entered for the first time into the OSD files.  Although it was established in 1957 it has never been in an electronic form.  It has not been reviewed or updated, except for the classification.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
