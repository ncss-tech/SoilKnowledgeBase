  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soil temperatures are 47 to 54 degrees F.  Hunting soils have distinct redoximorphic concentrations at some depth between 20 and 40 inches, and have water tables between 20 and 40 inches in some seasons.\nIt ranges from very slightly saline to strongly saline.  Carbonate content ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  Gypsum veining occurs in the lower C horizons below a depth of 12 inches. Texture of the particle-size control section is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, clay loam, or loam and averages 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A and C horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, with dry color values of 5 to 7, moist values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nSaline phases with Czg horizons below a depth of 23 inches are recognized.  These horizons have up to 35 percent shale parachanners and EC of 8 to 20 mmhos/cm."

They are developed in alluvium from marine shale and sandstone.  The climate is arid, with mean annual temperatures of 45 to 53 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 10 inches.  Freeze-free period is from 110 to 160 days."

Billings soils have clay loam or silty clay loam particle-size control sections. Libbings soils are moderately deep, have a gypsic horizon and have an aquic moisture regime.  Ferron and Rafael soils have redoximorphic features above 20 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the layer from surface to 9 inches (Ap horizons)\nRedoximorphic features - in the zone from 30 to 60 inches (C3 horizon)\nGypsum accumulations - in the zone from 27 to 60 inches (C2 and C3 horizons)\nThe classification was changed from Aquic Udifluvent to Aquic Torrifluvents in 9/94.  The placement is tentative because the profile does not have redox depletions of chroma 2 or less above 100 centimeters.  However, there are redoximorphic concentrations and the inference that aquic conditions exist above 100 centimeters.  Additional field work is needed.\nTaxonomic version: Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
