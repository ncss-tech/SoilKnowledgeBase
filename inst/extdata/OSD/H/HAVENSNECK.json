  "OVERVIEW": "The Havensneck series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from interlayered sandstone and shale.  Havensneck soils are on ridgetops and upper side slopes of coastal hills and mountains and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 9 and 25 inches or between 9 inches and paralithic contact if contact is less than 25 inches deep, is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 1 and is dry in some or all parts from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 25 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 2.5Y 5/4 or 6/2.  Clay content is 10 to 15 percent.  Base saturation (sum) is 30 to 45 percent.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe B horizon is 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6, 7/4 or 7/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 6/8.  Clay content is 10 to 25 percent.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Base saturation (sum) is 15 to 30 percent.

Soil formed in material weathered from interlayered sandstone and shale.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A moderate marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range in temperature.  Mean annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 58 degrees F. and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 250 to 330 days."

Ferncreek, Gibney, Quinliven and Shinglemill soils are very deep.  They formed in marine sediments and are on remnant marine terraces below the ridge system on which Havensneck soils are found.  Fishrock and Iversen soils are clayey.  They are found in the same landscape position as Havensneck but formed dominantly from shale parent material."
