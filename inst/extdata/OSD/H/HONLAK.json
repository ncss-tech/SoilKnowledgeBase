  "OVERVIEW": "The Honlak series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic and volcanic rocks.  Honlak soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
