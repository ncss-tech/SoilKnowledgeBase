  "REVDATE": "06/2006",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hendrie series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
