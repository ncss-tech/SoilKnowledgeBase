  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to about 80 inches.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline and it is slightly or strongly effervescent throughout.  Bedding planes or thin discontinuous stratification ranges from faint to distinct in some part of the control section.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section for less than 110 cumulative days during the growing season in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Horizons with mollic colors are less than 10 inches thick.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Pressure faces and small slickensides range from none to common.  Some pedons contain few very fine to medium concretions of calcium carbonate.  Very fine or fine fragments of shells range from none to few.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has colors in shades of red or brown.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.   Very fine and fine concretions of calcium carbonate range from none to few.\nThe C/B horizon is stratified layers of silt loam, silty  loam, silty clay, and clay.  The layers are less than an inch to about 6 inches thick.  Layers thicker than about 2 inches typically have structure.  Some pedons have very fine sandy loam to loamy fine sand strata.  However, the average texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Very fine and fine concretions of calcium carbonate range from none to few."

Aspermont, Clairemont, and Clemville soils have fine-silty control sections.  Ellis soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy. Mangum soils are dry in the moisture control section for more than 110 cumulative days during the growing season in most years.  Ships soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section, and have strongly expressed vertic features.  Weswood soils have coarse-silty control sections."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 69 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 40 inches.  Frost free days range from 270 to 280.  Elevation ranges from 200 to 350 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 54 to 64."
