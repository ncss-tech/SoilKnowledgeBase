The average texture mixed would be sand, but is fine sand in some pedons. Some pedons contain thin strata of loamy fine sand.\nStructure: Single grain or massive.\nConsistence: Loose or soft and very friable.\nReaction: Commonly moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline, but is slightly alkaline in the upper part in some pedons.\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: Segregated as few coats on rock fragments or coarse sand grains.\nEffervescence: Subhorizons are slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 0 to 5 percent.\nOther features: Some pedons have substrata composed of lacustrine deposits below 100 cm with texture of silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have strata with relict redoximorphic features as masses of iron accumulation with hue of 7.5YR."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Als, Ecklund, Isolde, Kawich, Razito, Sheppard, Stumble, Sundown, Tipper, Tipperary, Tricera, and Yenrab series.\nAls soils are noncalcareous throughout and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C.  Ecklund and Tipper soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Isolde, Kawich, Sheppard, and Sundown soils do not have Ck horizons.  Also, Isolde soils do not have stratified textures in the control section; Sheppard soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout; and Sundown soils have control sections dominated by loamy fine sand and are not stratified.  Razito soils are effervescent throughout the entire profile, are not stratified, and do not have Ck horizons.  Stumble soils have dominantly loamy sand or loamy fine sand control sections with some strata containing 15 to 35 percent gravel.  Tipperary soils are effervescent throughout or to within 25 cm of the soil surface, are moist in the spring and early summer, and have soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C.  Tricera soils are noncalcareous to depths greater than 100 cm, are not stratified, and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 10 degrees C.  Yenrab soils have sodium adsorption ratios of greater than 13 within 30 cm of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hawsley soils are on sand sheets. They formed in alluvium and water-reworked eolian sand derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,158 to 1,646 meters. In Idaho, elevations range as low as 762 to 1,006 meters. The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 178 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
