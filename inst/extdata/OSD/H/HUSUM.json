  "OVERVIEW": "The Husum series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from basalt and andesite. Husum soils are on river terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section is usually moist, but is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice. The upper 24 to 36 inches of 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, phosphate retention of 25 to 50 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent. The lower part has moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc and volcanic glass content of 0 to 5 percent. Rock fragments in the control section averages from 45 to 85 percent. Depth to the 2C horizon is 24 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR and chroma of 2 to 6 dry and moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 dry and moist. Texture is very gravelly ashy loam or extremely gravelly ashy loam. Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist. Texture is extremely cobbly loamy sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly sandy loam."
