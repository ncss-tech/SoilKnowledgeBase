  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Herbel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from igneous rocks such as rhyolite, monzonite and andesite.  Herbel soils are on alluvial fans and coalescent fan piedmonts with slopes of 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nWhen the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the description and/or the classification of this series. It was suggested that this soil should classify in the great group of Haplocambids. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions."
