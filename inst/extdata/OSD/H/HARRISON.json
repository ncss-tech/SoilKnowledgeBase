Blackberry soils average less than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Buckhart soils have less than 7 percent sand within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Keltner soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Totanang soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harrison soils are on the crests and upper side slopes of convex ridges and broad interstream divides on the Illinoian till plain. Slope gradients range from 0 to 10 percent. These soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of Wisconsinan loess and the underlying coarser textured Roxana silt or loamy materials. These materials contain more sand than the overlying loess. They are underlain at depths generally between 152 to 178 cm (60 and 70 inches) by Illinoian till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Mean annual temperature varies from 11.1 to 13.9 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation varies from 889 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cowden, Darmstadt, Douglas, Herrick, Piasa, Tamalco, Velma, and Virden soils. Cowden, Piasa, and Virden soils are poorly drained, have a fine textured control section, and are on nearly level parts of the loess covered till plains nearby at either higher or lower elevations. In addition, the Piasa soils have a natric horizon. The somewhat poorly drained Darmstadt and the moderately well drained Tamalco soils are on similar parts of the landscape nearby or on side slopes along drainageways and have a natric horizon. The well drained Douglas soils are on slightly higher positions in the landscape. The somewhat poorly drained Herrick soils are nearby on convex ridges or interstream divides with low relief and are either at higher or lower elevations. The well drained  Velma soils contain more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the control section and are down slope from Harrison soils."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface water runoff is medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the solum and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the underlying till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Permeability is moderate in the solum and slow in the underlying till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Because of the underlying paleosol, these soils have a perched water table seasonally at depths of 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet)."
