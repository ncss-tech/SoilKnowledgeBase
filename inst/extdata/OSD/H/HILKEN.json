Mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 60 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 14 inches, of which more than one-half occurs as severe thunderstorms in July through September.  The average frost-free period ranges from 180 to 200 days and elevation ranges from 4,200 to 5,300 feet."
