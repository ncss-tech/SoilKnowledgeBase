  "REVDATE": "11/97",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hilken series consists of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained, moderately permeable soils on mesas and plains.  They formed in alluvium with some eolian influence derived from shale and sandstone.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
