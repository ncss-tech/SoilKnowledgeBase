  "OVERVIEW": "The Hurlbut series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from metamorphosed sedimentary rock.  Hurlbut soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 65 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 48 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts from July until November.  Most pedons have up to 30 percent gravel with the larger amounts in the uppermost horizons.  Base saturation is 30 to 50 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 3/4; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/4, 6/6; 10YR 4/3, 6/6, 6/4, 6/3, 5/4 dry and 5YR 4/6, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4, 4/6; 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3 moist.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly fine sandy loam.  It has subangular blocky or granular structure.
