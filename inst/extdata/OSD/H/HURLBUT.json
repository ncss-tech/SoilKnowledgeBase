  "OVERVIEW": "The Hurlbut series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from metamorphosed sedimentary rock.  Hurlbut soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 65 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 48 degrees F.",

Base saturation is 30 to 50 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 3/4; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/4, 6/6; 10YR 4/3, 6/6, 6/4, 6/3, 5/4 dry and 5YR 4/6, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4, 4/6; 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3 moist.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly fine sandy loam.  It has subangular blocky or granular structure.
