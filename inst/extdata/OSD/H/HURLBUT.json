The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts from July until November.  Most pedons have up to 30 percent gravel with the larger amounts in the uppermost horizons.  Base saturation is 30 to 50 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 3/4; 7.5YR 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/4, 6/6; 10YR 4/3, 6/6, 6/4, 6/3, 5/4 dry and 5YR 4/6, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4, 4/6; 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3 moist.

Elevations are 1,200 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is typified by warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 75 inches.  Average January temperature is about 35 degrees F; average July temperature is about 68 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 57 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 100 to 200 days."
