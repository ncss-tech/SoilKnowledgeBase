  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils have umbric epipedons (B.S.<50 percent in some part), cambic horizons with base saturation less than 35 percent.  The soils are usually moist and not dry for 60 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 59 degrees F.  and there is less than 9 degrees F. difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperature.  The mineralogy of the clay fraction is high in vermiculite.  Thickness of the solum is 20 to 46 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact is 20 to over 60 inches.  Reaction decreases with depth.\nThe A horizon ranges in color from brown to dark brown (7.5YR hue); in texture from fine sandy loam to loam, in reaction from medium to  slightly acid (pH 6.0 to 6.1).\nThe B2 horizon ranges in color from brown to light yellowish brown (7.5YR and 10YR hues) and brown to dark brown and reddish brown (7.5YR and 5YR hues) moist; in texture from loam, sandy clay loam and heavy silt loam; in reaction from slightly to strongly acid (pH 6.1-5.5), acidity increasing with depth.\nThe B2 horizon may rest directly on the weathered soft sandstone (paralithic contact) or a light yellowish brown, strongly acid upper C horizon may be present.  The underlying substratum may be soft sandstone, conglomerate or wind-modified sands."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soil in another family are Tonini soils which have coarse loamy control sections.  Similar soils in other groups are Melbourne which have silty clay argillic horizons; Empire and Larabee which have argillic horizons; Goldridge which have ochric epipedons and argillic horizons.  Hugo, Sheetiron and Tish Tang soils are dry for 60 consecutive days in most years and have more than 9 degrees F.  difference between mean annual winter and summer soil temperatures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hely soils occur on steep to very steep uplands underlain by soft sandstone.  Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent.  They occur at elevations of sea level to 1,300 feet in a humid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 40 to 90 inches, with nearly rainless, foggy summers and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F., average January temperature about 48 degrees F., and average July temperature about 57 degrees F.  Frost-free season averages about 225 to 275 days."
