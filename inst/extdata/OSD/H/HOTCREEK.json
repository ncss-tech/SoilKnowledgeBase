Colors are for air-dry soil unless otherwise stated.)\nA--0 to 5 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 3/3) moist; strong thin platy structure; hard, friable, slightly sticky; few very fine, fine and medium roots; many fine and medium vesicular pores; 35 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones; slightly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

These soils formed in residuum and local alluvium from vitric tuff, breccia and basalt.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 230 to 300 mm.  Average annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
