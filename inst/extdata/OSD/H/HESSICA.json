The soil temperature is below 8.3 degrees C from about December 1 to March 1, and is below 5 degrees C from about January 1 to February 1.  The soil between the depths of 15 and 41 cm is dry throughout for 200 to 225 days from about May 15 to December 15.  It is moist throughout for 65 to 80 days from about January 15 to April 1 and is moist in some or all parts for 70 to 85 consecutive days from about March 1 to May 15 when the soil is above 8.3 degrees C.  Aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.  In some pedons there is a transitional AB or BA horizon.  Below a depth of 94 cm redox concentrations are present.\nThe A horizon color 2.5Y 5/1, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2; 10YR 6/1, 6/2, 6/3 or 7/2.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 5/3; 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 5/3.

It is slightly to violently effervescent and carbonates are segregated as common fine and medium soft masses and filaments.  Some pedons contain up to 15 percent manganese oxide stains.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 8 dS/m and sodium-adsorption-ratio is 13 to 25 in the upper part and 25 to 40 in the lower part.  Organic carbon averages 0.5 to 1.5 percent in the upper portion of the horizon.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon colors is 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 6/2, 7/2; 5Y 7/3, 7/2, 6/3; or 10YR 6/3.
