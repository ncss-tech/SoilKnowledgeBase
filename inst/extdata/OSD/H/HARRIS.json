  "OVERVIEW": "The Harris series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils. These soils formed in saline clay derived from Halocene age coastal sediments. Slope is less than 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm (50 in).",
