  "OVERVIEW": "The Hazmaz series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over glaciofluvial deposits derived from sedimentary and quartzite rocks.  Hazmaz soils are on strath terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
