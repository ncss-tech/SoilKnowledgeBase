  "OVERVIEW": "The Happus series consists of moderately deep to pumice, somewhat excessively drained soils on toe slopes of canyons.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from mixed volcanic ash and pumice.  Slopes are 12 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to fragmental pumice is 20 to 40 inches.  The solum has 40 to 80 percent pumice, 30 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate including 5 to 20 percent 0.5 to 2.0 mm pumice, 15 to 25 percent phosphate retention, 0.2 to 0.8 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, and 8 to 15 percent 15-bar water retention (air-dried).  The particle-size control section has 5 to 10 percent field estimated clay, and 65 to 80 percent pumice gravel.  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 40 to 55 percent pumice gravel and 5 to 15 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  It contains 65 to 80 percent pumice gravel and 10 to 20 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice.\nThe C horizon has value of 7 or 8 moist and dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is fragmental pumice with less than 10 percent (by volume) of particles less than 2.0 mm diameter."
