    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to fragmental pumice is 20 to 40 inches.  The solum has 40 to 80 percent pumice, 30 to 40 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate including 5 to 20 percent 0.5 to 2.0 mm pumice, 15 to 25 percent phosphate retention, 0.2 to 0.8 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, and 8 to 15 percent 15-bar water retention (air-dried).  The particle-size control section has 5 to 10 percent field estimated clay, and 65 to 80 percent pumice gravel.  Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 40 to 55 percent pumice gravel and 5 to 15 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  It contains 65 to 80 percent pumice gravel and 10 to 20 percent 0.5mm to 2.0mm pumice.\nThe C horizon has value of 7 or 8 moist and dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is fragmental pumice with less than 10 percent (by volume) of particles less than 2.0 mm diameter."

The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from mixed volcanic ash and pumice.  Slopes are 12 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 2200 to 3200 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
