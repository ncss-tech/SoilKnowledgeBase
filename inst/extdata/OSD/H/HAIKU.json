  "OVERVIEW": "The Haiku series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic igneous rock and influenced by tropospheric dust.  Haiku soils are on uplands and have slopes of 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,564 millimeters (62 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C. (72 degrees F.).",
