  "OVERVIEW": "The Hannarocks series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic sources. Hannarocks soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 750 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.5 degrees C.",
