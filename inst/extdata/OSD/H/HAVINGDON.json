Clenage soils have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. . Maderbak soils have soil temperature of 11 to 15 degrees C and receive 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation. Pulcan and Zephan soils lack a lithic contact within 100 cm.  Surgem and Vanwyper soils lack accumulation of secondary carbonates at the lithic contact.  Additionally Vanwyper soils have mainly cobble-sized rock fragments 1n the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Havingdon soils are on mountain and foothill side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum derived from chert and shale with some influence from loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,400 to 2,010 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."
