  "OVERVIEW": "The Havingdon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from chert and shale with some influence from loess and volcanic ash. Havingdon soils are on mountain and foothill side slopes and shoulders.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Maderbak soils have soil temperature of 11 to 15 degrees C and receive 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation. Pulcan and Zephan soils lack a lithic contact within 100 cm.  Surgem and Vanwyper soils lack accumulation of secondary carbonates at the lithic contact.  Additionally Vanwyper soils have mainly cobble-sized rock fragments 1n the Bt horizon."
