  "OVERVIEW": "The Hisle series consists of moderately deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in clayey sediments weathered from clay shale on uplands.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedded shale typically is about 20 to 26 inches and ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Colors of the soil commonly are inherited from the underlying shale.  A few small pebbles are on the surface and mixed throughout the solum in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam or loam and ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  When dry, the surface is crusted up to 1/8 inch thick.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay or silty clay averaging between 50 and 60 percent clay.  It ranges from slighty to strongly alkaline.  The Btn horizon has weak or moderate, fine to coarse columnar structure parting to moderate or strong, fine to coarse blocky structure in the upper part.  Accumulations of salts and carbonates are in the lower Btn horizon of some pedons.\nThe Bkz horizon has hue of 10R to 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay or clay.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonate and typically has accumulations of gypsum and salts.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  It contains up to 15 percent fragments of shale by volume.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R to 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay, or silty clay.  Fragments of shale increase with depth and range up to 80 percent by volume.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  Most pedons contain accumulations of carbonate and salts.\nThe Cr horizon is shale and hue of 10R to 5Y.  It ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."
