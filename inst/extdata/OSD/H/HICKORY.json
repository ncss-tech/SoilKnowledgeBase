  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of the argillic horizon is greater than 40 inches and solum thickness is less than 80 inches. The loess mantle, where present, is less than 20 inches in thickness. Carbonates, where present, are below a depth of 40 inches. Rock fragments are commonly mixed throughout the series control section except where the upper part of the soil formed in loess. The rock fragments are typically igneous rocks, but in a few places include sedimentary rocks from a local source. The particle-size control section averages 24 to 35 percent clay, 15 to 45 percent fine sand and coarser, and less than 20 percent rock fragments.\nThe Ap or A horizon has properties as follows. The A horizon has value of 2 to 4 (4 to 6 dry) and chroma of 2 or 3. The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 (5 to 7 dry), and chroma of 2 to 6. The A or Ap horizon is loam or silt loam except some eroded pedons are clay loam or silty clay loam. Rock Fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid, except pedons that have been limed range to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 (5 to 7 dry) and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid except pedons that have been limed range to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. Hue of 2.5Y in the matrix is accompanied by chroma of 4 or higher. Redoximorphic features have chroma of 3 to 8. The Bt horizon commonly is clay loam, but in some pedons the first subhorizon is silty clay loam, and in other pedons the lower horizons are loam, and less commonly gravelly clay loam. Rock Fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the most acid part and ranges to neutral in the lower part.\nThe BCt or BC horizon has the same color as the Bt horizon. It is commonly clay loam or loam, and less commonly gravelly clay loam or sandy loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline. Carbonate content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe CB or C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 8. Chroma of 1 or 2 are thought to be relict and not considered redox features. Texture is commonly loam, clay loam, and less commonly, sandy loam or gravelly analogues of these textures. Rock Fragment content by volume averages about 5 percent and ranges from 2 to 20 percent. Reaction is commonly neutral to moderately alkaline, but ranges to slightly acid. Carbonate content ranges from 0 to 25 percent."

Amanda soils have rock fragments in the series control section dominated by sandstone and shale. Belmont, High Gap, Lumberton, Military, Pignut (T) and Woodbine soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 60 inches. Belmore, Chili, Gallman, Kanawha, Kosciusko, Martinsville, Ockley, Richardville, Turnersburg (T) soils contain, in some part of the series control section, subhorizons that contain more than 52 percent sand and/or more than 20 percent gravel. Cliftycreek soils average more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Crouse soils have solum thickness greater than 80 inches when the modern and buried soil is combined. Greybrook soils average less than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and formed in loess and the underlying lacustrine sediments. Kidder, LeRoy, Relay, Senachwine, Strawn and Wawasee soils are less than 40 inches to the base of the argillic horizon. Princeton and Riddles soils have lamella as part of the argillic horizon. Skeleton soils are more acid than slightly acid in the substratum. Wawaka soils have sola greater than 80 inches thick.\nChenault, Conestoga, Hollinger, and Nollville (T) soils have not been updated for cation exchange activity class. These soils may or may not compete with the Hickory soils when their classification is updated."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hickory soils are on convex slopes in dissected parts of the Illinoian till plain. They formed in Illinoian glacial till that can be capped with as much as 20 inches of loess. Illite is considered to be the dominant clay mineral in the till. Slope ranges from 5 to 70 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 48 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation is 360 to 1000 feet above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Atlas, Blair, Bunkum, Fishhook and Passport soils are on shoulders and backslopes above the Hickory soils. The well drained or moderately well drained, more silty Ava, Elco, Fayette, Hosmer, and Menfro soils are on shoulders and summits above the Hickory soils. The moderately deep Gosport and Marseilles soils are on lower lying backslopes. In Indiana, Hickory soils are also associated with the Avonburg, Blocher, Bonnell, Cincinnati, Nabb, Rossmoyne, Shakamak, and Vigo soils. The somewhat poorly drained Avonburg and Vigo soils are on higher lying summits. The moderately well drained Blocher, Nabb, Rossmoyne and Shakamak soils are on higher lying shoulders and summits. The well drained Cincinnati soils are on higher lying summits, shoulders and backslopes."
