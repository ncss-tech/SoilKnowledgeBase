The thickness of the solum and the depth to unconsolidated till ranges from 15 to 35 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  Phyllite fragments in the control section average from 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid throughout.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and 3 through 6 dry.  It is very gravelly silt loam, or very gravelly loam.  Some pedons have an A or E horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 7 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam."

The soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, till and colluvium. The till is locally derived from talc and phyllite.  The mean January temperature is 37 degrees F, mean July temperature is 61 degrees F, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches.  The frost-free season is 140 to 220 days."
