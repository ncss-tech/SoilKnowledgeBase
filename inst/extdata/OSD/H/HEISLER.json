  "OVERVIEW": "The Heisler series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till high in phyllite with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils are on glaciated mountainsides with slopes of 8 to 65 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 60 inches.",

The thickness of the solum and the depth to unconsolidated till ranges from 15 to 35 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  Phyllite fragments in the control section average from 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid or medium acid throughout.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and 3 through 6 dry.  It is very gravelly silt loam, or very gravelly loam.  Some pedons have an A or E horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 7 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam."
