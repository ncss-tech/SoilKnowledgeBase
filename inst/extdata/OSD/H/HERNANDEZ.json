  "OVERVIEW": "The Hernandez series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and eolian sediments on alluvial fans and valley fill. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abra, Bighams, Bowdish, Copeman, Creel, Darvey, Honlu, Kimera, Kitipes (T), Molen (T), Numa, Peachsprings, and Xenmack series. Abra soils may have horizons up to 15 percent rock fragments in any one horizon, Bighams, Bowdish, Creel, Molen, and Xenmack soils have lithic or  paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Kitipes soils have alluvial parent material from sandstone and shale. Darvey soils have a moderately deep calcic horizon. Honlu and Peachsprings soils have 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control section. Copeman soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in and below the lower particle-size control section. Numa soils have a man-made Ap horizon that borders on a mollic epipedon in color and an anthropic epipedon in content of nitrogen and phosphorus. In addition, Creel, Darvey, Kimera and Numa soils are in the Western Great Plains (LRR-G) and are more moist in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hernandez soils formed in mixed alluvium and eolian sediments derived presumably from basalt. Hernandez soils are on upland fans and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 7,000 to 8,000 feet. The soils formed in moderately fine textured alluvium. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 to 13 inches of which approximately 8 inches falls during the period from May through October as intense thunderstorms. The remainder occurs mainly as snow during the period November through April. The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 125 to 135 days."
