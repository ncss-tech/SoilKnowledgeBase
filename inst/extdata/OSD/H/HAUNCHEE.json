These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from dolomite, calcite, calcareous shale and limestone. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,920 to 3,180 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 700 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 40 to 70 days."
