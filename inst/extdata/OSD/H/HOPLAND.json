The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone and shale at elevations of 660 to 1070 meters (200 to 3,500 feet). The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation varies from 760 to 1520 millimeters (30 to 60 inches).  Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C (44 degrees F); mean July temperature is 22 degrees C (72 degrees F); mean annual temperature is 12 to 15 degrees C (53 to 59 degrees F).  Frost-free period ranges from 140 to 250 days."
