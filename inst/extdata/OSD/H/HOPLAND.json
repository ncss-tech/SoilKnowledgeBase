  "OVERVIEW": "The Hopland series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone or shale.  Hopland soils are moderately deep to paralithic material with spacing between cracks less than 10 centimeters apart. Hopland soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 1070 millimeters (42 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).",
