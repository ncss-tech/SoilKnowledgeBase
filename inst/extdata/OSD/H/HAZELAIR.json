  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 to 55 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days. Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the solum above the nonconforming 2C clay horizons ranges from 12 to 24 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 19 inches. Few fine distinct yellowish brown or reddish brown masses of iron accumulation are in the solum, in some pedons, and redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are at depths of less than 20 inches. Horizon boundaries are generally abrupt but range to clear.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 40 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Soil reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 in the upper 7 inches and 3 or 4 below 7 inches moist and 2 to 4 dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 40 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Soil reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Soil reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue predominantly 2.5Y but ranges to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay.  It has 60 to 70 percent clay, 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent paragravel. Soil reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hazelair soils are on hills at elevations of 200 to 2,500 feet. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent. The soils formed in silty glaciolacustrine deposits or colluvium over clayey residuum derived from sandstone, siltstone or volcanic tuff. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean January temperature is about 39 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

Bellpine, Dixonville, Goodin, Ritner, Steiwer and Willakenzie soils do not have redoximorphic features of chroma of 2 or less within 30 inches. These soils occur on more linear or convex parts of the hillslope. Chehulpum, Philomath and Witzel soils have bedrock at depths of more than 40 inches. Dupee, Helmick, and Panther soils have bedrock at depths of more than 40 inches. Dupee soils occur on footslopes or toeslopes. Helmick soils occur on smooth, low hills. Panther soils occur on concave parts of the hillslope."
