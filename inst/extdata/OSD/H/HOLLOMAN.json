  "OVERVIEW": "The Holloman series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous, and gypsiferous sediments.  Holloman soils are on basins, valley floors or adjacent terraces and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

The root restricting gypsiferous layers are hard and massive alternating with soft powdery gypsum, calcium carbonate, and sediments to a depth of 60 inches or more.  The hard layers are 2 to 8 inches thick, the soft layers are 2 to 30 inches or more thick.\nParticle-size control section:  fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam and silt loam, with a clay content of 10 to 27 percent.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Holloman soils are on basin and valley floors and on adjacent terraces in bolsons where they formed in alluvial and eolian sediments or lime and gypsum that precipitated out from surface and subsurface water.  These sediments probably have been moved and mixed by wind and water since their original deposition.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range to 50 percent.  Elevations are 2,500 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is semiarid or arid.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 to 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 58 to 65 degrees F.  Frost free period is 190 to 230 days in New Mexico and as long as 240 days in Texas."

Yesum soils are deep and have a gypsic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  A question as to whether the hard layers of gypsum are geologic or genetic needs to be resolved.  Possible, as mapped, the series might include both.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 5 inches (A horizon)\nEntisol feature - lack of diagnostic features\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nWhen the competing series section was updated in September 2001, questions were raised about the description and/or the classification of this series. It was suggested that this soil should classify in the suborder of Gypsids. A field study of the type location is recommended to resolve the questions."
