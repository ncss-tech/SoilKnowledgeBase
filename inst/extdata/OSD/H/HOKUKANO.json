  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hokukano soils are on upper elevation, leeward slopes on the uplands of Hualalai and Mauna Loa volcanoes at elevations from 1067 to 2133 meters (3500 to 7000 feet). These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe lava flows that are 3,000 to 5,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C. (53 to 57 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
