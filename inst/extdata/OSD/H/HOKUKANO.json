  "OVERVIEW": "The Hokukano series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava. Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 890 millimeters (35 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C. (55 degrees F.)",

These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to moderately steep pahoehoe lava flows that are 3,000 to 5,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C. (53 to 57 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C.
