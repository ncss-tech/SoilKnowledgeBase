  "OVERVIEW": "The Houghtonville series consists of very deep, well drained  soils on glaciated uplands.  They formed in loamy till.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid.  Slope ranges from 3 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid throughout the soil. Rock fragments are mostly pebbles and cobbles and range from less than 5  percent to 50 percent in individual horizons, but the  weighted average is less than 35 percent.  Clay averages less than 18% in the particle-size control section.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR,  value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.

Berkshire soils have a spodic horizon less than 17 inches thick, a Bhs and/or Bh thickness of less than 4 inches, and are generally at lower elevations than Houghtonville soils.

They are on  mountain side slopes, mountain tops, mountain ridges, hill  tops, and hill slopes.  Slope ranges from 3 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in loamy till of Wisconsin age that is derived mainly from schist, gneiss, granite, or anorthosite.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 40 to 60 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from about 60 to 120 days.  Elevation is typically between about 1,500 and 2,500 feet."

The shallow Hogback soils and moderately deep Rawsonville soils are in similar positions on the landscape as Houghtonville soils.  Mundal soils are moderately well drained, have a dense substratum and are in similar positions on the landscape.  Worden soils are somewhat poorly drained, have a dense substratum, and are in lower positions of sloping uplands or at the base of slopes.  Wilmington soils are  poorly drained, have a dense substratum, and are on nearly level to sloping concave or depressional upland areas."

The spodic horizon, especially the Bhs, exhibits some  \"thixotropic like\" properties, i.e., smeariness, high  organic carbon content, high effective clay percentage, high  K value, and fragile nature (easily damaged by use).  3.  The diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this  pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (O and A  horizons).\nb.  Albic horizon - the zone from 6 to 8 inches (E horizon).\nc.  Spodic horizon - the zone from 8 to 25 inches (Bhs and  Bs1 horizons)."
