  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to the discontinuity range from 14 to 30 inches. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the summer and autumn. Mean annual soil temperature is 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick. The soils are slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It is silt loam or loam and is\nmodified by gravel, cobbles or stones in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is silt loam or loam and averages 10 to 18 percent clay. The upper part has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and the lower part 25 to 50 percent. The weighted average of rock fragments in the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe 2C horizon below depth of 30 inches has moderately coarse to coarse texture and has 35 to 90 percent rock fragments."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hesseltine soils are on glacial outwash plains at elevations of 2,000 to 3,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. These soils formed in glacial outwash with a thin mantle of loess. They occur in a continental climate having dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 20 inches. Average January temperature is 25 degrees F., average July temperature is 68 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 140 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil include:\nMollic epipedon - from 0.5 to 10 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - from 10 to 28 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section the zone from 10 to 28 inches (Bt horizons)\nThe Hesseltine series and the original type location are no longer recognized in Spokane County. The type location was moved to Stevens County in 03/2012 because that is the largest remaining acreage extent. Significant acreage (more than 71,000 acres) of the Hesseltine series and its associated phases (varying depth classes, surface stoniness - both on and in the soil, etc.) in Spokane County was remapped in the update (extensive revision) using numerous series.\nMLRA evaluation notes- further investigation is needed to determine the presence and extent of the volcanic ash influence in surface layers throughout Stevens, Lincoln and Whitman counties in addition to an evaluation of the ecological site assignments. Hesseltine is currently a Benchmark soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
