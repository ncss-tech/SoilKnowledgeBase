  "OVERVIEW": "The Haxby series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from hard fine grained sandstone or igneous rock.  These soils are on ridges, cuestas, hills and strath terraces. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
