  "OVERVIEW": "The Hukill series consists of deep, well drained soils that\nformed in residuum and colluvium weathered from andesite or\nandesite tuff.  Hukill soils are on plateaus and have slopes of 1\nto 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches\nand the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
