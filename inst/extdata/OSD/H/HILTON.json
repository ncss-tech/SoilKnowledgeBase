  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 29 to 48 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 29 to 48 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent in the solum and substratum and, in many pedons, the percentage increases with depth.\nThe Ap horizon ranges from very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) to brown (7.5YR 5/2), from fine sandy loam through light silt loam. Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon and its interfingering among peds in the top of B extend to a depth ranging from 13 to 20 inches. The E ranges from yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) to dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2) and typically mottled. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. Structure is platy or weak fine blocky, or it is massive. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B/E horizon has colors and textures similar to the Bt and E horizons respectively. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or fine subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Redoximorphic features may be present. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizons range from dark brown (10YR 4/3) to reddish brown (2.5YR 5/4) and contains redoximorphic features. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam containing 18 to 27 percent clay, with individual subhorizons ranging from 15 to 35 percent clay. Structure is moderate or strong medium or coarse blocky. Consistence is firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. Clay films are present on peds and as pore linings and are most abundant in the lower part.\nThe C or Cd horizon is firm or very firm dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) to reddish brown (5YR 5/4) loam or fine sandy loam. The horizon is massive or has thick plate like divisions. It is slightly to strongly effervescent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Adamstown, Beech, Blakeslee, Cazenovia, El Dara, Funkstown, Kidami, Lima, Miami, Pevely, Rainsville, Rawson, Richland, Shawtown, Summitville, and Vaughnsville series in the same family. Adamstown, Kidami, Miami, and Rainsville have lithologic discontinuities within 20 inches of the surface. Beech soils do not have carbonates within 80 inches. Blakeslee, Rawson, Shawtown, and Vaughnsville are formed in outwash and other stratified materials. Cazenovia soils have 28 to 35 percent clay in the control section. El Dara soils are formed in Cretaceous deposits. Funkstown soils have limestone residuum below a depth of 25 inches. Lima soils have shallower solum and shallower depth to carbonates, also the depth to the Bt horizon is within 29 inches. Pevely soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Summitville soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 80 inches.\nThe Aurora, Conesus, Danley, Honeoye, Lansing, Ontario, Nunda, Wampsville, and Wassaic are series in similar families. Aurora and Wassaic soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Conesus, Danley and Nunda soils have 2 chroma redox depletions in the argillic horizon. Honeoye, Lansing, and Ontario soils lack the high-chroma concentrations typical of the Bt horizon of Hilton soils. Wampsville soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A new pedon from Genesee County was used because the typical pedon does not match the typical pedon for Hilton in the Monroe County, NY Soil Survey. After a review of the use of the Hilton and Lima series the range of the solum depth of Hilton is changed to 29 to 48 and the competing series section was updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Albic horizon - the zone from 9 to 17 inches (E horizon).\n3. Argillic horizon - the zone from 17 to 36 inches below the soil surface (B/E and Bt horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
