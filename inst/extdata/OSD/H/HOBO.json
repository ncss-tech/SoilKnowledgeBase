  "OVERVIEW": "The Hobo series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on benches, dissected terraces and hills. They formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived dominantly from shales, quartzite, or mica schist, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Permeability is slow. Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 38 inches and average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
