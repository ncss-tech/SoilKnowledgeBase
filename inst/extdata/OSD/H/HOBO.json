These soils formed in colluvium and tertiary alluvium derived dominantly from shale, quartzite, or mica schist, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Elevations range from 1,600 to 4,000 feet. The average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches. The frost-free period is from 80 to 110 days."
