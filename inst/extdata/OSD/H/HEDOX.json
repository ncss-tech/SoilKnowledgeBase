  "OVERVIEW": "The Hedox series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum material weathered from diatomaceous earth and lacustrine tuff.  Hedox soils are on hills and side slopes of plateaus and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

It is never moist in some part between 6 and 14 inches for 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is greater than 47 degrees F.  Temperature above 41 degrees F is from about March 15 to December 1 and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15.  Clay content is 18 to 25 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/2, 7/3, 6/2 or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 3/2, or 3/3.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent.  Textures are loam and stony loam.  Thickness ranges from 7 to 15 inches.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 8/3, 7/3 or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 6/3 or 5/3.  Texture is loam and gravelly loam. In the upper C horizon rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent.  In the lower C horizon the reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline and rock fragments range from 15 to 30 percent."
