It is never moist in some part between 6 and 14 inches for 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is greater than 47 degrees F.  Temperature above 41 degrees F is from about March 15 to December 1 and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15.  Clay content is 18 to 25 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 7/2, 7/3, 6/2 or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 3/2, or 3/3.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent.  Textures are loam and stony loam.  Thickness ranges from 7 to 15 inches.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 8/3, 7/3 or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 6/3 or 5/3.  Texture is loam and gravelly loam. In the upper C horizon rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent.  In the lower C horizon the reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline and rock fragments range from 15 to 30 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hedox soils are on hills and sideslopes of plateaus.  Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from diatomacious earth and lacustrine tuff.  Elevations are from 4,000 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. Snowfall is 20 to 30 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 29 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F; mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 50 to 80 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS;  These are the Porterfield (T), Deven and Eastable (T) soils.  Porterfield soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact and are on convex positions within areas of Hedox soils.  Deven soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact, have mollic epipedons and argillic horizons.  They are on plateaus above Hedox soils.  Eastable soils are greater than 60 inches deep and are on alluvial fans below Hammond soils."
