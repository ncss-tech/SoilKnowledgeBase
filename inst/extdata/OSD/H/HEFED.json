Basket, Breko, Chiefrange and Huilepass soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days between July and September due to convection storms. Cowgill soils range from 50 to 76 cm to the base of the argillic horizon. Drino, Lithgow and Schader soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Hunewill soils have extremely gravelly or cobbly sand below the Bt horizon. Jungo and Stucky soils contain 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Plush soils have bedrock at 100 to 150 cm.  Washoe soils have combined thickness of A and Bt horizon that ranges from 80 to 114 cm thick, with the argillic horizon from 60 to 100 cm thick."

These soils formed in colluvium derived mainly from basic igneous and metavolcanic rock. The climate is semiarid with cold winters and hot summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
