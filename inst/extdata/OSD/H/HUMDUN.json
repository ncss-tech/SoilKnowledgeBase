  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Humdun soils are on fan piedmont remnants, fan terraces, mountains and foothill side slopes. These soils formed in loess with a moderate component of volcanic ash over alluvium derived mostly extrusive volcanic rocks such as andesite and tuff or alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Elevations are 1,460 to 1,830 meters.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The climate is cool and semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
