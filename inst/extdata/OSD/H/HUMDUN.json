  "OVERVIEW": "The Humdun series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess with a moderate component of volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mostly extrusive volcanic rocks.  The Humdun soils are on fan piedmont remnants, fan terraces, foothill and mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 275 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
