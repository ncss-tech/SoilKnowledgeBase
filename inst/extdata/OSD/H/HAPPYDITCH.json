  "OVERVIEW": "The Happyditch series consists of very deep, well drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in sandy alluvium. These soils are on flood plains in the river valleys of the Central High Tablelands (MLRA 72). Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches (46 centimeters).",
