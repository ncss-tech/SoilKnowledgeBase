  "OVERVIEW": "The Hodad series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that are formed in loess. They are on loess covered basalt plains. Permeability is moderate.\nSlopes are 2 to 12 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches.\nThe average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
