  "OVERVIEW": "The Hellgate series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in highly weathered colluvium, residuum, and valley fill from granitic rocks with a minor component of loess.  These soils are on fan terraces and mountain toeslopes.  Slopes are 3 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 18 inches thick.  Solum thickness is 22 to 36 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 12 percent clay, 25 to 50 percent coarse and very coarse sand, and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam.  It has weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is 15 to 30 percent mostly fine pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AB horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam and is nongravelly in some pedons.  It has weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is 10 to 30 pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon is multicolored or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand, and is gravelly or very gravelly.  It is 20 to 45 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."
