    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 18 inches thick.  Solum thickness is 22 to 36 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 12 percent clay, 25 to 50 percent coarse and very coarse sand, and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly coarse sandy loam.  It has weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is 15 to 30 percent mostly fine pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AB horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam and is nongravelly in some pedons.  It has weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is 10 to 30 pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon is multicolored or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand, and is gravelly or very gravelly.  It is 20 to 45 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

Ardening soils have 15 to 35 percent weathered schist fragments in the particle-size control section and are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days.   Billyridge soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  Burrant soils have 0 to 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Canderly soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F and have a solum more than 40 inches deep.  Catelli, Ginnis, Shangland, and Texascreek soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Crouch soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 56 to 58 degrees F.  Picard and Rebecca soils are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days.  Roney soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Wind River soils have a mean soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F and have a solum 15 to 25 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hellgate soils are on fan terraces and toeslopes of mountains.  These soils formed in colluvium residuum, and valley fill from highly weathered granitic rocks with a minor component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 3 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 1,600 to 2,700 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
