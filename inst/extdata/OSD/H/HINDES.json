Depths were originally in English units.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon--0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 in) (A and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon-20 to 79 cm (8 to 31 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nCalcic horizon-79 to 157 cm (31 to 62 in) (BCk horizon).\nSkeletal feature--more than 35 percent by volume of fragments in particle-size control section.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle-size and chemical properties analysis  were performed at the project office for the initial soil survey of McMullen County on pedons S10TX3112575, S09TX3115002, and S10TX3115002.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
