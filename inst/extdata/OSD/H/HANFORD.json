  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 59 to 68 degrees F., and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F. for any significant period.  Soil between the depths of about 8 to 24 inches usually is dry all of the time from late April or May until November or early December and usually is moist in some or all parts of this section all the rest of the year.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam or gravelly equivalents of each.  The coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 percent.  The particle size control section has little or no stratification.  Clay content usually averages 6 to 18 percent.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent and decreases regularly with increasing depth.  Below a depth of 40 inches some pedons have marked stratification.  The soils are medium acid to slightly alkaline and usually become more alkaline with depth.  Secondary free carbonates do not occur above a depth of 40 inches. In some cases carbonates have been added to the soil by farmers which results in slight effervescence in the surface layers.\nThe A horizon is pale brown or light brownish gray (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/3, 6/2).\nThe C horizon is very pale brown, pale brown or light yellowish brown (10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4)."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Honcut, Pollasky and Saugus series.  Honcut soils have more silt or clay in the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section, lower available water holding capacity, and/or redder hues.  Pollasky soils are underlain by unrelated moderately consolidated sandy sediments at depths of less than 40 inches.  Saugus soils have a paralithic contact at depths of more than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hanford soils are on stream bottoms, floodplains and alluvial fans at elevations of 150 to 3,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in deep, moderately coarse textured alluvium dominantly from granite and other quartz bearing rocks of similar texture.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is about 45 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 81 degrees F.  The frost free season is 200 to 280 days."
