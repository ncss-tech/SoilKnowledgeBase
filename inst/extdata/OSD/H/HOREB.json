  "OVERVIEW": "The Horeb series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and glacial till derived from mixed materials. Horeb soils are on terraces and mountain footslopes. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Rock fragments in the 10- to 40-inch control section range from 10 to 25 percent.  Soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.  Umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry in the upper part and 2 or 3 moist and dry in the lower part. It is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is loam with 18 to 27 percent clay, has more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, and has 10 to 25 percent pebbles. Some pedons have up to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. Redox features with chroma of 2 through 6 are at depths of 24 to 36 inches. The C horizon below a depth of 40 inches is loam with 25 to 85 percent rock fragments. In some pedons it is very gravelly sand."
