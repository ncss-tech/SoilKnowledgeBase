  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hospah soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from shale and sandstone of the Menefee formation of the Mesa Verde Group. These soils occur on escarpments and hillslopes of mesas, cuestas, and ridges. Slopes are 2 to 55 percent. Elevations range from 6,400 to 7,000 feet. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. The frost free period is 120 to 140 days."

The Bond, Hagerman, Tintero, and Penistaja soils have argillic horizons. The San Mateo, Sparank, and Zia soils are very deep. The Skyvillage soils are loamy and have a lithic contact with sandstone."
