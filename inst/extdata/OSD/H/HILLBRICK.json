  "OVERVIEW": "The Hillbrick series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone or shale. Hillbrick soils are on foothills and mountains and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The soil from a depth of 8 inches to the lithic contact is dry in all parts from about April 15 to November 15 and is moist in some parts the rest of they year. The mean annual soil temperature is 60 degrees F. and is never below 47 degrees F. at any time. Clay is 8 to 18 percent. Hillbrick soils have a xeric bordering on aridic moisture regime.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 7/3, 6/4 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/4, 4/3 or 5/3. It is sandy loam, loam, or channery sandy loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. Shale or gravel content ranges from 0 to 30 percent. Rock fragments are 2 mm to 2 cm in diameter. It is slightly to violently efferevescent.  Some pedons contain up to 5 percent angular cobbles.  Some pedons have a C horizon."
