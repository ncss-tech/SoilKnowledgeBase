  "OVERVIEW": "The Highprairie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Highprairie soils are on steep and very steep hill slopes and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1750 millimeters (70 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
