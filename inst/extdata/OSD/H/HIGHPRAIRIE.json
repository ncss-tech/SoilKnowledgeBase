The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1520 to 2030 millimeters (60 to 80 inches). Mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 300 to 365 days."
