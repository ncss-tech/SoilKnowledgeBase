  "REVDATE": "10/2016",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hutsinpillar series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in depressions in drainageways, alluvial fans, and uplifted marine terraces. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1780 millimeters (70 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
