  "OVERVIEW": "The Hardtrigger series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from volcaniclastic material.  Hardtrigger soils are on fan terraces, calderas and structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the average annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.",

Abgese soils have argillic horizons that extend to depths of 75 to 100 cm and have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part (Btk horizon).  Ackelton soils have a calcic horizon and a duripan.  Ackley, Greenbrae, Hoosegow and Lankbush soils are noncalcareous above 86 cm.  Blacknest soils are 50 to 100 cm to sand and gravel.  Colbar and Sidlake soils have lithic or paralithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100.  Harsan soils have moderately fine textured Bk horizons in the lower part of the profile.  Paulville and Turria soils have less than 35 percent fine sand and coarser in the control section.  Sevy and Zane soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Shawave soils have massive Btk horizon with noneffervescent matrix and Bk horizons that have less than 10 percent clay with noneffervescent matrix.  Windypoint soils lack secondary silica and are 64 to 100 cm deep to sand and gravel."

The remainder of the OSD has not been updated since 5/93.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 cm (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon and particle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 51 cm (Bt1, Bt2 and Btk horizons).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated."
