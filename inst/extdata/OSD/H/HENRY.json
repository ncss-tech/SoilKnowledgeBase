  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 48 to more than 72 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the A, E and B horizons and ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the BC and C horizons.  Surface layers are less acid where recently limed.  Depth to a horizon with more than 10 percent sand is 40 inches or more.  Clay content between 10 inches and the top of the fragipan ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  Much of the illuvial clay is in vertical streaks and pockets rather than being uniformly distributed throughout the B horizon.\nThe Ap horizon, or A if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Iron accumulations and depletions range from none to common in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.\nThe Eg horizon has chroma of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  The A horizon texture is dominantly silt loam, but also includes silt.\nThe Btxg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  Some pedons are variegated in shades of brown, yellow and gray without a dominant matrix color.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and\nchroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons have a 2BC and/or 2C horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  These brown colors are in the Roxana loess formation where it occurs within 3 to 5 feet of the surface.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  The texture is silt loam or silt."

Bonn and Foley soils are a fine-silty family, contain natric horizons and no fragipan.  Calhoun and Routon soils are in a fine-silty family and do not contain a fragipan.  Calloway and Grenada soils are in a fine-silty family and are moderately well drained."
