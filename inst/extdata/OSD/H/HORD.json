  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hord soils are nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces.  In some locations, the soils are mapped in loess on uplands.   On stream terraces they formed in a mixture of loess and alluvium, on uplands the soils formed in loess.  Dominant slope gradient is less than 1 percent, but the range is from 0 to 7 percent.  The range of mean annual temperature is from 10-14 degrees C (49 to 57 degrees F).  The range of mean annual precipitation is from 510 to 710 millimeters (20 to 28 inches)."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Phases correlated to date include wet substratum, bedrock substratum, sandy substratum and terrace.  Hord soils were formerly classified as Pachic.  A different series should be used for those areas mapped in the upland position.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 72 centimeters (0 to 28 inches) thick (Ap, A and Bw horizon) and cambic horizon--the zone from 36 to 72 centimeters (14 to 28 inches) (the Bw horizon). Buried soils are below a depth of 102 centimeters (40 inches) in some areas.\n3/20 KEG converted measurements to metric\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
