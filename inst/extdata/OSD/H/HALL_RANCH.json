The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 degrees F or more. The depth to soft andesitic or rhyolitic bedrock (paralithic contact) is 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments in the control section range from 5 to 35 percent. The base saturation of the upper 30 inches ranges from 60 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 thru 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam, gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam or stony loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is gravelly loam, gravelly silt loam, stony loam, stony silt loam or gravelly clay loam.
