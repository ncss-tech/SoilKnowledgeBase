  "OVERVIEW": "The Hall Ranch series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed loess, ash and colluvium weathered from andesite and ryolite. Hall Ranch soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 degrees F or more. The depth to soft andesitic or rhyolitic bedrock (paralithic contact) is 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments in the control section range from 5 to 35 percent.
