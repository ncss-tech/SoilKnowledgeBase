The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNote: The current profile has a sandy-skeletal textural family.  A new type location with a loamy-skeletal textural family will be found by the Dillon, MT Soil Survey Office. Currently, the following surveys are using Hiore - MT605, MT627, MT632, MT635, MT637 and MT670. (04/19/2011)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
