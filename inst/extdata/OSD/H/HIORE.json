  "OVERVIEW": "The Hiore series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium and residuum derived from coarse-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNote: The current profile has a sandy-skeletal textural family.  A new type location with a loamy-skeletal textural family will be found by the Dillon, MT Soil Survey Office. Currently, the following surveys are using Hiore - MT605, MT627, MT632, MT635, MT637 and MT670. (04/19/2011)"
