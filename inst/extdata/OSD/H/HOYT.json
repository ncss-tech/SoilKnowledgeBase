  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoyt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from igneous bedrock and glacial till.  These soils are on mountains, moraines, hills and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
