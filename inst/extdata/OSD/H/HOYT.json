  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoyt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from igneous bedrock and glacial till.  These soils are on mountains, moraines, hills and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
