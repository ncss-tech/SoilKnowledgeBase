The soils formed in mixed fine textured alluvium. The climate is humid, characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 300 days. These soils are on the Whiskey Run geomorphic surface."
