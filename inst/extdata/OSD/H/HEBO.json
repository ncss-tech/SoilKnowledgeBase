    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The profiles are over 60 inches thick but the rooting depth is limited dominantly to less than 20 inches. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick. Thickness of the solum is 24 to 48 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F. The difference between the mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. Soil reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid above 40 inches and extremely acid to moderately acid below.\nThe Ap or A and BA horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Redox features are few to many and faint to distinct in hue 7.5YR and 5YR.\nThe BA horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe Bg, Bw, or BCg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 or less moist and dry. Redox features have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR. Texture is silty clay or clay with 40 to 60 percent clay. Occasional thin sand and gravel lenses occur in the lower B horizons.\nThe 2Cg or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 5 percent pararock fragments.Occasional thin sand and gravel lenses may occur."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hebo soils are on nearly level to depressional areas on terraces at elevations of 20 to 300 feet. Slopes are 0 to 7 percent. The soils formed in mixed fine textured alluvium. The climate is humid, characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 300 days. These soils are on the Whiskey Run geomorphic surface."

Chitwood and Walluski soils are somewhat poorly drained and moderately well drained respectively and lack redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less above 20 inches. Knappa soils are well drained and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. All of these soils are on terraces."
