Rock fragments of gravel size are less than 5 percent by volume in the series control section.  The particle size control section is a continuous layer or combination of discontinuous layers with a combined thickness greater than 3 inches. The particle size control section has 8 to 18 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It has values less than 5.5 when dry. Typically it is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Eg horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox concentrations are typically present.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have Bg, Bkg, or BC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is stratified and the textures are variable over short vertical distances consisting of loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loamy sand and sand.  It is strongly acid to moderately alkaline."

They formed in stratified glacial lacustrine and glaciofluvial sediments with strata consisting mostly of material that is fine sand or finer. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils have 100 to 140 frost free days.  The elevation is 1000 to 1450 feet.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches."
