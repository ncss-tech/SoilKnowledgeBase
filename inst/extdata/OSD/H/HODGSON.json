  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hodgson soils are on terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent.  They formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over calcareous glaciolacustrine deposits; some areas, formed in landslide or mudflow deposits from lake sediments.  Elevations are 1,300 to 2,000 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 21 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

Clayton, Hunters, Kewach, Martella and Scala soils are on similar landforms as the Hodgson soils. Laketon soils are on lake terraces."
