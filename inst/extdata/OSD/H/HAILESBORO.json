  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hailesboro series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake plains and lower valley walls. They formed in silty sediments deposited in still water. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity in the mineral soil surface and subsurface layers is moderately high or high. It is moderately low to high in the subsoil and substratum. Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",

Boothbay and Depeyster soils have a udic moisture regime. Muskellunge soils have a fine textured particle-size class. Mino, Swanville, Swanton, Roundabout, and Wegatchie soils do not have argillic horizons. Niagara soils have a mesic temperature regime."

The slope is commonly 1 to 4 percent, but ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in lake deposited silts and clays. The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 50 inches. The growing season ranges from 100 to 150 days.

Depeyster soils are in higher positions on the landscape and do not have low chroma colors dominant in the matrix or in coatings on ped faces in the argillic horizon. Insula and Summerville soils are in higher positions on the landscape than Hailesboro soils and are shallow to bedrock. Malone soils are coarse-loamy and are on the footslopes and backslopes of hills and ridges. Mino and Swanton soils are on similar positions on the landscape as Hailesboro soils. Mino soils are coarse-loamy and Swanton soils are coarse-loamy over clayey. Wegatchie soils are in depressions and have color values in the A horizon of less than 4 moist or less than 6 dry, crushed and smoothed."

Aqualfs suborder - redoximorphic features in all layers between the bottom of the Ap and 16 inches (BE horizon and top of Btg horizon), and redoximorphic concentrations and 50 percent or more redoximorphic depletions with a chroma of 2 in the matrix within the top 4 inches of the argillic horizon (Btg horizon).\nd. Aeric subgroup - one or more horizon between the Ap horizon and a depth of 30 inches, in 50 percent or more of the soil matrix, a hue of 10YR and a value and chroma of 3 or more (BE horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for two pedons in St. Lawrence County, New York; S82NY-89-001 and S82NY-89-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
