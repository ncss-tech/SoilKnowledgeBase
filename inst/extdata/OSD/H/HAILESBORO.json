Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent by volume throughout the soil.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BE or BEg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btg or Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is dominantly silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction, with thin subhorizons of very fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BCg or BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg or C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no currently no other series in the same family.\nBoothbay, Depeyster, Muskellunge, Mino, Niagara, Swanville, Swanton, Roundabout, and Wegatchie are similar soils in related families. Boothbay and Depeyster soils have a udic moisture regime. Muskellunge soils have a fine textured particle-size class. Mino, Swanville, Swanton, Roundabout, and Wegatchie soils do not have argillic horizons. Niagara soils have a mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hailesboro soils are on lacustrine plains and lower valley walls that have a concave or slightly convex surface. The slope is commonly 1 to 4 percent, but ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in lake deposited silts and clays. The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 50 inches. The growing season ranges from 100 to 150 days. The elevation range is 300 to 2000 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Depeyster, Insula, Malone, Mino, Summerville, Swanton, and Wegatchie series. Depeyster soils are in higher positions on the landscape and do not have low chroma colors dominant in the matrix or in coatings on ped faces in the argillic horizon. Insula and Summerville soils are in higher positions on the landscape than Hailesboro soils and are shallow to bedrock. Malone soils are coarse-loamy and are on the footslopes and backslopes of hills and ridges. Mino and Swanton soils are on similar positions on the landscape as Hailesboro soils. Mino soils are coarse-loamy and Swanton soils are coarse-loamy over clayey. Wegatchie soils are in depressions and have color values in the A horizon of less than 4 moist or less than 6 dry, crushed and smoothed."

Aqualfs suborder - redoximorphic features in all layers between the bottom of the Ap and 16 inches (BE horizon and top of Btg horizon), and redoximorphic concentrations and 50 percent or more redoximorphic depletions with a chroma of 2 in the matrix within the top 4 inches of the argillic horizon (Btg horizon).\nd. Aeric subgroup - one or more horizon between the Ap horizon and a depth of 30 inches, in 50 percent or more of the soil matrix, a hue of 10YR and a value and chroma of 3 or more (BE horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for two pedons in St. Lawrence County, New York; S82NY-89-001 and S82NY-89-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
