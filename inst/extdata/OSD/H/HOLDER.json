Severely eroded Holder soils will no longer classify as Mollisols and need to be recorrelated to a new series.\n10/17/05 JCR LM\nChanged to semi-tab format, added metric conversions, updated competing series and changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity\nOSD Modification DJK 1/2012;\nEdited landform positions in introduction and geographic setting.\nUpdated climate in introduction and geographic setting.\nAdded elevation to typical pedon.\nAdded quad and lat/long to type location.\nAdded clay contents and sand contents for PSCS and horizons in RIC.  Deleted thickness of solum and added depth to argillic.\nUpdated competing series.\nDeleted Coly, Cozad, Hobbs, Hord, and Uly from geographically associated soils because not near type location and added Crete.\nChanged Ksat from high to moderately high.\nAdded LRRs and MRLAs for Distribution and Extent.\nAdded additional NSSL pedons for Holder to additional data.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL characterization data available for pedons 76NE023048, 80NE081123, 88KS061148, 89KS061241, S01NE-143-001A, S01NE-143-007, S01NE-143-012, and S01NE-143-013.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
