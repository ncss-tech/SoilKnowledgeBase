  "OVERVIEW": "The Hierro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from sedimentary rocks. Hierro soils are on fans, mountain slopes, and valley side slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
