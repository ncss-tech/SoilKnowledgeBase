  "OVERVIEW": "The Hayes series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid over slowly permeable soils that formed in moderately coarse eolian deposits over a buried alluvial soil. These soils are on dunes on paleo-terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Mean annual air temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters). Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.",
