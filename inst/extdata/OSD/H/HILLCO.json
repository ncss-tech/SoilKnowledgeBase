  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is moderately alkaline and, except for the A horizon in some pedons, is calcareous.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 35 to about 50 percent in the control\nsection.\nThe A horizon is dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2), reddish brown (5YR 4/3), dark brown (7.5YR 4/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), or dark brown (10/YR 4/3, 3/3).  It ranges from clay loam to silty clay loam and contains common fragments and pebbles of limestone.\nThe B21ca and B22ca horizons are reddish brown (5YR 5/3, 5/4,\n4/4), reddish gray (5YR 5/2), reddish yellow (5YR 6/6), yellowish\nred (5YR 5/6, 5/8), brown (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), dark brown (7.5YR\n4/4), reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6), or dark yellowish brown (10YR\n4/4).  They are clay loam or silty clay loam and contain common fragments and pebbles of limestone.  The silicate clay content\nranges from 24 to 35 percent.\nThe B23ca and B3ca horizons are pinkish white (5YR 8/2), reddish yellow (5YR 7/8, 6/8), brown (7.5YR 5/4), reddish yellow (7.5YR\n6/6, 6/8), very pale brown (10YR 8/3, 7/4), pale brown (10YR 6/3,\nor light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4).  They are gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly silty clay loam.  Bodies of soft\nlime are common in the B3ca.  The B3ca contains 15 to 35 percent fragments of limestone 2 mm to 2 inches in diameter.\nA Cca horizon is present in some pedons above the lithic contact.  Where present, it also contains about 15 to 35 percent fragments\nof limestone 2 mm to 2 inches in diameter.\nThe R layer is platy to massive limestone that is fractured in the upper part and massive below.  The upper 2 to 3 feet is rippable."

Aledo, Ector, and Lueders soils have\nsola less than 20 inches thick and contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Altoga soils have ochric epipedons.  Asher, Engle, Lewisville, Quanah, and Venus soils have mixed mineralogy and lack lithic materials within 40 inches.\nAustin soils have a paralithic contact to soft chalk.  Bolar soils have a calcic horizon, a paralithic contact, and generally have\nhues yellower than 7.5YR.  Chatt soils lack a lithic contact and\nhave sola 40 to 60 inches thick.  Denton soils have vertic\nproperties and have a fine textured control section.  Lott soils\nlack a lithic or paralithic contact."
