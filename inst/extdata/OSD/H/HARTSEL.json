  "OVERVIEW": "The Hartsel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Hartsel soils are on treads of flood-plain steps.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).",
