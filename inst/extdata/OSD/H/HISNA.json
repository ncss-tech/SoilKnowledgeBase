  "OVERVIEW": "The Hisna series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in an organic mat overlying stratified loamy alluvium underlain by very gravelly and cobbly alluvium.  Hisna soils are on floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

The upper part of the control section consists of stratified sediments that ranges from 10 to 22 inches in thickness and is coarse-loamy upon mixing.  A gleyed matrix is present to the surface of the mineral soil.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline in the organic horizons and neutral to moderately alkaline in the mineral soil.\nThe Ag horizon has hue of 5Y, 5GY, 5G or 5BG; value moist of 4, or 5.  Texture is stratified and includes sand, fine sandy loam and silt loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of  5Y, 5GY, 5G or 5BG; value moist of 4 or 5; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is stratified and includes sand, fine sandy loam, and silt loam.  These horizons have a gleyed matrix .\nThe 2Cg horizon (when present) has hue of  5Y, 5GY, 5G or 5BG; value moist of 4 or 5; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent and include 35 to 70 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 30 percent rounded cobble.  These horizons have a gleyed matrix .\nThe 2C horizons are variegated sand, gravel, and cobble.  Texture includes sand or coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent and include 35 to 70 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 30 percent rounded cobble.  Pockets and strata of sand and silt are common"
