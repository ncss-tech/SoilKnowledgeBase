  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall. They are continuously saturated with water within 40 inches of the soil surface for 90 days or more during late winter and early spring. Depth to the uppermost limit of the perched water table and aquic conditions is 20 to 30 inches.  The particle-size control section has 40 to 50 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and averages 35 to 55 percent gravel, cobbles, and stones.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 3 or 4 moist. It averages 35 to 55 percent rock fragments."
