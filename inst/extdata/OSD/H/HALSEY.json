  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to sand and gravel ranges from 20 to 39 inches and varies widely within short horizontal distances. Depth to bedrock is greater than 6 feet. The particle size control section averages 7 to 18 percent clay. Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and 0 to 65 percent in the C horizon. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral in the solum and moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the C horizon. Depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more.\nO horizons are commonly slightly or moderately decomposed plant material with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nA and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam and their mucky analogues. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or very weak fine to coarse subangular blocky, and consistence is very friable or friable when moist.\nE horizons, when present, are 0 to 10 inches thick and have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 0 or 1. Structure is platy, prismatic, or subangular blocky and consistence is friable or firm when moist and hard when dry.\nThe B horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 5Y and 5BG, or are neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 8. Matrix colors have chroma of 2 or less due to iron depletion. Masses of iron accumulation, with chroma of 4 or more, are distinct or prominent, medium or coarse, and range from few to many. Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Structure is subangular blocky, or platy, and consistence is friable or firm when moist, and hard when dry. It is granular and very friable in some places.\nThe 2Cg or 2C layers have hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. Chroma of 0 to 4 is allowed below a 30 inch depth. Texture is coarse sand to loamy fine sand above 40 inches and their gravelly or very gravelly analogues and coarse sand to fine sandy loam below 40 inches and their gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogues. The layer is commonly structureless and consistence ranges from loose to firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Currently there are no other series in the same family.\nThe Chance, Fredon, Homer, Leicester, Raypol, Red Hook, and Walpole series are similar soils in related families.\nChance soils are from outside of LRR R and S and have coarser textures and rock fragments dominated by granite and basalt gravel. Fredon, Raypol, Red Hook, and Walpole soils have a subhorizon within a depth of 30 inches in which dominant chroma is more than 2. Leicester soils have a pH of less than 5.5 (in H2O, 1:1) throughout the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Halsey soils are in shallow depressions on level to nearly level terraces and flood plain steps and occasionally in seepage areas of steeper sloping terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in outwash derived mainly from quartz, slate, shale, and sandstone with minor amounts of limestone, granite, gneiss, and schist. The climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F. Precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches and is well distributed throughout the year. Frost-free days range from 130 to 170 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bath, Conotton, Fredon, Hazen, Palmyra, Phelps, Red Hook, and Wassaic soils on nearby landscapes. Conotton, Fredon, Hazen, Phelps, Palmyra, and Red Hook soils occupy better drained positions on glaciofluvial terraces. Bath soils formed in till and have a fragipan. Wassaic soils formed in till and are moderately deep to limestone."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Halsey soils are very poorly drained and have a seasonal high water table near the surface throughout the year, unless drained. The soil is ponded to a depth of 0.5 feet above the surface on level areas and in depressions and is wet from the surface to 0.5 feet below the surface on areas that are nearly level to gently sloping. Surface drainage is slow because of inadequate outlets. Halsey soils on low terraces are subject to occasional or frequent flooding in some places. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum. Runoff is negligible to low."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mostly wooded. Natural vegetation consists of red maple, elm, ash, willow, sedges, and rushes. Small areas have been cleared and drained, and are used as pastureland or for growing vegetables or hay."
