Organic carbon content in the upper cubic meter of the soil ranges from 12 to 15 kg.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature varies from 3 to 6 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 8 and 19 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 15 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 5/1, 5/2, 6/1, or 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 4/1, 4/2 or 5/1.  Clay content is 5 to 13 percent.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Reaction is strongly to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/6 or 6/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 4/6 or 5/6.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam with 10 to 23 percent clay.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 10 to 35 percent.

The soils formed in eolian sands that blanket the marine terraces.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual ranges of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 57 degree F. and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 290 to 365 days."

Cleone and Tregoning soils are associated with shallow drainageways that dissect the terraces.  Tregoning soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to an iron cemented hardpan.  Casper soils are fine loamy.  Cleone soils have mottles in the lower Bt and C horizons."
