    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to sand or gravelly sand layer is more than 40 inches. The particle-size control section is 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments. The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 52 degrees F. The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. The upper 7 to 14 inches of mineral soil has andic soil properties with a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 3 to 4 percent, phosphate retention is 85 to 100 percent and 15-bar water retention is 20 to 30 percent for air-dried samples. Base saturation is less than 35 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A and Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 moist, 3 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 and 3. It is strongly acid or very strongly acid. Some pedons have thin dark yellowish brown bands of iron cementation or iron stains. It has 2 to 3 cmol/kg of aluminum. It has 10 to 25 percent organic matter.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and 1 through 3 dry. The low chromas are inherited from the parent material. This horizon is mostly stratified silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam and sandy loam, with thin layers (less than 3 inches tick) of fine sand, sand and loamy sand.\nThe 3C and 4C horizons are coarsely stratified fine sandy loam, sand, loamy sand, gravelly fine sandy loam, very gravelly sand, and extremely gravelly coarse sand. It is strongly acid or very strongly acid. Some pedons have dark yellowish brown and olive brown iron stains."
