    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: After reclassifying there are no soils in this family.  Prior to reclassification competing soils included the Countshill, Culbertson, Dolason, Doty, and Hullt soils. Countshill soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Culbertson soils contain more than a trace of glass and are formed in volcanic ash and loess. Dolason soils have an umbric epipedon greater than 50 cm thick. Doty soils are formed in alluvium on stream terraces. Hullt soils have bedrock above 150 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hoagland soils are on linear or slightly concave or convex positions on mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 450 to 900 meters.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 3050 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 240 to 280 days.  These soils are thought to be in areas which were previously grasslands and oak woodlands that have been invaded by Douglas-fir."
