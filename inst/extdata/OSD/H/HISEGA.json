(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise stated.)\n0i--1 to 0 inch; forest litter and slightly decomposed forest litter.   (1 to 3 inches thick)\nA--0 to 4 inches; dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak medium and coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable; many fine and medium roots; 10 percent by volume fragments of schist; neutral; clear wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to consolidated bedrock typically is below 60 inches but ranges from 40 inches.  Depth to fractured bedrock containing soil material and with evidence of rock structure typically is between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Content of coarse fragments of rock range from 10 to 50 percent by volume in the solum and 50 to 80 percent by volume in the C horizon.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 24 inches thick.  Dark colors extend to 60 inches or more in some pedon but the organic carbon is less than 0.6 percent.  The control section averages 8 to 15 percent clay.  Free carbonates are below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  The solum is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam or silt loam with 10 to 30 percent by volume channers.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or silt loam with 15 to 50 percent by volume channers.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or silt loam with 50 to 80 percent by volume channers or flagstones.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

These soils formed in residuum derived from micaceous metamorphic rocks.   Mean annual air temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 27 inches."

Buska, Citadel, Grizzly, Pactola, and Vanocker soils are on similar landscapes as the Hisega soils.  Buska soils have an argillic horizon.  Citadel, Grizzly, Pactola, Stovho, Trebor, Vanocker, and Virkula soils do not have a high content of mica.  Stovho and Trebor soils are on higher elevations and are colder.  Virkula soils typically are on less sloping parts of the landscape."
