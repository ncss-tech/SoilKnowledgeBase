  "OVERVIEW": "The Hisega series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from micaceous metamorphic rocks on mountains.  They have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F, and the annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to consolidated bedrock typically is below 60 inches but ranges from 40 inches.  Depth to fractured bedrock containing soil material and with evidence of rock structure typically is between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Content of coarse fragments of rock range from 10 to 50 percent by volume in the solum and 50 to 80 percent by volume in the C horizon.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 24 inches thick.  Dark colors extend to 60 inches or more in some pedon but the organic carbon is less than 0.6 percent.  The control section averages 8 to 15 percent clay.  Free carbonates are below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  The solum is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam or silt loam with 10 to 30 percent by volume channers.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or silt loam with 15 to 50 percent by volume channers.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or silt loam with 50 to 80 percent by volume channers or flagstones.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

Buska, Citadel, Grizzly, Pactola, and Vanocker soils are on similar landscapes as the Hisega soils.  Buska soils have an argillic horizon.  Citadel, Grizzly, Pactola, Stovho, Trebor, Vanocker, and Virkula soils do not have a high content of mica.  Stovho and Trebor soils are on higher elevations and are colder.  Virkula soils typically are on less sloping parts of the landscape."
