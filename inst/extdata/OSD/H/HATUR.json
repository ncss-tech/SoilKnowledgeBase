  "OVERVIEW": "The Hatur series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolostone.  Hatur soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are l5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
