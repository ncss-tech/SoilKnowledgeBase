  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 50 inches.  Depth to lithic contact ranges from 40 to 80 inches .  Rock fragments of angular sandstone, dominantly less than 10 inches in size, range from 5 to 70 percent in individual horizons of the solum and from 35 to 80 percent in the C horizon.  Boulders, stones, flags and channers cover about 5 to 60 percent of the surface of some pedons. The control section averages less than 18 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through extremely acid throughout where unlimed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The A or Ap horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine- earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. The B horizon has more than 40 percent sand.  The upper part of the  B horizon is sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction, and the lower part may range from loam to loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky, but can be granular in the Bhs horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It ranges from loam to loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Dekalb and Wallen are the only other series in this family.  They both have lithic contact 20 to 40 inches below the surface.\nLehew, Marbleyard, and Hailey are in related families.  Lehew and Marbleyard have lithic contact 20 to 40 inches below the surface.  Hailey soils formed in cherty limestone residuum and are in a higher cation exchange activity class.\nThe Sherando and Varilla series may become competitors as their classification is updated to the eighth edition of Soil Taxonomy.  Sherando soils formed in water sorted materials.  Varilla soils formed in colluvium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hazleton soils developed in residuum from acid gray, brown, or red sandstone and are found on summits, shoulders, and the upper third of backslopes.  Slopes are usually convex with gradients of 0 to 80 percent..  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 60 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F.  The average annual frost free season is 110 to 180 days."

Buchanan, Gilpin, Laidig, and Rayne soils are nearby.  Buchanan, Cookport, and Laidig soils have fragipans.  Gilpin soils have bedrock within 40 inches.  Clymer, Edgemont, and Rayne soils have argillic horizons.  Leetonia soils have spodic horizons."

    "content": "REMARKS: The Hazleton series was in a mixed mineralogy family until 1995.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches (E, Bhs, and Bs horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 34 inches (Bw horizon).\n3. Loamy-skeletal feature - greater than 35 percent by volume weighted average rock fragments in the particle-size control section.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available on the typifying pedon, Pennsylvania State University sample number S1967-PA-062-001(1-11).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
