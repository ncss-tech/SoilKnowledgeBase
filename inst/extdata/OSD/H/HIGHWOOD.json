  "OVERVIEW": "The Highwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from mixed igneous rock sources.  These soils occur on mountain slopes and structural benches.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
