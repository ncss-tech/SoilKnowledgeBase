  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 35 percent in the Ap, BA, and 2Bt horizons, and from 35 to 80 percent in the Bt horizon.  Most of the gravel are 0.25 to 3 inches in diameter.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in each horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Where the Ap horizon is thicker than 6 inches, the color value is 4 or more.   The fine earth fraction is a silt loam.  In severely eroded areas the Ap has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6.  The fine earth fraction is a silty clay loam.\nThe BA horizon, present in most pedons, has colors and textures transitional to that of the Ap and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  The fine earth fraction is a silt clay loam, clay loam, or clay.  The clay content ranges from 35 to 60 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 and 6. Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow, or red.  The fine earth fraction is clay."
