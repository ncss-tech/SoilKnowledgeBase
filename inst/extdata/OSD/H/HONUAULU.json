    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Honuaulu soils are on mid elevation, leeward slopes of Mauna Loa and Hualalai volcanoes at elevations from 305 to 1067 meters (1000 to 3500 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to very steep lava flows that are 5,000 to 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1270 to 2030 millimeters (50 to 80 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 640 to 1020 millimeters (25 to 50 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 16 to 22 degrees C (61 to 71 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
