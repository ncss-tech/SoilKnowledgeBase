  "OVERVIEW": "The Heterwa series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in basaltic and volcanic ash materials and in glacial material from basalt.  These soils are on high plateaus, rolling mesa tops, and flat mountain tops and have slopes ranging from 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 810 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

Endlich and Snotown soils have less than 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  In addition, the Endlich soils have more moisture and longer durations with increased moisture in the soil moisture control section.  Ivywild soils have paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Klootch soils are moderately acid to neutral.   Bensley, Grendier, Henson, Jeru, Koffgo, Leighcan, Marsell, and Oatman soils lack bedrock above 100 cm."
