    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 to 44 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.  The thin A horizon may be missing in some pedons.  The particle-size control section is typically loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with clay ranging from 20 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent in the particle-size control section.  Gravel is dominant but includes a range of 5 to 20 percent cobble and less than 5 percent stone.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The solum is moderately acid through very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon when present has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe E and Bw horizons have colors of the E and Bw horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Textures are loam, sand clay loam or clay loam."

Endlich and Snotown soils have less than 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  In addition, the Endlich soils have more moisture and longer durations with increased moisture in the soil moisture control section.  Ivywild soils have paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Klootch soils are moderately acid to neutral.   Bensley, Grendier, Henson, Jeru, Koffgo, Leighcan, Marsell, and Oatman soils lack bedrock above 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Heterwa soils are on high plateaus and flat mountain tops.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in glacial till and residuum of medium to moderately fine textured material from volcanic basalt flows and ash.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches, the majority of which is received as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 32 to 40 degrees F."

Diagnostic features include low base saturation throughout the profile, a cambic horizon from 18 to 28 inches and a lithic contact at 28 inches.  Last updated by the state 4/94.  Series name is taken from location of typical pedon at headwater areas of the South Fork of White River.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
