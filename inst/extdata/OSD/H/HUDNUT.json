  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches depth is 47 to 50 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.35 to 1.50 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. Solum thickness is 15 to 32 inches. The particle-size control section averages 4 to 12 percent clay , and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Depth to sandy textures is 40 to more than 60 inches. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is 15 to 20 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon is gravelly or cobbly and is 15 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe C1 horizon, when present, has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is gravelly or cobbly and is 15 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe C2 horizon, when present, has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly and has 15 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 25 percent cobbles. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand or sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hudnut soils are on till plains, glacial outwash terraces, and their escarpments. These soils formed in coarse-textured granitic ablation till and glacial outwash with some loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Elevation ranges from 1,800 to 2,700 feet. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F, mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. Frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
