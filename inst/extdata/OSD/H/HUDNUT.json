  "OVERVIEW": "The Hudnut series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in granitic ablation till or glacial outwash with loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Hudnut soils are on till plains, outwash terraces, and terrace escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.35 to 1.50 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. Solum thickness is 15 to 32 inches. The particle-size control section averages 4 to 12 percent clay , and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Depth to sandy textures is 40 to more than 60 inches. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is 15 to 20 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon is gravelly or cobbly and is 15 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe C1 horizon, when present, has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is gravelly or cobbly and is 15 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe C2 horizon, when present, has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly and has 15 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 25 percent cobbles. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand or sand."
