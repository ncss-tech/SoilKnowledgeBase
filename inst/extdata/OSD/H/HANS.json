  "OVERVIEW": "The Hans series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous lake sediments from mixed rocks.  Hans soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. average annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",
