Baller soils have rock fragments mainly of stone and cobble size. Boriana soils have a paralithic contact above a lithic contact. Demayo, Docdee, Oro Grande and Yaquican soils average more than 18 percent clay in the control section. Far soils are slightly acid to strongly acid in the control section in addition to forming on granite and gneiss bedrock. Faraway soils have an aridic ustic soil moisture regime.  Rotagilla soils formed in parent material from monzonite, have mean annual precipitation of 14 to 16 inches And are in an aridic ustic soil moisture regime and should be reclassified in an Aridic Lithic subgroup."

These soils formed in alluvium from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."
