  "OVERVIEW": "The Heuvelton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in lacustrine and marine sediments. They are on gently sloping to steep landforms on lake and marine plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 7 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is 1000 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 51 to 102 cm. Depth to carbonates ranges from 51 to 178 cm. Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent in surface and subsurface horizons, and from 0 to 10 percent below. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral above the Bt horizon, moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the Bt and BC horizons, and neutral to moderately alkaline below.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. The texture of the fine earth is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay. It has weak to strong, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistance is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Faint redox features range from none to common. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, angular, subangular blocky or platy structure. Consistance is very friable to firm.\nThe BE horizon, where present, is similar to the Bt and E horizon in color and consistence, similar to the E horizon in texture, and differs only in size of structure and exhibits less evidence of translocated clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It has both redox accumulations and depletions. In pedons with matrix color of chroma 2 the color is lithochromic and not evidence of aquic conditions. Texture of the fine earth fraction is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam. It has moderate or strong, medium or coarse, angular or subangular blocky structure with or without coarse or very coarse prisms. Consistance is friable, firm or very firm.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that differ from the Bt horizons mainly in containing free carbonates, and is similar to the C horizon in texture. It has mainly coarse or very coarse prismatic structure, but includes blocky structure. It is friable, firm or very firm.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is commonly varved with texture of silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay, and with thin bands of fine sand and very fine sand in varves. It is massive or has platy structure inherited from varving."

Elevation ranges from 30 to 230 meters above sea-level. Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1490 mm.

Elmwood and Swanton soils formed in coarse-loamy materials that overlie clayey lacustrine sediments. In addition, Swanton soils occupy wetter parts of the landscape. The poorly drained Guff and somewhat poorly drained Matoon soils are moderately deep to bedrock. The Insula, Millsite, Quetico and Ruse soils formed in glacial till on nearby bedrock controlled landscapes and are all less than 102 cm deep to bedrock."

Ochric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 28 cm (Ap & BE horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - The zone from 28 to 56 cm (Bt horizon).\n3. Aquic subgroup - The zone from 28 to 53 cm, the upper 10 inches of the argillic, has chroma 2 redoximorphic depletions at 11 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
