  "OVERVIEW": "The Hinker series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, and colluvium and slope alluvium from phyllite.  Hinker soils are on glacially modified mountain shoulder slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Snow cover lasts from November through June.  Mean annual precipitation is 85 to 100 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 56 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 85 to 100 days."
