Deming and Kupreanof soils are deep.  Foad soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 40 to 43 degrees F and a solum 7 to 22 inches thick.  Haywire, Nagrom, Nimue, and Playco soils have more than 5 times as much carbon as free iron in the upper part of the spodic horizon.  Karta, Saar, and Shuksan soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Thader soils are 35 to 70 percent olivine basalt or olivine andesite in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hinker soils are on glacially modified mountain shoulder slopes at elevations of 3,500 to 4,200 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in volcanic ash, loess, colluvium, and slope alluvium from phyllite.  Hinker soils are in a marine climate with cool, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Snow cover lasts from November through June.  Mean annual precipitation is 85 to 100 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 56 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 85 to 100 days."

Clendenen soils are shallow to a paralithic contact with dense compact glacial till.  Crinker, Kindy, and Springsteen soils have less than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 10 centimeters of the spodic horizon.  Also, Kindy soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact with dense compact glacial till.  Edfro soils are shallow and serpentinitic."
