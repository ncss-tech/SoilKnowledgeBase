The depth to horizons that have either mottles with chroma of 2 or less or a matrix with chroma of 2 or less with mottles is greater than 20 inches but less than 40 inches.  The series control section contains less than 2 percent rock fragments.  The particle size control section is commonly fine sand or sand with 5 to 15 percent coarse sand and coarser.  The reaction of the series control section is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sand.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It commonly is fine sand or sand but ranges to loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sand or sand.  It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

Aylmer and Poppleton soils have a pH of 6 or higher throughout the series control section.  Lino soils are substantially wetter in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice and contain less than 5 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle size control section. Meehan soils have more than 30 percent medium sand and coarser in the series control section.  Poppleton and Redby soils do not have a control section that is strongly acid or moderately acid throughout and have mottles at less than 20 inches.  Winterfield soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with increasing depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hiwood soils have convex slopes with gradient of 0 to 12 percent on glacial lake plains, and outwash plains.  They formed in deep sandy sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches.  Frost-free days range from 88 to 135.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet."

The poorly and very poorly drained Cormant soils and the somewhat poorly drained Redby soils formed in sediments similar to those of the Hiwood soils and are members of a hydrosequence with the Hiwood soils.  Very poorly drained Deerwood and Markey soils formed in organic materials over sand and are in lower lying areas."
