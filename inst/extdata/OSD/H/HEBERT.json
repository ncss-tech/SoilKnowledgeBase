  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 36 to 72 inches. The effective cation exchange capacity is 20 to 50 percent, saturated with exchangeable aluminum in the control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon typically has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. In subhorizons of some pedons it has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some of the peds have 1 or 2 chroma silt coats that are as thick as 1 mm. Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Sand content ranges from 10 to 20 percent, dominanted by very fine sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in all parts of the Bt horizon, but it is typically very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part and moderately acid or slightly acid in the lower part.\nThe BC and C horizons have the same color range as the Bt horizon. Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. In some pedons the C horizon is stratified. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Acy, Dundee, Essen, Frozard, Galvez, Idee, McGehee, Norene, and Potoutville series in the same family and the Gallion, Hillemann, and Rilla series in similar families. Acy, Frozard, Galvez and Idee soils have Bt horizons with browner hues. Dundee, Essen, Hilleman, Norene, and Patoutville soils have hues yellower than 7.5YR and lack the prominent silt coatings. In addition, Essen soils are alkaline. Hillemann soils have sodium accumulations in the lower part of the B horizon, and Patoutville soils have less than 10 percent total sand and have red mottles. Gallion soils lack the prominent silt coatings, lack the gray ped surfaces and are not as acid. McGehee soils have thin silt coatings in the upper B horizons but are underlain by acid clay which lacks the prominent silt coatings. Rilla soils lack 1 or 2 chroma silt coats on peds."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hebert soils occur mainly on level to gently sloping natural levees along present and abandoned channels of the Arkansas River. The water table is at a depth of 36 inches or less for periods up to 1 month duration mostly in winter and spring. The soil formed in silty alluvium of mixed mineralogy. The climate is warm and humid. Average annual rainfall ranges from 45 to 55 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F. P-E index ranges from 68 to 74."
