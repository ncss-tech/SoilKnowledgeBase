  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 12 to 26 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches and extends into the Bw horizon.  The control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay.  Bulk density of the C horizon is 1.25 to 1.40. The thickness of stratified meltwater deposits ranges from 40 inches to many feet over loamy glacial till.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam.  Some pedons are fine sandy loam when mantled by a thin layer of sandy aeolian material.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, values of 6 or 7, and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is loam, but is silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has common or many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonates.  Some pedons have fine to medium concretions of carbonate.  Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum.\nThe C horizon is multicolored and has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 6 or 7, and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is stratified silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, and fine sandy loam, but some pedons have stratifications of loamy very fine sand, fine sand, or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has common or many, fine to coarse, faint to distinct redox features which mainly are inherent in the glacial meltwater sediments.  Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum in the lower part.  Carbonate typically is disseminated in the C horizon, but some pedons contain accumulations and concretions in the upper part."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hand soils are nearly level to rolling on glacial outwash plains.  Surfaces are plane or convex; slopes are short and irregular; and slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in stratified loamy meltwater deposits overlying loam or clay loam glacial till.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 26 inches."

Clarno, Houdek, Blendon, Delmont, Enet, and Henkin soils are on similar landscapes. Blendon and Henkin soils are coarse-loamy.  In addition, Blendon soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 20 inches.  Delmont and Enet soils are underlain by sand and gravel at depths less than 40 inches.  Betts soils lack mollic epipedons and are on steeper landscapes.  Bonilla and Prosper soils are in swales and have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  In addition, Prosper and Houdek soils have argillic horizons.  Crossplain and Tetonka soils are in the fine family and are in swales and closed depressions.  Davison soils are on slight rises adjacent to swales and depressions and have calcic horizons within 16 inches of the surface.  Ethan soils usually are on steeper, convex parts of the landscape, have thinner sola, and are calcareous at depths of less than 10 inches."
