  "OVERVIEW": "The Harbord series consists of very deep, well drained, medium permeable soils that formed in tertiary sediments capped by a thin layer of loess.  These soils are on gently sloping to rolling uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degree F.",
