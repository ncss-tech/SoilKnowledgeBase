  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic and volcanic rocks.  Hoot soils are on crests, ridges, summits, and side slopes of hills, mountains and plateaus. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Etinarg soils average 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Downeyville soils also have carbonate coated rock fragments in the argillic horizon and effervescent Btk horizons.  Mirkwood and Vium soils also have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in particle-size control section.  Theon soils also lack A2 horizons.  Waucoba soils also have an argillic horizon that is effervescent.  Tognoni soils have abrupt AB horizon boundaries.  Valleycity soils are effervescent throughout their profile and have mainly stones and cobbles in the particle-size control section."
