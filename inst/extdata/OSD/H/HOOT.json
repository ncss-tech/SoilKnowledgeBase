Etinarg soils average 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Downeyville soils also have carbonate coated rock fragments in the argillic horizon and effervescent Btk horizons.  Mirkwood and Vium soils also have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in particle-size control section.  Theon soils also lack A2 horizons.  Waucoba soils also have an argillic horizon that is effervescent.  Tognoni soils have abrupt AB horizon boundaries.  Valleycity soils are effervescent throughout their profile and have mainly stones and cobbles in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic and volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 600 to 1,800 meters and as high as 2,100 meters on southerly aspects.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
