  "OVERVIEW": "The Hartig series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Hartig soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature 6 degrees C.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hartig soils are on plateaus and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, dacite, rhyolite, and tuff.  Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 1,524 to 2,122 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
