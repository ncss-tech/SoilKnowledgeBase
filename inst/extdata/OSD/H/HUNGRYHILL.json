  "REVDATE": "02/2012",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hungryhill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills and ridges of structural benches.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 432 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
