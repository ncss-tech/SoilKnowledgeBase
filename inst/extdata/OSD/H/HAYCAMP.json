  "OVERVIEW": "The Haycamp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from interbeded sandstone and shale.  Haycamp soils are on mountain slopes and canyons.  Slopes range from 30 to 80 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
