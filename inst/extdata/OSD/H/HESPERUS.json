  "OVERVIEW": "The Hesperus series consists of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, residuum, or eolian material derived from mixed sources.  Hesperus soils are on drainageways, alluvial fans, structural benches, terraces, mountain slopes, and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",

All pedons of Hesperus where the parent material is colluvium, residuum, or eolian deposits and the landforms are mountain slopes and hills and the percent slope is greater than 25 percent should be removed from the Hesperus concept.\nHesperus soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime with a typic subclass.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
