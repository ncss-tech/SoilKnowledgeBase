All pedons of Hesperus where the parent material is colluvium, residuum, or eolian deposits and the landforms are mountain slopes and hills and the percent slope is greater than 25 percent should be removed from the Hesperus concept.\nHesperus soils have a frigid temperature regime and are in an ustic soil moisture regime with a typic subclass.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
