  "OVERVIEW": "The Harding series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits from sandstone, limestone and shale. The Harding soils are on lake plains, lake terraces, and flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F.",
