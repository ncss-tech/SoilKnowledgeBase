The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 59 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section between the depths of 8 and 16 inches is dry in all parts from about mid July to mid October (about 85 to 95 days).  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about mid March to late December (about 280 to 300 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about mid April to late November.  Base saturation ranges from 75 to 85 percent (sum of cations) in the upper 30 inches of the profile.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, or 3/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 3/2.   It is loam or gravelly loam.  It has 20 to 27 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, or 3/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4, or 3/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 3/2 to 20 inches or more.  It is gravelly clay loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam, clay loam, or very gravelly clay loam.  The Bt horizon has 15 to 35 percent gravel in the upper part, but may have up to 65 percent gravel in lower part.  It has 25 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 8 percent more clay than the A horizon."

The Adieux, Lonkey, and Waha soils are 20 to 40 inches deep over a lithic contact.  The Banning soils have mottles in the A and B horizons, and are somewhat poorly drained.  The Blockhouse, Coolbrith, Dotta, Drews, Henhill, Pumphouse, Robinette, Van Dusen and Wapinitia soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 52 degrees F.  Gorman soils are dry for 180 to 195 days when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  Henhill and Pumphouse soils have Bk horizons.  Harriman soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Supan soils are 40 to 60 inches deep over a lithic contact and have 7.5YR and 5YR colors."
