The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 59 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section between the depths of 8 and 16 inches is dry in all parts from about mid July to mid October (about 85 to 95 days).  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about mid March to late December (about 280 to 300 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about mid April to late November.  Base saturation ranges from 75 to 85 percent (sum of cations) in the upper 30 inches of the profile.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, or 3/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 3/2.   It is loam or gravelly loam.  It has 20 to 27 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, or 3/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4, or 3/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3 or 3/2 to 20 inches or more.
