  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hangmans series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or residuum derived from hard sedimentary rock. These soils occur on hills, ridges and structural benches.  Slopes are 8 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
