    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates is 0 to 10 inches and occurs in all parts between 10 and 20 inches. The mineral soil contains 0 to 15 percent rock fragments of mixed lithology. The organic soil is herbaceous.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2. In some pedons up to 4 inches of mucky peat (hemic material) is included. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam and the mucky analogues. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bkg or Bg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 25 to 40 percent Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe BCdg has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  Texture is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 25 to 40 percent.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.70 to 1.85 g/cc.  Primary structure is dominantly fractures in the till matrix and platy fragments.\nThe Cdg has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Chroma of 3 may be present in the lower, denser portion of the horizon.  This color may also occur on ped interiors with lower chroma occurring on exteriors and along fracture faces.  It has textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It has 12 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.75 to 2.00 g/cc.\nSome pedons have a Cd with chroma of 3."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Haug soils have plane or slightly concave slopes with\ngradient of 0 to 1 percent on lake plains and ground moraines. These soils formed in a thin layer of organic soil material over calcareous, loamy glacial till or lacustrine deposits. The mean annual air temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 28 inches. Frost-free days range from 88 to 135. Elevation above sea level ranges from 750 to 1,350 feet."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity, measured in inches per hour, is .6 to 2 in the upper profile and .06 to .6 in the lower part (Cdg horizon).  Depth to an apparent seasonal high saturation is at the surface during periods of snow melt and/or heavy rainfall periods.  Surface ponding occurs typically in spring and fall during normal years."
