  "OVERVIEW": "The Hetz series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly, and poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Hetz soils are in wet drainageways, valley bottoms.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
