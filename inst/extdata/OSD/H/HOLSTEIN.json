  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  The coarse fragment content of the solum ranges from 1 to 10 percent except in the A horizon that ranges to as much as 15 percent and contains most of the fragments 3 inches or more in size.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4 in the upper part and hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6 in the lower part.  Some pedons have thin A1 horizons of dark brown (10YR 3/3) or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) that have value of 4 upon mixing to depths of 7 inches.  The A horizon is loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam. Reaction is medium acid to slightly acid.\nThe B horizon horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 8. Mottles in the lower parts of the B horizon are 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. The B1 horizon is loam or clay loam. The B2t horizon is clay loam in the upper part and clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam in the lower part. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages between 27 and 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. The B horizons range from very strongly acid through medium acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Britwater, Negley, Pomme, and Sonora series. Britwater soils contain considerably more coarse fragments in the upper parts of the sola and more than 35 percent in all parts below depths of about 30 inches.  Negley soils have stratification in the solum and contain rounded pebbles of mixed mineralogy in the solum and as much as 25 percent in some parts of the B horizon.  Pomme and Sonora soils are semiactive.  In addition, Sonora soils have argillic horizons formed in loamy materials in the upper part and materials weathered from colluvium of sandstones and shales in the lower part, and are semiactive."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Holstein soils are on uplands generally in foot slope positions that lie below exposures of sandstone bedrock and above the lowland terraces and recent alluvial bottom lands.  They formed in colluvium or residuum weathered from a mixture of sandstone, limestone, and shale.  Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 45 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gasconade, Goss, Menfro, and Winfield soils on the uplands and the Cedargap soils on the adjacent narrow floodplains.  Gasconade and Goss soils occupy positions above or below Holstein soils. Gasconade soils have mollic epipedons and a lithic contact at depths of 10 to 20 inches. Goss soils have clayey-skeletal argillic horizons. Menfro and Winfield soils are on higher positions in the landscape and are fine-silty. Cedargap soils are loamy-skeletal."
