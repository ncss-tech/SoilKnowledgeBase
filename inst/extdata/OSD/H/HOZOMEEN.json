  "OVERVIEW": "The Hozomeen series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils formed in local alpine glacial till, colluvium, loess, and volcanic ash.  Hozomeen soils are on glacially modified mountain backslopes and have slopes of 20 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 80 to 95 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
