    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in local alpine glacial till, colluvium, loess, and volcanic ash.  Hozomeen soils are in a cold marine climate with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Snow cover lasts from December through April.  Average annual precipitation is 80 to 95 inches, mean January temperature is 31 degrees F, mean July temperature is 58 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
