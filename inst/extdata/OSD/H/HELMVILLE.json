  "OVERVIEW": "The Helmville series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from limestone, argillite, and igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
