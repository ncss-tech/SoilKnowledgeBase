  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from about 30 to 60 inches. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in each horizon, except where limed. Fragments of chert gravel range from 15 percent to 35 percent in the A, and Bt horizons, from 35 to 60 percent in the BC, and from 35 to 80 percent in the C horizons. A 2Bt horizon is common in many pedons and, where present, fragments range the same as the Bt horizon. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Some pedons have a discontinuous A horizon with value of 3 and chroma of 3, and are less than 7 inches thick. Texture is gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR and rarely 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is gravelly silt loam, gravelly loam, gravelly silty clay loam, or gravelly clay loam. In some pedons, few to common brownish and yellowish mottles are present.\nThe BC and C horizon has the range of colors given for the Bt horizon. Texture of the fine earth fraction is extremely variable and includes silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, sandy loam, and loamy coarse sand. Few to many yellowish and brownish mottles, and grayish redoximorphic depletions are in the C horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon, where present, has colors and texture similar to the Bt horizon. Few to many mottles and redoximorphic depletions are present in this horizon."

The Marsh soils are on steep hillsides of the Nashville Basin and formed in colluvium and residuum from thinly bedded sandy limestone interbedded with shale and siltstone. The Pamunkey soils formed in Piedmont and Coastal Plain sediments"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Humphreys soils are on low stream terraces, alluvial fans, and on footslopes. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent slopes. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from soils developed mainly in cherty limestone residuum, but in many places it contains materials from siltstone and shale. Near the type location mean annual temperature is 57.5 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation is 55.1 inches."

The Minvale and Pickwick soils have thicker sola and the Trace soils have less than 10 percent fragments in the argillic horizon. The Nolin, Arrington, Cannon, Ennis, Lindside, Hamblen, and Lobelville series are on adjacent floodplains, and lack an argillic horizon. The Minvale and Dellrose series are on footslopes and have thicker sola."
