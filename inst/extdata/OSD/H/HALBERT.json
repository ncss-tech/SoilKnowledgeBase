The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 7 degrees F. The A and Bg horizons have moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.80 g/cc. The histic epipedon is 8 to 16 inches thick. Depth to the placic horizon is 12 to 20 inches from the mineral surface. The mineral soil is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. This horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure. It is very strongly acid or extremely acid. It has 10 to 20 percent organic matter. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2. It has 2 to 10 percent organic matter. It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay and 50 to 70 percent silt.\nThe Bsm horizon (placic horizon) has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. Indurated iron, manganese and organic matter cemented pan.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 0 through 2. It is silty clay loam or silty clay.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Halbert soils are in depressions and along low-gradient streams on glacial outwash terraces and till plains. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. These soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments deposited over piedmont glacial outwash from the Olympic Mountains. Elevations range from 50 to 300 feet. They are in a humid marine climate with cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers. Mean precipitation is 80 to 120 inches. The mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 59 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 220 days."
