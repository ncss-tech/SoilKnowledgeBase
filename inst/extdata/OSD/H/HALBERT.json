  "REVDATE": "08/2007",
  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Halbert series consists of shallow, very poorly drained soils that formed in silty glaciolacustrine sediments over glacial outwash. Halbert soils are in depressions on glacial outwash terraces and till plains and have 0 to 10 percent slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
