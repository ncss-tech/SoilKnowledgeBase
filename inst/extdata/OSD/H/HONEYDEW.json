  "OVERVIEW": "The Honeydew series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from sedimentary rock. Honeydew soils are on mountain sideslopes and narrow ridges and have slopes of 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

The soil between the depths of 5 and 31 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to September 15, and is moist in all parts from December 1 to April 15.  The particle-size control section (5 to 25 inches) averages from 19 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction of the solum is slightly to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4. Only the upper 1 to 5 inches have moist values and chromas of 3 or less.  It is gravelly or very gravelly loam.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 7/4 or 7.5YR 5/6, 6/4, 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4, 4/6 or 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/6.  It is very gravelly clay loam, and extremely gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 80 percent.
