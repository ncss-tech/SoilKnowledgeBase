The soil between the depths of 5 and 31 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to September 15, and is moist in all parts from December 1 to April 15.  The particle-size control section (5 to 25 inches) averages from 19 to 35 percent clay.  Reaction of the solum is slightly to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4. Only the upper 1 to 5 inches have moist values and chromas of 3 or less.  It is gravelly or very gravelly loam.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 7/4 or 7.5YR 5/6, 6/4, 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4, 4/6 or 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/6.  It is very gravelly clay loam, and extremely gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 80 percent.  Base saturation by Hach kit (sum of cations), ranges from 11 to 28 percent."
