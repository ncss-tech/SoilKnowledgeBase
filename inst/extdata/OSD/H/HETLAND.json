  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 30 inches.  The mollic epipedon extends into or includes all of the Bt horizon.  Depth to calcium carbonate ranges from 16 to 32 inches. The upper 2/3 of the series control section averages between 35 and 45 percent clay and contains less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has color value of 3 or 4 (2 or 3 moist) and chroma of 1 or less.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 (2 to 5 moist) and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 (4 to 6 moist); and chroma of 1 to 4.  Most pedons have relic mottles with considerable variation in degree and intensity.  Few or common, fine to coarse masses of calcium\ncarbonate are present.  Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 7 (4 to 6 moist); and chroma of 1 to 4.  Relic mottles vary in degree and intensity.  Few to common fine masses of calcium carbonate are in the C horizon of most pedons.  The C horizon typically is silty clay loam or silt loam, but some pedons contain thin strata of coarser material. Some pedons have distinct laminations.  The reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

The soil formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments in ice-walled lakes on uplands.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation from 20 to 24 inches.   Growing season is about 120 to 140 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 2900."

All except the Sinai soils are on adjacent slopes and typically are at a lower elevation than the Hetland soils.  The Barnes and Buse soils are fine-loamy.  The Poinsett and Waubay soils are fine-silty.  The Sinai soils have cracks in most years that are 1/2 inch or more wide at 20 inches, are at least 12 inches long, and extend upward to the base of the Ap horizon and are in positions on the landscape similar to those of the Hetland soils."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 inches (Ap and Bt horizons); argillic horizon - 8 to 23 inches (Bt horizon); Pachic feature - a mollic over 16 inches thick, Vertic features - a linear extensibility of more than 6 cm in the upper 100 cm.\nThis soil may fit into the Oxyaquic Vertic subgroup if soil saturation occurs above a depth of 40 inches.  Presently the redox features are considered as relic.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
