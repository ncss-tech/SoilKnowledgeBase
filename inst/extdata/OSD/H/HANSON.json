  "OVERVIEW": "The Hanson series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and glacial till derived from limestone rock.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, mountain slopes, hills and moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
