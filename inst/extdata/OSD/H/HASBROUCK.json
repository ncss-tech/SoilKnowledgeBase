  "STATES": "NJ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hasbrouck series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils in depressions on uplands.  They typically formed from eroded and redeposited glacial materials overlying till.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum above the fragipan, moderately low or low in the fragipan, and moderately high or high in the substratum.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness commonly ranges from 51 to 127 cm. Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 40 to 76 cm.  Depth to red shale, sandstone, or basalt bedrock is typically more than 3 meters below the surface.  Rock fragment content in the solum above a lithologic discontinuity, where present, ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume.  Rock fragment content in the fragipan and the C horizon commonly ranges from 15 to 50 percent by volume but the range in the fragipan ranges as low as 4 percent.  Rock fragments larger than 8 cm in diameter, range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the solum and from 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid in the solum above the fragipan, from moderately acid through slightly acid in the fragipan, and from slightly acid through mildly alkaline in the C horizon.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E or Eg horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles with higher value and chroma are few or common.  Texture ranges from sandy loam to silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BEg horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features with higher chroma are common or many.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features with higher chroma are common or many. Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Clay content dominantly is between 20 and 30 percent.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 8.  Texture is commonly loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Clay content dominantly is between 10 and 20 percent. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or thick platy, and may be within weak coarse prisms.  Ped coat colors are one or two units of value higher than ped interiors.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R through 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 6.  Texture is dominantly sandy loam but ranges from loamy sand to loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Clay content is less than 10 percent.  The C horizon is massive, but may have weak, very thick platy layers in the upper 60 cm.  Consistence is friable or firm."

Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in eroded and redeposited glacial materials on till of Wisconsin Age. The till materials are composed primarily of red shales, red sandstone, and basalt."

The well drained Netcong soils, which do not have a fragipan, are on sideslopes of uplands.  The well drained Holyoke and Yalesville soils are shallow and moderately deep soils on hills and ridges. The poorly or very poorly drained Preakness soils are on adjacent outwash plains and terraces."

Geographical location and coordinates could not be reliably determined from the described location.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 14 inches (A, Eg and BEg horizons).\n2.  Argillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 24 inches (Btg horizon).\n3.  Fragipan - the zone from 24 to 42 inches (Bx horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
