  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hardnut soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite or tuff with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,980 to 2,565 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
