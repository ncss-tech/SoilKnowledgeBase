  "OVERVIEW": "The Herakle series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from limestone and/or sandstone.  These soils are on mountain slopes and hogbacks with slopes of 5 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees.",
