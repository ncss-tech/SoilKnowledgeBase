Content of coarse fragments by weighted average in the control section ranges from 35 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, moist value of 3 or 4, and moist chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe 1C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, moist value of 3 or 5, and moist chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand, with or without gravel.\nThe 2C horizon has the same color ranges as the IC horizon. It is gravelly or very gravelly coarse sand, or gravelly or very gravelly loamy sand, with thin layers of finer textures occurring at random."
