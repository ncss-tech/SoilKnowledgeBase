Agnos, Frankstown, Groseclose and Mertz soils have mixed mineralogy.  Christian soils have kaolinitic minerology.  Edom, Hagerstown and Duffield soils have more than 35 percent base saturation.  GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hublersburg soils are on nearly level to steep convex upland slopes. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  They formed in residuum weathered from cherty limestone.  Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 45 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F., and the frost free season ranges from 140 to 180 days."
