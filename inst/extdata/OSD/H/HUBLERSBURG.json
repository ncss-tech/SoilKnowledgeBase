Rock fragments, dominantly of chert but also of sandstone and shale, range from 2 to 25 percent by volume in individual horizons.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the soil unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Fine-earth texture is silt loam.  Some eroded pedons are silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  Fine-earth texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Agnos, Christian, Duffield, Edom, Frankstown, Groseclose, Hagerstown and Mertz are related fields.  Agnos, Frankstown, Groseclose and Mertz soils have mixed mineralogy.  Christian soils have kaolinitic minerology.  Edom, Hagerstown and Duffield soils have more than 35 percent base saturation.  GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hublersburg soils are on nearly level to steep convex upland slopes. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  They formed in residuum weathered from cherty limestone.  Climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 45 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F., and the frost free season ranges from 140 to 180 days."

Eliber soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the textural control section.  Evendale, Penlaw and Newark soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Morrison soils have less than 35 percent clay in the textural control section.  Opequon soils have more than 35 percent base saturation.  Melvin and Thorndale soils are poorly drained.  Nolin soils do not have an argillic horizon.\nDRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY.  Well drained.  Surface runoff is medium to very rapid.  Permeability is moderate."
