    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk, Bky, By1, By2 and Cy horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 8 to 25 inches.  (Bk and Bky horizons)\nGypsic horizon:  The zone from 14 to 44 inches.  (Bky, By1, By2 and Cy horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with shale at 44 inches.  (Cr horizon)\nRemarks:  National Soil Survey Laboratory sample S95UT-015-003.\nThe wide range of soil color in the lower profile reflects the light gray to red colors of the shale layers of the parent material.  A lithologic discontinuity is not recognized in this series due to the inherent interbedded nature of the parent material.  The Cy horizon typically effervesces slowly for a long period of time as does the shale bedrock.\nThe lab data indicates that Humbug is well into fine-gypseous particle size class, however, other field data may indicate coarse-gypseous.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh  Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
