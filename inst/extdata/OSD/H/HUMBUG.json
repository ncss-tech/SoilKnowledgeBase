  "OVERVIEW": "The Humbug series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and eolian deposits overlying residuum derived from interbedded sandstone, shale and gypsum bedrock.  Humbug soils are on rolling shale hills and structural benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk, Bky, By1, By2 and Cy horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 8 to 25 inches.  (Bk and Bky horizons)\nGypsic horizon:  The zone from 14 to 44 inches.  (Bky, By1, By2 and Cy horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with shale at 44 inches.  (Cr horizon)\nRemarks:  National Soil Survey Laboratory sample S95UT-015-003.\nThe wide range of soil color in the lower profile reflects the light gray to red colors of the shale layers of the parent material.  A lithologic discontinuity is not recognized in this series due to the inherent interbedded nature of the parent material.  The Cy horizon typically effervesces slowly for a long period of time as does the shale bedrock.\nThe lab data indicates that Humbug is well into fine-gypseous particle size class, however, other field data may indicate coarse-gypseous.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh  Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
