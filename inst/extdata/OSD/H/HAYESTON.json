  "OVERVIEW": "The Hayeston series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Hayeston soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, beach terraces, and beach plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
