  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The upper 20 to 36 inches are silty clay, clay or silty clay loam (see remarks).  Vertical tongues 1/2 to 2 inches wide of sandy or coarser soil fill old cracks to depths greater than 20 inches.  Unfilled soil cracks range from 1 mm to greater than 1 cm wide at a depth of 20 inches or more.  The material below the clay or silty clay is dominantly loamy very fine sand, but some thick strata are silt loam to loamy fine sand.  Strata as much as 1 inch thick of contrasting texture are in both the fine-textured upper layers and the coarse-textured lower layers.\nIt is usually massive, but some pedons have platy structure because of stratification.  The soil is dominantly moderately alkaline, but some pedons have strata that are strongly alkaline.  It is calcareous throughout with disseminated lime, and has soft threads and masses of gypsum in some pedons.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 7.5YR 4/4, or 5/4.\nC horizons have similar colors and also dry color of 10YR 7/3 or 7.5YR 7/4.  Some thin strata or on fracture or structural planes a hue of 5YR occurs. Some pedons below 40 inches have fine sand."

The Holtville soils formed in mixed and stratified alluvium and lacustrine sediments. The mean annual precipitation is less than 4 inches, the mean January temperature is 50 degrees F., the mean July temperature 90 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature 76 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 300 to 360days."
