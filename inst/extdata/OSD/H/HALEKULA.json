  "OVERVIEW": "The Halekula series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils.  These soils formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 890 millimeters (35 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to very steep `a`a lava flows that are 3,000 to 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 760 to 1020 millimeters (30 to 40 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from January through July.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
