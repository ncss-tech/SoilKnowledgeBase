  "OVERVIEW": "The Holly series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high through high in the mineral soil. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 through 44 inches. Thickness of loamy alluvium over other materials ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. The average clay content in the particle size control section ranges from 18 through 30 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4 (6 or more dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Structure is commonly weak or moderate, fine to coarse, granular. In some pedons structure type is subangular blocky. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 through 10 percent by volume. It ranges from strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 2 or less. It commonly is silt loam or loam and less commonly sandy loam or silty clay loam. Thin layers (less than 4 inches) with coarser or finer texture are present in some pedons. Structure is weak or moderate, fine through coarse, subangular blocky. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 through 15 percent by volume. It ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the upper part and from moderately acid through neutral in the lower part.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY or is neutral, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. It commonly is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or clay loam. Below 40 inches the soil typically is stratified and includes textures of loamy sand, sand, or their gravelly analogues. Thin strata of silty clay loam are in some pedons. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 through 25 percent by volume. It ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Holly soils are on broad flat areas and in slight depressions on flood plains receiving alluvium from upland areas of low-lime drift and noncalcareous sandstone and shale. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent. Elevation ranges from 570 through 1,170 feet above mean sea level. Mean annual precipitation is 29 through 43 inches, and mean annual temperature is 47 through 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 through 198 days."

Wayland soils with dark surfaces and Carlisle or Willette soils that formed in organic materials typically are in deeper depressions in the landscape. The well drained Chagrin soils, moderately well drained Lobdell soils, and somewhat poorly drained Orrville soils are in a toposequence with Holly soils, all are in higher floodplain positions than the low lying Holly soils. Chili, Fitchville, Sebring, and Wheeling soils have argillic horizons and are on terraces of nearby landscapes. In addition, Chili and Wheeling soils formed in stratified outwash materials, and Fitchville and Sebring soils formed in lacustrine sediments. The Linden series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvial sediments washed from nearby uplands that are underlain by red and brown shales, sandstones, and in some areas, conglomerate. The Middlebury series consists of very deep, moderately well drained nearly level soils formed in recent alluvium. These soils are on flood plains."
