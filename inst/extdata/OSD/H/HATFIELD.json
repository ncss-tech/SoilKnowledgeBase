Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow or very slow in the lower part. The potential for surface water runoff is low or medium. In drained areas, depth to an intermittent perched high water table is 0.15 to 0.6 meters (0.5 to 2.0 feet) from December through April in most years. On flood-plain steps, this soil is subject to rare periods of flooding."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic surface and subsurface horizons recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon- the zone from 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches) (Ap horizon); 2) Argillic horizon- the zone from 18 to 198 cm (7 to 78 inches) (Bt, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg/Bx, Btx1, Btx2 horizons); 3) Fragic soil properties- the zone from 91 to 198 cm (36 to 78 inches) (Btx part of Btg/Btx, Btx1, Btx2 horizons); and 4) Redoximorphic features- from 18 to 198 cm (7 to 78 inches).\nIn 1995 and 1996, investigations of the Weinbach soils were made in subsets correlated in Indiana. It is determined that the Weinbach soils in Indiana do not have a fragipan, but do have fragic soil properties in the series control section. The type location for the Weinbach series will be moved to an area that will reflect soils that have a fragipan. This soil is correlated as Weinbach soil in the 1969 Perry Co. Soil Survey and as Weinbach soils in adjacent subset soil surveys in Indiana.\nRepresentative component and horizon data is in DMU# 358345."
