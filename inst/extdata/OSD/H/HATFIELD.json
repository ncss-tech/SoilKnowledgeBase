Mean annual temperature is from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is from 1016 to 1193 mm (40 to 47 inches). Frost-free period range from 170 to 210 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 137 meters (340 to 450 feet)."

The well drained Elkinsville and Millstone soils and the moderately well drained Sciotoville soils are on slightly higher lying treads and on risers of stream terraces. The poorly drained Ginat soils are on broad treads of stream terraces and in depressions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and low to moderately high (0.07 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow or very slow in the lower part. The potential for surface water runoff is low or medium. In drained areas, depth to an intermittent perched high water table is 0.15 to 0.6 meters (0.5 to 2.0 feet) from December through April in most years. On flood-plain steps, this soil is subject to rare periods of flooding."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic surface and subsurface horizons recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon- the zone from 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches) (Ap horizon); 2) Argillic horizon- the zone from 18 to 198 cm (7 to 78 inches) (Bt, Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, Btg/Bx, Btx1, Btx2 horizons); 3) Fragic soil properties- the zone from 91 to 198 cm (36 to 78 inches) (Btx part of Btg/Btx, Btx1, Btx2 horizons); and 4) Redoximorphic features- from 18 to 198 cm (7 to 78 inches).\nIn 1995 and 1996, investigations of the Weinbach soils were made in subsets correlated in Indiana. It is determined that the Weinbach soils in Indiana do not have a fragipan, but do have fragic soil properties in the series control section. The type location for the Weinbach series will be moved to an area that will reflect soils that have a fragipan. This soil is correlated as Weinbach soil in the 1969 Perry Co. Soil Survey and as Weinbach soils in adjacent subset soil surveys in Indiana.\nRepresentative component and horizon data is in DMU# 358345.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data on pedon number 96-IN123-001 (typical pedon) and 96-IN123-002 (rarely flooded phase) is at the NSSC, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
