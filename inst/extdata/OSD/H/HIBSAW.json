  "OVERVIEW": "The Hibsaw series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, slowly permeable saline soils. They formed in material weathered from loamy and clayey alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils are on smooth, broad, flood plains of the major streams in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 889 mm (35 in). Mean annual temperature is 15.6 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
