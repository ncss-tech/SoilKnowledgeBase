  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Sullivan series in this family. Iulus, Iuka, Laneville, Marietta, Owentown, Thenas, and Tuscosso series are in closely related families. All of these soils except Tuscosso have colors with hue yellower than 5YR, and are formed in sediments that do not contain appreciable amounts of glauconite. In addition, Tuscosso soils have a fine textured control section. Also, Iuka, Iulus, Owentown, and Thenas soils have a coarse-loamy control section. Laneville and Marietta soils have redox depletions within 24 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hannahatchee soils are on nearly level flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. These soils formed in loamy alluvium high in glauconite, derived mainly from the Weches formation or a glauconitic member of the Reklaw formation. Average annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F. Frost free days range from 235 to 260 and elevation ranges from 90 to 180 feet above sea level. The annual rainfall ranges from 40 to 50 inches and the Thornthwaite P-E indices exceeds 64."

Alto, Cuthbert, Nacogdoches, Redsprings, Ulto, and Trawick soils all have an argillic horizon and are on higher surrounding uplands."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for pasture, but some areas are in woodland. Native pastures are the most common use, but some improved pastures have bahiagrass, improved bermudagrass, or common bermudagrass. Some pastures are overseeded with legumes. Woodland areas produce lobolly or shortleaf pine mixed with oak, gum, and hickory. Native grasses include Florida paspalum, wildrye, switchgrass, various panicums and longleaf uniola."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly classified as Alluvial soils. The mineralogy was changed from mixed to siliceous in January, 1993 based on laboratory data from NSSL. Activity class was assigned to active in February 2000 based on data fron NSSL samples and comparison with associated soils. The series was updated in 2004 to recognize an apparent water table at 4 to 6 feet deep based on wetness studies and observations in Marion-Cass Counties, and Nacogdoches County Texas.\nDiagnostic Horizons and Features in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon --0 to 9 inches\nCambic horizon --9 to 80 inches"
