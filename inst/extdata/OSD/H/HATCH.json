  "OVERVIEW": "The Hatch series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from shale and siltstone on mountainsides and benches.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is about 36 to 42 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is about 54 to 58 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist in some part between a depth of 4 and 12 inches.  The upper 6 inches, after mixing, has a color value, moist, of less than 4.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or clay and has 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It ranges from silt loam or gravelly silt loam to silty clay or gravelly silty clay.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered shale or siltstone."
