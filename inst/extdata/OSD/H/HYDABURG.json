  "OVERVIEW": "The Hydaburg series consists of shallow, very poorly drained soils formed in moderately decomposed sedge peat overlying bedrock. Hydaburg soils are alpine soils on backslopes of hills and valley sides.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 120 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 13 to 20 inches.  The surface tier is dominantly hemic, with a thin layer of fibric soil at the surface.  The subsurface tier is dominantly hemic.  pH is less than 4.5 (0.01M CaCl2) throughout the profile.  The soil does not freeze below a depth of 2 inches in most years due to maritime influence.\nThe C horizon has hue ranging from 5YR to 2.5Y, value moist ranges from 2 to 6, and chroma moist from 1 to 8.  The texture is commonly silt loam, but ranges to include very fine sandy loam and loam. Coarse fragment content ranges from 10 to 60 percent."

The climate is humid maritime with an average annual precipitation of about 120 inches.  Snow remains on the ground from 6 to 8 months of the year.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is below 46 degrees F.  Elevation is typically greater than 1800 feet."
