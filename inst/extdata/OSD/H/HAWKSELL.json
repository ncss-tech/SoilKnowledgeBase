    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nSeries control section:  The zone from 0 to 150 cm.\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 25 to 100 cm  (part of Bk, part of C horizons).\nOchric epipedon:  from 0 to 18 cm  (A horizon).\nCambic horizon:  from 18 to 66 cm  (Bw and Bk horizons).\nSecondary carbonates: from 51 to 66 cm (Bk horizons).\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nAlthough established in 1968, an official series description for this series could not be found. In January 2012 an OSD was drafted based on the series description in the published soil survey and supplemented with information from the lab-sampled pedon.  The series classification when established was Coarse-loamy, mixed (calcareous), frigid Ustic Torriorthents.\nLandforms in the soil survey report were identified as \"colluvial-alluvial slopes and fans\". Examination of contour maps indicates landforms are more likely pediments below higher terraces and below bedrock-controlled uplands.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A very similar pedon at the same location as the series type location was sampled in 1957 for the Soil Survey Laboratory in Ft. Collins, CO; lab sample number S-57-Colo-8-4.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
