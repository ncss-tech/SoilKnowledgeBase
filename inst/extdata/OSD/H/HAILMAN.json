  "OVERVIEW": "The Hailman series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from intermediate igneous rocks.  Hailman soils are on ground and lateral moraines and have slopes of 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
