  "OVERVIEW": "The Hailman series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from intermediate igneous rocks.  Hailman soils are on ground and lateral moraines and have slopes of 3 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 58 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 25 to 40 inches thick and organic matter decreases regularly with increasing depth.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is less than 59 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are not dry for as much as 90 cumulative days in some subhorizons.  A thin layer of leaves and twigs 1 to 2 inches thick is common on the surface.  The control section averages less than 18 percent clay.  Cobble and gravel content ranges from 20 to 35 percent and may include some stone.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It ranges from cobbly light loam to cobbly loam.  This horizon has weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure.  Some thin clay films occur mainly as bridging between peds and as coatings on the sand grains."

Gardners Fork, Naz, Pargin and Sizemore soils lack a B2 horizon.  Gardners Fork soils have a shaly sandy loam control section.  Naz and Sizemore soils have less than 20 percent rock fragments.  Pargin soils have mottles at depth of about 28 inches.  Shook soils have coarse sandy loam and sandy loam control sections."
