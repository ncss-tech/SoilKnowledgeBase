Mean annual precipitation typically ranges from 10 to 14 inches with a summer maximum. In some areas the series has ranged to 16 inches of precipitation. In Utah the annual precipitation ranges as low as 8 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 190 days and elevation ranges from 4,700 to 7,800 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification change from fine-loamy family to coarse loamy family is based on four sets of NSSL data as follows: S82AZ-015-034 (82P0878), S83NM-019-002 and 003 (83P0851 and 83P0852), and S91NM-057-005 (92P0337). Total clay averages greater than 18 percent but silicate clay averages less than 18 percent.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 7 inches. (A horizon). When this horizon meets the color requirements of a mollic epipedon, it fails to meet the thickness requirements.\nCalcic horizons: 11 to 37 inches. (Bk1, Bk2 horizons).\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
