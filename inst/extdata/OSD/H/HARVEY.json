  "OVERVIEW": "The Harvey series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium and windblown sediments derived dominantly from sandstone, shale, and limestone. Harvey soils are on hills, swales, plateaus, bajadas, mesas, and fan piedmonts .  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification change from fine-loamy family to coarse loamy family is based on four sets of NSSL data as follows: S82AZ-015-034 (82P0878), S83NM-019-002 and 003 (83P0851 and 83P0852), and S91NM-057-005 (92P0337). Total clay averages greater than 18 percent but silicate clay averages less than 18 percent.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 7 inches. (A horizon). When this horizon meets the color requirements of a mollic epipedon, it fails to meet the thickness requirements.\nCalcic horizons: 11 to 37 inches. (Bk1, Bk2 horizons).\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
