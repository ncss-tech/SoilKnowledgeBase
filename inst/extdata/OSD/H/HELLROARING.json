  "OVERVIEW": "The Hellroaring series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits. These sodium affected soils occur on lakebeds.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
