  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Hickoryknob soils were previously mapped as Cowee soils. These soils are currently classified with mixed mineralogy, but have a grain count of more than 45 percent mica minerals in the mineralogy control section. It is anticipated once the 2008 taxonomy proposals are approved, Hickoryknob soils will be officially reclassified with micaceous mineralogy. A revision in the OSD will be issued once the change is incorporated in the next version of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 1 to 4 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 4 to 23 inches (Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact--contact at 23 inches (Cr layer)\nLithic contact--contact at 36 inches (R layer)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 33 inches"
