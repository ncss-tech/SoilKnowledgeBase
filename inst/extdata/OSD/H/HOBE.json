    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 65 inches.  Total thickness of the A, E, and Bh horizons is less than 80 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the B horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 6 to 8.  Streaks in shades of brown or gray along old root range from none to common.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma 1 to 4.  In less than 40 percent of each pedon, the Bh horizon is firm and weakly to strongly cemented.  Pockets of E horizon material occur in this horizon in some pedons.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe BE part of the BE/Bh horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Bh part has the same color range as the Bh horizon.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic accumulations in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to common.  This horizon is discontinuous or dips below 80 inches in some pedons but is present in 60 percent or more of each pedon.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam with pockets or lenses of loamy fine sand."

In addition, Ankona soils are in the ortstein family, Immokalee soils do not have argillic horizons below the spodic horizon, and Waveland soils are in the ortstein family and do not have argillic horizons below the spodic horizon.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Jonathan and Pomello soils are on lower positions and do not have argillic horizons below the spodic horizons.  In addition, Jonathan have spodic horizons below a depth of 50 inches and is in the ortstein family.  The poorly drained Salerno soils are on lower positions and do not have an argillic horizon below the spodic horizon.  Satellite and St. Lucie soils are sandy throughout.  In addition, Satellite soils are on lower positions and somewhat poorly drained while St. Lucie soils are on higher positions and are excessively drained."
