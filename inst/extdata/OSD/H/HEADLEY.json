    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F. The soils have a udic moisture regime but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more. The solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches thick. The 10- to 40-inch control section is silt loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  Below the depth of 40 inches, rock fragments range to 50 percent in some pedons on steep slopes. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.  The soils have an ochric epipedon or have an umbric epipedon less than 10 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and a field estimated clay content of 10 to 18 percent.  It is estimated to have acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and less than 2.0 cmol per kg fine earth of 1N KCL extractable aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry. It has weak or moderate very fine or fine subangular blocky structure.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and a field estimated clay content of 10 to 18 percent.\nThe 2C horizon, or C horizon when present in some pedons, have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles with a field estimated clay content of 10 to 15 percent.  They are friable or firm."

The soils formed in medium textured loess derived mainly from glacially ground andesitic and basaltic rocks and mixed with some ash. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 125 inches. The mean annual temperature 45 to 50 degrees F. The mean January temperature is 34 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 64 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 170 days."
