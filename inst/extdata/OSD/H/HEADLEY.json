  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Headley series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in medium textured loess derived primarily from andesitic and basaltic rocks with some volcanic ash. Headley soils are on hillsides in glaciated valleys in mountainous areas and have slopes of 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F. The soils have a udic moisture regime but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more. The solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches thick. The 10- to 40-inch control section is silt loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  Below the depth of 40 inches, rock fragments range to 50 percent in some pedons on steep slopes. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.  The soils have an ochric epipedon or have an umbric epipedon less than 10 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and a field estimated clay content of 10 to 18 percent.  It is estimated to have acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and less than 2.0 cmol per kg fine earth of 1N KCL extractable aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry. It has weak or moderate very fine or fine subangular blocky structure.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and a field estimated clay content of 10 to 18 percent.\nThe 2C horizon, or C horizon when present in some pedons, have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles with a field estimated clay content of 10 to 15 percent.  They are friable or firm."
