These soils formed in colluvium and old alluvium derived dominantly from quartzite, gneiss, or mica schist, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 1,600 to 3,900 feet.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches.  The frost-free period is from 50 to 110 days."
