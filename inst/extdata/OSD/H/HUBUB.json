  "OVERVIEW": "The Hubub series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terraces and benches.  They formed in colluvium and old alluvium derived dominantly from quartzite, gneiss or mica schist, with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 38 inches and average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
