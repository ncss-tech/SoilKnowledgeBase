  "OVERVIEW": "The Havrelon series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains of major streams and tributaries and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch-control section typically is stratified with loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam materials averaging between 18 and 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  Thin strata of sandy loam, very fine sandy loam clay, or silty clay are common; and thin strata of sand and fine gravel are in some pedons.  Some strata have faint to distinct redoximorphic features.  Organic matter varies widely and decreases irregularly with depth.  Some pedons have thin Ab horizons.  The soil is slightly alkaline throughout.  Saline and flooded phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Surface horizons having values as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist do not exceed 4 inches in thickness.  The A horizon commonly is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or very fine sandy loam and less commonly fine sandy loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is stratified very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam.  It is silty clay or clay in the lower part of some pedons."

Microrelief is in areas where floodwaters have filled and cut at different rates.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F and mean annual precipitation from 13 to 16 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Banks, Korchea, Lallie, Lohler, Straw and Trembles soils.  Banks soils are on levees adjacent to the streams and on floodwater deposits.  They are sandy.  Korchea soils are on low terraces adjacent to the Havrelon soils.  They have dark-colored surface horizons 7 to 10 inches thick.  Lallie soils are in low oxbows and abandoned channels.  They are very poorly drained.  Lohler soils are on slightly lower positions and typically at a greater distance away from the main stream channel than the Havrelon soils.  They are fine.  Trembles soils typically are at a greater distance away from the main stream channel than the Havrelon soils and typically are on slightly higher positions.  They are coarse-loamy.  Straw soils are on low terraces.  They have mollic epipedons."
