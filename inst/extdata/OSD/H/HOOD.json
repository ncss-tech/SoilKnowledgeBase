  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hood soils are on dissected terraces and terrace escarpments. Elevation is 100 to 1,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. These soils formed in very deep silty or loamy lacustrine deposits. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches. The mean annual temperature is typically 49 to 51 degrees F. but ranges to 46 degrees F. in Washington.  The mean January temperature is about 33 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F. The frost-free (32 degrees F.) season is 115 to 180 days."
