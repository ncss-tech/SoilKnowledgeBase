  "OVERVIEW": "The Hillto series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium and glacial outwash derived dominantly from sandstone, limestone, shale, and quartzite.  These soils occur on outwash fans and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C. (41 deg. F.) and the average annual precipitation is about 330 mm (13 in.).",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to a carbonate cemented hardpan ranges from 50 to 100 cm (20-40 in.).  Rock fragments in the control section are gravel and gravel size hardpan fragments and average 35 to 60 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 5 to 8 deg. C (42-47 deg. F.), and the mean summer soil temperature is 16 to 19 deg. C (61-65 deg. F).  These soils are dry in all parts 40 percent of the time or more cumulative when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is above 5 degrees C. (41 deg. F).  The soil moisture regime is Ustic, bordering on Aridic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist.  It is sandy loam or loam and ranges from 0 to 5 percent gravel.  The A horizon is non-effervescent or slightly effervescent and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  It is sandy loam or loam and contains less than 15 percent gravel and gravel size hardpan fragments.  The Bw horizon is non-effervescent to slightly effervescent, and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  It is dominantly very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loam.  The upper part of the Bk horizon has gravelly loam in some pedons.  The Bk horizon is strongly or very strongly effervescent, and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
