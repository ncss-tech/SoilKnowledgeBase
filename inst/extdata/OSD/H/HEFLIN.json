  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 49 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 64 degrees F.  The moisture regime is ustic (typic ustic subclass). Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 30 inches.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material is more than 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above 40 inches and are mainly 2mm to 3 inches in diameter.  The solum ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is loam or clay loam and has 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is typically loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 27 to 35 percent clay.  In some pedons a lithic or paralithic contact is at depths of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes typically range from about 4 to 26 percent.  The soils formed in thick, noncalcareous, medium to moderately fine textured materials weathered principally from sandstone and shale.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is 20 to 25 inches; mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 60 degrees F.  Elevation is about 7,100 feet."
