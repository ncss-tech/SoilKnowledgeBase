The type location was moved to Walla Walla County. This is the last survey area where the Helmer series is in use. The series concept has been modified to match the concept used in the Walla Walla County soil survey. The original concept of Helmer included a fragipan at 14 to 20 inches from the soil surface.  Further investigation is needed to characterize the series in MLRA 43C.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
