  "OVERVIEW": "The Huevi series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed gravelly alluvium. The Huevi series are on fan remnants, ballenas and fan terraces. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",

The elevations are 480 to 3,000 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert.. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches; the mean annual air temperature is 70 to 78 degrees F., and the frost free season is 240 to 365 days."
