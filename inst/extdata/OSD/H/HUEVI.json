    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Huevi soils are on fan remnants, ballenas and fan terraces. These soils formed in mixed gravelly alluvium. Slope ranges from 1 to 70 percent. The elevations are 480 to 3,000 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert.. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches; the mean annual air temperature is 70 to 78 degrees F., and the frost free season is 240 to 365 days."
