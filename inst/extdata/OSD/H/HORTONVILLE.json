  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Hortonville soils were formerly included with the Kewaunee series.\nA new series is needed for 1,755 acres correlated  as Hortonville, limestone substratum in Outagamie County (limestone at 40 to 60 inches).\nIn Winnebago County, there are 28,568 acres correlated as a Taxadjunt to the Hortonville series because they do not have a glossic horizon.  It appears they classify as fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Hapludalfs.  They do not fit any existing series.  A new series is needed.\n10/04  The difference in concept between Hortonville and Waymor is unclear. It appears that, at the time of mapping, the concept was that Hortonville had more clay than Waymor in the lower subsoil and in the substratum. However, numerous field descriptions and limited lab data do not show a significant mutually exclusive difference. This revision differentiates the two soils based on the weighted average clay content in the particle-size control section (18-27% for Waymor and 27-35% for Hortonville). The limited lab data available supports this. However, field descriptions do not entirely support this separation. For example, the typical pedon for Waymor in Kewaunee County has textures of silty clay loam and clay loam in the argillic horizon. If the textures are correct, this pedon would average more than 27 percent clay in the argillic. Additional study of these two soils is needed to determine if they can be separated and on what criteria.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); glossic horizon - 23 to 31 cm (9 to 12 inches) (B/E); argillic horizon - 23 to 71 cm (9 to 28 inches) (B/E, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3); haplic feature - glossic horizon less than 51 cm (20 inches) thick.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to soil survey sample number S78WI-135-003 for NSSL data on the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
