  "OVERVIEW": "The Honlu series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Honlu soils are on fan remnants and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
