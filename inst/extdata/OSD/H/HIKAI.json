  "OVERVIEW": "The Hikai series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum from limestone, and dolomite. Hikai soils are on shoulders and summits of structural benches on plateaus. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
