Biscaro soils have weak continuous silica cementation at a depth of 14 to 19 inches and are 20 to 40 inches deep to soft tuff which extend to a depth of 60 inches or more.  The Bowns soils are moderately deep to hard bedrock.  The Mahala and Verdico are 20 to 40 inches deep to soft tuff which extends to a depth of 60 inches or more.  These soils are Berbugo, Gariper, Locey, Lodico, Poall and Spanhenburg ?????"

Elevation is 5,300 to 5,600 feet.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 14 inches, including 10 to 20 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F, mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F, and mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F. Frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
