Abgese, Ackley, Hardtrigger, Morfitt, Shawave, soils have secondary carbonates (Bk) immediately below the argillic.   Bluelight, Colbar, and Nosser soils are moderately deep to lithic contact.  Greenbrae soils are formed in alluvium from granite, and have more than 40 percent sand which is dominantly medium sand or coarser.  Morfitt and Turria soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Stiles soils have moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline argillic horizons.  Barasco soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 57 degrees F., and have multiple strongly contrasting textural discontinuities.  Hoye soils have a solum thickness of 10 to 20 inches and have carbonates throughout the substratum."

The soil formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains.  The mean annual air temperature is about 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is 90 to 140 days."
