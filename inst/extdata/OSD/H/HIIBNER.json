    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 11 to 20 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons ranges from 45 to 60 inches or more.  The soil is slightly calcareous below depths of 45 inches in some pedons.  Rock fragments are mainly gravel and cobble size angular sandstone and quartzite rock fragments, but include 5 to 15 percent stones.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of about 20 inches ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F.  The soils are moist 55 to 65 percent of the time, but are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days in the 8 to 24 inch particle size control section in the summer and autumn.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It contains 3 to 6.5 percent organic matter.  This horizon has weak thin platy to fine granular or fine subangular blocky structure.  It is neutral or slightly acid and is 6 to 12 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It has moist chroma of 3 only in the upper 4 to 8 inches.  This horizon is extremely cobbly clay or extremely stony cobbly clay loam with more than 35 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent gravel, 20 to 40 percent cobbles and about 10 percent stones.  It has moderate to strong, medium to coarse prismatic structure.\nThe Bt horizon has common to continuous moderately thick or thick clay films.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline and is 36 to 50 inches or more thick."

Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from sandstone and quartzite.  The climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F, mean summer temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches and the freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days."
