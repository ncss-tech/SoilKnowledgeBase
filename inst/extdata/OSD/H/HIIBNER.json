  "OVERVIEW": "The Hiibner series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from sandstone and quartzite on fan terraces, lake terraces and mountain foot slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil is slightly calcareous below depths of 45 inches in some pedons.  Rock fragments are mainly gravel and cobble size angular sandstone and quartzite rock fragments, but include 5 to 15 percent stones.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of about 20 inches ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F.  The soils are moist 55 to 65 percent of the time, but are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days in the 8 to 24 inch particle size control section in the summer and autumn.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It contains 3 to 6.5 percent organic matter.  This horizon has weak thin platy to fine granular or fine subangular blocky structure.  It is neutral or slightly acid and is 6 to 12 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It has moist chroma of 3 only in the upper 4 to 8 inches.  This horizon is extremely cobbly clay or extremely stony cobbly clay loam with more than 35 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent gravel, 20 to 40 percent cobbles and about 10 percent stones.  It has moderate to strong, medium to coarse prismatic structure.\nThe Bt horizon has common to continuous moderately thick or thick clay films.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline and is 36 to 50 inches or more thick."
