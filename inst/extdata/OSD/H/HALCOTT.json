  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. WAB-JWW-STS",
  "REVDATE": "04/1999",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Halcott series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in till. They are nearly level to very steep soils on glaciated bedrock controlled uplands. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid throughout. Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 6 to 20 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments range from 15 to 50 percent in the A horizon and from 20 to 70 percent in the B horizon averaging more than 35 percent in the control section. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the soil.\nThe O horizon has hue of 2.5YR  to 7.5YR with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1,2, or 3. The material consists of mostly slightly to moderately decomposed leaves and twigs.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 4. Dry color value is 6 or more. It is channery or very channery loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. It has weak or moderate fine or medium granular structure. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 through 8. It is channery or very channery silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam. It has weak or moderate fine or medium subangular blocky or granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have BC or C horizons with colors and textures similar to the Bw horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. The Taconic series was in the same family but has not been classified to the 8th edition of the Keys To Soil Taxonomy. Taconic soils overlie folded phyllite bedrock.  Arnot, Catlett, Dimal, Klinesville, Nassau, Unicoi and Weikert are similar soils in related  families, but all have mesic temperature regimes. Barto and Insula soils are in  similar families, but are non-skeletal."

They formed in a thin mantle of till derived from reddish, acid sandstone, siltstone and shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 49 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 47 to 60 inches. The growing  season is 90 to 110 days."

Elka, Lewbeach, Rockrift (T), and Willowemoc soils are very deep. Onteora soils are very deep and somewhat poorly drained. Suny soils are very deep and poorly  drained. Tor soils occur on the same landscapes, but are  poorly drained. Vly soils are on the same landscapes, but are moderately deep."
