  "OVERVIEW": "The Hackney series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
