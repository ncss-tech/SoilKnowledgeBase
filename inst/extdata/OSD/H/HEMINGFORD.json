  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "CFM-DAY-CJH",
  "REVDATE": "06/2005",
  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hemingford series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in a layer of loess deposited on the underlying loamy residuum weathered from clayey siltstone and fine grained sandstone. They are on uplands. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately slow. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F at the type location.",
