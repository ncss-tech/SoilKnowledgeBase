The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The A horizons are loamy fine sand or loamy sand and range from slightly acid to medium acid.  Nodules of ironstone range from none to about 10 percent by volume.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles of red, dark red, yellowish red, or brown are few to common.  The Bt2 horizon is reticulately mottled in shades of red, yellow, brown and gray.  Reddish colors are in hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 6 or 8.  Yellowish and brownish colors have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Grayish colors have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  The lower Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Mottles are dark red, red, yellowish red, reddish yellow, strong brown, brownish yellow, or yellowish brown.  The Bt horizons are sandy clay or clay.

Conroe soils contain more than 5 percent plinthite and less than 35 percent base saturation.  Depcor and Fetzer soils have fine-loamy control sections."

At the type location, the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 69 degrees F, and Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from about 62 to 74."

A study of the type location and a number of other areas mapped as Huntsburg showed that the soil contained less than 5 percent plinthite.  It is reclassified in 1988."
