  "OVERVIEW": "The Houstenader series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from highly sheared and weathered metasedimentary rock types.  Houstenader soils occur on broad ridgetops and side slopes of hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle size control section averages less than 35 percent clay, more than 15 percent (by weight) fine sand and coarser, and 20 to 30 percent rock fragments.  Depth to high chroma redox concentrations is 11 to 20 inches.  Thickness of the solum is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches, but in some pedons may range to 45 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or less moist and dry.   It is gravelly loam with 18 to 25 percent clay.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  The soil reaction is slightly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 or less moist and dry.  It is gravelly silty clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 15 to 20 percent gravel and  5 to 10 percent cobbles.  Few fine distinct redox concentrations occur throughout this horizon.  The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or neutral, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 dry and chroma of 2 or less moist and dry.  It is very gravelly clay or very gravelly silty clay with 40 to 60 percent clay.  It has 30 to 40 percent gravel and 10 to 15 percent cobbles.
