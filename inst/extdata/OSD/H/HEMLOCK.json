    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 61 to 140 centimeters (24 to 55 inches). Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm (60 inches). Rock fragments range from 0 through 5 percent by volume in the solum and 0 to 35 percent by volume in the C horizon. The soil ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline. Carbonates are often present in this soil.\nThe Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 3. They are silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is very friable or friable. The A horizon, where present, may be less than 15.2 cm (6 inches) thick.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to the A and B horizons.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has colors similar to the B horizon. They are loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 4. It is silty clay loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or single grain. Consistence is loose to friable."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Boonewood, Hontas, Lindside, and Senecaville series are in the same family. Boonewood soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Hontas soils lack the presence of carbonates and have a dominant 2 chroma from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Lindside soils lack the presence of carbonates and are dominantly from unglaciated uplands. Senecaville soils have hues that are 7.5YR or redder throughout the solum.\nThe Eel, Lobdell, Middlebury, and Teel series are similar soils in closely related families. Eel and Lobdell soils have fine-loamy particle size control sections. Middlebury soils have coarse-loamy particle size control sections. Teel soils have coarse-silty particle size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hemlock soils are nearly level soils on floodplains. Slope ranges 0 through 3 percent. The soils formed in post glacial alluvium mainly from areas of glaciated siltstone, shale, and limestone. In some valleys, the silty alluvium overlies lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 79 through 112 centimeters (31 to 44 inches), mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.3 degrees through 9.1 degrees C (45 degrees to 48.4 degrees F), and growing season ranges from 107 through 171 days."

The Ontario soils are on nearby till mantled uplands, the Palmyra soils are on nearby outwash deposits and the Schoharie and Odessa soils are on nearby glacial lacustrine deposits."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Hemlock series was set up to cover the fine-silty moderately well drained floodplain soils not represented by any other series.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n(1.) Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (Ap horizon).\n(2.) Cambic horizon - the zone from 28 to 99 cm (11 to 39 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons).\n(3.) Fluvaquentic subgroup - an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth, > 0.2 percent carbon within a depth of 1.2 meters (4 feet), and redox features with chroma of 2 or less within 61 cm (24 inches) of the soil surface (Bw2 horizon).\n(4.) Udic soil moisture regime.\n(5.) Pedon originally described in English units, then converted to metric units.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the typical pedon is available through the NSSC lab, sample number S08NY069021.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
