Lawson soils are at lower elevations on floodplains and have a frequently saturated zone within depths of 31 to 107 cm (1 to 3.5 feet) in normal years.  Littleton soils are at slightly higher elevations on alluvial fans in large floodplains and are at lower elevations on smaller floodplains, have a cambic horizon, and have a frequently saturated zone within depths of 0.3 to 1.1 meters (1 to 3.5 feet) in normal years.  Radford soils are in landscape positions similar to those of the Huntsville soils, have mollic epipedons 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick, and have buried horizons within depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).  Sawmill soils are at lower elevations on floodplains, have a clay content of 27 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section and have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 31 cm (1 foot) in normal years."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Well drained.  A frequently saturated zone occurs within depths of 1.2 to 1.8 meters (4 to 6 feet) during April to June in normal years and is considered apparent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (1.41 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability os moderately slow or moderate.  The potential for  surface runoff is negligible to medium, depending on slope.  Flooding frequency is rare to frequent for very brief or brief periods during the months of February to November from precipitation events and snowmelt."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Huntsville soils on the wider flood plains are cultivated. The principal crops are corn and soybeans. Many areas on narrow flood plains are pastured or wooded. The native vegetation is big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie."
