  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 2 to 10 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.  Weighted average of rock fragments ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Rock fragments are primarily channers and flagstones. The fine-earth fraction is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.\nBedrock is slightly weathered schist, phyllite, or slate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hubbardton soils are on gently sloping to very steep glaciated uplands.  They are on mountain side slopes, mountain tops, mountain ridges, hilltops, and hill slopes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent.  They formed in loamy till of Wisconsin age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 35 to 50 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 300 to 2000 feet above mean sea level."
