    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Axford, Babbington, Benwy, Bidwell, Brogan (T), Caliralls, Drybed, Polly and Zen series. Axford soils are deep to weathered bedrock and have average annual soil temperatures of 54 to 58 degrees F. Babbington soils are moderately well drained and are calcareous in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Benwy soils have a duripan at depths greater than 40 inches and average more than 5 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Bidwell soils have secondary calcium carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Brogan soil shave a solum 20 to 40 inches thick over stratified loam and very fine sandy loam and are 15 to 25 inches to carbonates. Caliralls soils are more than 38 inches to the base of the argillic horizon and lack a substratum with coarse sand from lacustrine materials. Drybed soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to secondary calcium carbonates. Zen soils are moderately deep. Polly soils are 15 to 25 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon and secondary calcium carbonates and are less than 5 inches to the top of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Haw soils are level to steep on dissected terraces, foothills, alluvial fans, fan remnants and draw bottoms at elevations of 2,000 to 5,300 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent. These soils formed in coarse or moderately coarse textured, old unconsolidated or weakly consolidated lacustrine sediments derived mainly from intrusive igneous rocks and are commonly high in quartz, and in micaceous and feldspathic materials. A thin mantle of loessial material covers most of the sediments. The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer. Average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 15 inches. Average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F. Frost-free period is 90 to 160 days."

Lolalita soils are moderately coarse textured and lack a mollic epipedon and argillic horizon. Montour soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Van Dusen soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches and are on toeslopes. Dishner soils are on ridges. Lolalita, Montour and Van Dusen soils are on similar landscape positions."

Crops grown include small grains, corn, potatoes and sugar beets. The dominant natural vegetation is bluebunch wheatgrass, Sandberg bluegrass, Wyoming big sagebrush, Thurber needlegrass, and Indian ricegrass."
