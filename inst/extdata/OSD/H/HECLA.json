  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Mollic colors extend to depths of more than 18 inches, however horizons with mollic colors below depths of 20 inches and extending to depths of 40 inches contain less than .6 percent organic carbon.  Typically, a few faint or distinct redoximorphic features are below the lower part of the A horizon or the AC horizon and distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are in the lower part of the C horizon.  Buried horizons are below depths of 30 inches in most pedons.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 80 inches or more. The particle-size control section averages more than 45 percent fine sand and very fine sand, less than 35 percent medium and coarser sand, and less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the upper part and loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand in the lower part.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe AC horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  The C horizon is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sand.  It ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Clay loam or loam till is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  Very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, silty clay loam, silty clay or silt loam material is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hecla soils are on plane and convex surfaces of sandy lacustrine and glacial outwash plains and nearby sand-mantled till plains.  Slope gradients typically are less than 3 percent and range from 0 to 6 percent.  Hecla soils formed in reworked sands.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 34 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 14 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 110 to 140 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

Garborg and Ulen and soils are somewhat poorly drained. Garborg soils are in shallow depressions and Ulen soils are on flats.  In addition, the Ulen soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches. Fossum, Hamar, and Venlo soils are in the lower, wetter positions. Maddock soils do not have redoximorphic features within depths of 40 inches and typically are on slightly steeper slopes at higher elevations."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 20 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).  The AC horizon has the color, but not the organic carbon content to be mollic.\nThe zone immediately below the mollic epipedon (AC horizon) meets the color requirement for the aquic subgroup, but does not have aquic conditions.\nThe pedon meets the color requirement for the aquic subgroup in the horizon immediately below the mollic epipedon (AC horizon), however the soil does not have aquic conditions immediately below the mollic epipedon and does not meet the subgroup criteria.  Saturation does not occur shallower than 2.5 feet.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data for the typical pedon of Hecla loamy fine sand is No. 74L1051-74L1059.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
