  "OVERVIEW": "The Hano series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on hillslopes.  These soils formed in thin eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived dominantly from shale and sandstone.  Slope ranges from 2 to 10 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 1l inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
