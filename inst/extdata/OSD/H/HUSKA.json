  "OVERVIEW": "The Huska series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum from interbedded shale and sandstone of Permian age.  These soils are on crests and upper side slopes of low hills in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA80A).  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 840 mm (33 in).",
