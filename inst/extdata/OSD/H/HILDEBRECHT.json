  "OVERVIEW": "The Hildebrecht series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils on ridgetops and side slopes. They formed in loess over residuum weathered from dolomite. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow in the fragipan. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C. (56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches).",
