Apalona soils have a Bt/E horizon above the fragipan. Ava soils have less than 4 percent rock fragments in the fragipan. Bedford soils have a paleosol (3Btb) horizon below the fragipan. Boston soils are typically 50 to 70 inches to a lithic contact and are calcareous below the fragipan. Cincinnati soils have carbonates from 122 to 325 centimeters (48 to 128 inches) and contain glacial pebbles below the fragipan. Fountainville soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Grantsburg soils do not have rock fragemtns. Hosmer soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the fragipan and below and formed in loess more than 1.2 meters (4 feet) thick. Lawrenceville soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments in the solum. Nicholson, Omulga, Otwell, Otwood, Solsberry, and Weisburg soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the fragipan.
