  "OVERVIEW": "The Hooly series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and loess over diatomaceous sediments. Hooly soils are on old lake basins and valley floors and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The depth to the diatomaceous sediments (2C horizon) ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  The solum is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Redox features with chroma of 2 are within 10 to 20 inches of the surface. The 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction makes up 50 to 80 percent of the less than 2.0 mm fine-earth fraction throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist. It has a moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter and 15-bar moisture of 15 to 25 percent based on an air-dried sample.  It is estimated to have a phosphate retention of more than 25 percent, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 0.4 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  It is silt loam or silt. It has a moist bulk density of 0.45 to 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter and 15-bar moisture of 5 to 10 percent based on an air-dried sample."
