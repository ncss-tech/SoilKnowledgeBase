  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The depth to the diatomaceous sediments (2C horizon) ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  The solum is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Redox features with chroma of 2 are within 10 to 20 inches of the surface. The 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction makes up 50 to 80 percent of the less than 2.0 mm fine-earth fraction throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist. It has a moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter and 15-bar moisture of 15 to 25 percent based on an air-dried sample.  It is estimated to have a phosphate retention of more than 25 percent, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 0.4 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  It is silt loam or silt. It has a moist bulk density of 0.45 to 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter and 15-bar moisture of 5 to 10 percent based on an air-dried sample."

These soils formed in volcanic ash and loess over mixed volcanic ash and diatomaceous sediments. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.   The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 20 inches.  The frost free period is 110 to 150 days."
