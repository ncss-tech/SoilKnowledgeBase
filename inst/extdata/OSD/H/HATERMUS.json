    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 36 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F.  Depth to very strongly alkaline shale is 10 to 20 inches.  The soils are calcareous throughout.  The ca horizons have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The control section has more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  It commonly is loam averaging between 18 and 27 percent clay.  Some pedons are very fine sandy loam or clay loam.   It is strongly alkaline in the upper part and very strongly alkaline in the lower part.  Coarse shale fragments less than one-half inch in size are 5 percent or less.  The A and C horizons have hue of 5Y through 10YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist."

Horsely soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium and shale at depths of less than 10 inches.  Huguston soils have less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium and less than 18 percent clay in the control section."

They formed in residuum weathered from very strongly alkaline shale.  Mean annual temperature is 34 to 45 degrees F.  Precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  Elevation is 6,000 to 7,000 feet.  The growing season is 80 to 110 days, but frost may occur in any month."
