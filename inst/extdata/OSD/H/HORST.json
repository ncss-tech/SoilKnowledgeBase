    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is  64 to 66 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. the entire year.  The 6 to 18 inch section is dry in all parts from May 15 to October 31 and moist in all parts from November 15 to May 1.  Clay content for the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent; fine sand and coarser sand ranges from 6 to 12 percent. Organic carbon content is 1 to 3 percent in the upper 35 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 or more inches thick.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, or 4/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/2; or 7.5YR 3/2.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 4/3; 7.5YR 6/4 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3; 7.5YR 4/4 or 3/4.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons lack a BC horizon. Some pedons have a sandy loam and loamy sand overwash. Some pedons do not have a Bt horizon, or have clay percentages that remain constant or decrease with depth."
