In addition, Goldpeak soils are cool thermic with a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 18 degrees C and Wingap soils have a paralithic contact between 100 and 150 centimeters from the soil surface. Friedliver soils have an argillic horizon with an upper boundary between 25 and 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) from the soil surface. Goldivide soils have an argillic horizon with an upper boundary between 50 and 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) from the soil surface and an upper depth to visible secondary carbonates of 25 to 75 centimeters (10 to 30 inches). Hexie and Littlefargo soils have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) from the soil surface. In addition, Littlefargo soils are noneffervescent throughout the profile and have a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 19 degrees C. Jumborox soils are cool thermic with a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 19 degrees C. Searchlight soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, visible secondary silica on rock fragments beginning 5 centimeters below the mineral soil surface and 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent throughout the profile. Sonoita soils have a medium acid to neutral A horizon and are intermittently moist for more than 20 days cumulative during the summer. Tray soils have a massive, strongly to very strongly alkaline argillic horizon with an ESP of 15 to 30 and are calcareous throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Helendale soils are on fan piedmonts, fan remnants, alluvial fans and terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Elevations are 610 to 1,200 meters (2,000 to 3,935 feet). These soils formed in alluvium from granitoid rock. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 200 millimeters (3 to 8 inches). The mean annual temperature is 17 to 20 degrees C (62.5 to 68 degrees F). The frost free season is 270 to 320 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 10 centimeters (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of 10 to 120 centimeters (Bt horizons).\nParticle-size control section - from a depth of 10 to 60 centimeters (Bt1,\nBt2 and part of the Bt3 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Where mapped above 1,160 meters (3,800 feet) elevation, such as Benton-Owens Valley Area Soil Survey, consider correlating those soils to the Jumborox series, a cool thermic soil. The use of Helendale in MLRA 30XA (areas without summer precipitation) such as Edwards Air Force Base, Benton-Owens Valley Area, Kern County, NE Part and the Mojave Desert, Northwest Part Soil Surveys should be reconsidered.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015.
