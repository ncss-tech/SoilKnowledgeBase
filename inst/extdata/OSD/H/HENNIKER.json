  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Henniker soils are on drumlins and glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in till of Wisconsin age derived principally from granitic and gneissic rocks.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days."

Becket and Skerry soils have a spodic horizon and generally occur on higher elevations.  The moderately well drained Metacomet soils, somewhat poorly and poorly drained Pillsbury soils, and very poorly drained Peacham soils are in a drainage sequence with Henniker soils.  Montauk and Scituate soils have a higher mean annual soil temperature and generally occur on lower elevations."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Henniker series is proposed to recognize frigid Oxyaquic Dystrudepts formed in dense, sandy till.  The concept of sandy till includes dense substrata that are sandy as well as those that are loamy and have 20 percent or more of the fabric of the till as sandy lenses or subhorizons.   The Henniker series is the Inceptisol analogue to the Becket series and the frigid analogue to the Montauk series.  This pedon was classified to the ninth edition of Keys to Taxonomy, 2003.  Series concept was compiled from data collected as part of the soil surveys of Belknap and Merrimack Counties, NH and Franklin County, MA.  Henniker is the name of a town in southern Merrimack County, NH.\nFeatures and diagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Oi, Oe and Ap horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 29 inches (Bw1, Bw2 and BC horizons).\n3. Oxyaquic feature - perching effect of the Cd layers.\n4. Densic contact - at 29 inches.\n5. Densic materials - The zone from 29 to 65 inches (Cd1, Cd2 and Cd3 horizons).\n6. Insufficient data to determine mineralogy class.  Mixed mineralogy is assumed.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for this pedon, NSSL, SMA-95-011-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
