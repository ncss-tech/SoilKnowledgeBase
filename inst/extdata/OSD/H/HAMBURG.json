  "STATES": "IL,IA,KS,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hamburg series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on moderately steep to very steep convex shoulders, backslopes, or ridges on uplands. These soils formed in calcareous loess. Slopes range from 20 to 90 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).",
