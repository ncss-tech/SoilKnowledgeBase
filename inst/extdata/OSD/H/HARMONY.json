  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 30 inches and extends into the Bt horizon.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 16 to 38 inches.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and a chroma of 1.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Clean silt and sand grains coat surfaces of peds in some pedons.  It typically is silty clay loam but is silty clay in some pedons averaging 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a BA horizon.\nThe Bt2 and Bt3 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are silty clay loam or silty clay averaging 35 to 50 percent clay.  They are from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Clean silt and sand grains coat surfaces of peds in the upper inch of the Bt horizon in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam or loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam and typically is varved with very thin strata of very fine sand to clay. Varves range from less than 1 mm to 10 mm thick.  Few to many fine nests and striations of salt and gypsum are in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Loamy glacial till is below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burnel, Gwinner, Hetland, LaPlatta and Sieche series in the same family.  The Burnel soils typically have a thinner A horizon and formed in alluvium.  The lower part of the Gwinner soils formed in glacial till having 2 to 10 percent coarse fragments. The Hetland soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the surface horizon. The LaPlatta soils have drier summers, contain ash and vermiculite, and formed in residuum weathered from tuff, conglomerate, tuffaceous sandstone, and limestone.  Sieche soils contain more sand and formed in glacial till having 2 to 10 percent coarse fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harmony soils are on level and nearly level lake plains.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous lacustrine deposits of stratified silt, fine sand, and clay. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 24 inches."

The Aberdeen, Exline and Nahon soils are on the broad smooth flats in close association with the Harmony soils.  They have natric horizons.  In addition, the Exline soils have salt accumulation within 16 inches of the surface.  The Beotia soils are on slightly higher plane to concave surfaces, and the Great Bend and Zell soils are on the slightly higher convex surfaces than the Harmony soils.  The Beotia and Great Bend soils do not have argillic horizons and are fine-silty.  The Zell soils are coarse-silty."
