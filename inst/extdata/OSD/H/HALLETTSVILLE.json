  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to greater than 80 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches thick and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon in some pedons.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to about 50 inches.  Slickensides and pressure faces range from few to common in the control section.  The COLE ranges from 0.07 to 0.10.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 5 to 12 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 6.  Values of 3 or 4 are limited to the upper 12 inches and chroma of 6 is limited to the lower part.  Texture is sandy clay, clay loam, or clay.  The average clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent.  Mottles in shades of yellow, red or brown range from few to common and some layers have a mottled matrix.  Reaction is medium to mildly alkaline.\nThe Btk or Btkss horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6, with or without reddish, brownish, or grayish redoximorphic features.  Texture is sandy clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Concretions, threads, or masses of calcium carbonate range from few to common.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and the matrix is calcareous in some pedons.\nThe C, 2BC, BCK,or 2C horizons, where present, are in shades of brown, yellow, gray, or white.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have brown, yellow, or red masses of iron accumulation.  Most pedons contain a few masses of barite.  Siliceous pebbles range from none to a few.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Barbarosa (TX)series.  Similar soils are the Agra, Coy, Crockett, Elmendorf, Kirkland, Renfrow, and Sproul series.  Barbarosa soils have a more clayey A horizon, more alkaline reaction and formed in alluvium.  Agra, Kirkland, and Renfrow soils have mixed mineralogy.  Coy and Elmendorf soils are in the hyperthermic temperature regime and Coy soils are calcareous throughout and along with Elmendorf do not have redoximorphic features in the argillic horizons.  Crockett soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Sproul soils have very-fine control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hallettsville soils are on gently sloping uplands.  They formed in alkaline clayey sediments of the Goliad and Fleming geological formations of Tertiary age.  Slopes are smooth to slightly concave.  Slope gradients are dominantly 1 to 3 percent but range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 68 to 70 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 260 to 280 days and elevation ranges from 250 to 600 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indicies range from 48 to 52."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Elmendorf series and the Cuero, Denhawken, Dubina, Engle and Frelsburg series.  Cuero and Engle soils have loamy control sections and these soils occur on higher slopes in the landscape.  Denhawken soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are in a complex with Elmendorf soils.  Dubina soils have sandy epipedons.  Denhawken, Elmendorf and Dubina soils are on similar positions to Hallettsville soils.  Frelsburg soils are calcareous and clayey throughout and are typically on slightly higher positions."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Hallettsville soils are used for rangeland, improved pasture, and cropland.  Present vegetation is a savannah with large live oak and post oak trees, with bluestems, gramas, paspalums and panicum grasses and invading yaupon.  Pasture grasses are mainly improved species of bermudagrass, bluestems and Kleingrass.  A few areas are in cultivation, mainly to corn and grain sorghums."
