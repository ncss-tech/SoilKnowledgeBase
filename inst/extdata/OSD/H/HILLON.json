  "OVERVIEW": "The Hillon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loam till.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Hillon soils are on till plains, hills, and escarpments.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
