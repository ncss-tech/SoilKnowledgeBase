    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Herlong soils are on lake terraces.  These soils formed in loess over alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  The tufa layer is thought to have formed on a surface that was immediately offshore of ancestral Pleistocene Lake Lahontan.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 1,219 to 1,234 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 152 to 203 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9.5 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
