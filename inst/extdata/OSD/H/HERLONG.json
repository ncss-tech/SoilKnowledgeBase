  "OVERVIEW": "The Herlong series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Herlong soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
