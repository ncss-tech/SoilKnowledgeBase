Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in horizons above the Bt3 and 0 to 35 percent in the Bt3 horizon and below.  The mean annual soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 to 3, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4, or hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4. Mottles are in shades of yellow, brown, or gray in the Bt3 horizon.  Texture of the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Texture of the fine earth in the Bt3 horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashdale, Elkhart, Elmont, Malcolm, Meadowbank, Ogle, Osco, Plano, Proctor, Toddville, and Waupecan series.  Ashdale soils typically have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and have a mean annual temperature of 45 to 53 degrees F..  Elkhart soils are calcareous at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Elmont soils typically have a paralithic contact of shale from 40 to 80 inches.  Malcolm soils have a mean annual temperature of 51 to 54 degrees F., and formed in interglacial sediments.  Meadowbank soils formed in loess and have less than 10 percent sand in the upper part of the particle size control section. Ogle, Plano, Proctor, Toddville soils formed in loess over glacial till or outwash, and have a lithologic discontinuity within 50 inches of the surface. In addition, Plano soils have a mean annual temperature of 46 to 54 degrees F., Proctor soils have a mean annual temperature of 47 to 54 degrees F., and Toddville soils have a mean annual temperature of 46 to 51 degrees F..  Osco soils have a mean annual temperature of 48 to 54 degrees F., and formed in loess with less than 7 percent sand in the particle size control section. Waupecan soils have a mean annual temperature of 45 to 54 degrees F., and have free carbonates within 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Average annual temperature is about 54 to 58 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 45 inches."

Elsah soils are loamy-skeletal, have an ochric epipedon, and are on lower flood plains.  Secesh soils are on low terraces and  have an ochric epipedon."
