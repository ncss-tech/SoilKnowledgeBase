  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry between 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent apparent clay and 5 to 30 percent rock fragments, of which 5 to 20 percent are gravel and 0 to 10 percent are cobbles.  The solum has a moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.80 grams per cubic centimeter and is dominated by amorphous material. It has a phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, and 15-bar moisture of 15 to 25 percent based on an air-dried sample.  The umbric epipedon and solum thickness is 20 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe B horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam, or gravelly clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y and value of 4 or 5 moist and 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  Most rock fragments are highly weathered.  It has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hobit series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes.  These soils formed in colluvium derived dominantly from andesite and volcanic tuffs and breccias. Slopes are 12 to 60 percent. Elevation is 5,000 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool dry summers.The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is less than 100 days."
