  "OVERVIEW": "The Hickman series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from valley fill materials on flood plains and valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches; mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
