    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harleston soils are on terraces and uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain and the Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods.

The somewhat poorly drained Basin and Escambia soils are on slightly lower positions. In additions, Basin soils have a fragipan and Escambia soils have more than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the subsoil. The well drained Benndale and McLaurin soils are on slightly higher positions. In addition, McLaurin soils have redder subsoils. The Somewhat excessively drained Eustis soils are on higher positions and are sandy throughout. The moderately well and well drained Poarch soils are in similar positions but have more than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the subsoil. Saucier soils are on similar positions, have fine-loamy control sections and have more than 5 percent, by volume, plinthite in the subsoil. The poorly drained Smithton soils are on adjacent lower flood plains and depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Susquehanna soils are on adjacent lower side slopes and have clayey smectitic subsoils."
