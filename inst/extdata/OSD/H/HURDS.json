Chilicotal soils are calcareous, have ustic aridic moisture regime, light colored surface layers, do not have argillic horizons and occur on lower piedmont slopes.  Friends soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Limpia and Medley soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Liv soils occur on adjacent slopes, have thicker mollic epipedons, and are moderately deep over igneous bedrock.  Mainstay soils are less than 20 inches to igneous bedrock.  Mitre soils are shallow to indurated caliche."
