  "REVDATE": "03/2017",
  "STATES": "CO,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hanksville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum, colluvium, and slope alluvium derived from shale.  Hanksville soils are on hillslopes, eroding shale hills, lower terraces, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches (178mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F (10C).",
