  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.  Thickness of solum is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to free carbonates is 40 to 60 inches or more.  These soils typically have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments throughout the pedon.  Content of rock fragments are higher in thin stone lines.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology and are pebble and cobble in size.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The E horizon is loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.   The reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Some pedons have sandy EB, E/B, B/E or BE horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand or loamy sand and their gravelly or cobbly analogues.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, but includes subhorizons of loam, or sandy clay loam.  The particle size control section typically averages 6 to 14 percent clay, but ranges from 6 to 18 percent and 65 to 75 percent sand.  It is strongly acid to neutral.  Some pedons have 2BC horizons.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is sandy loam or loamy sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have pockets or wedges of sandy or gravelly material in the 2Bt and 2Cd horizons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bemidji, Bushville, Eckvoll, and Watab soils in the same family and the closely related Meehan, Paddock, and Sandwick soils.  Bemidji soils do not have dense till substrata and are more permeable in the substrata.  Bushville and Watab soils have hues redder than 10YR in the 2Bt horizons.  Eckvoll soils have finer-textured argillic horizons and do not have dense till substrata.  Meehan soils are formed in outwash sediments and do not have the underlying Cd horizons of loamy glacial till.  Paddock soils do not have thick sandy layers in the upper part and are more poorly drained.  Sandwick soils have more clay in the lower part of the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Huntersville soils are nearly level to gently sloping and are on slightly convex to concave positions on drumlins and moraines.  They are formed in a sandy outwash and underlying dense sandy loam glacial till.  Slopes ranges from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 170.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1600 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Meehan soils are on similar positions and are sandy throughtoute.  The excessively drained Menahga soils are on similar positions and are sandy throughout.  The poorly drained Staples and the poorly or very poorly drained Roscommon soils are in the depressions and interdrumlin areas.  Well drained Redeye soils are upslope and adjacent to areas of Huntersville soils.  Organic soils in depressions and interdrumlins are also associated in many places."

Permeability is rapid in the sandy upper part and slow or very slow in the dense underlying till.  Depth to a perched seasonal water table ranges from 2.5 to 3.5 feet during November to July in most years."
