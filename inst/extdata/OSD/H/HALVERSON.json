  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 16 inches in thickness. Depth to the base of the argillic ranges from 26 to 55 inches. The upper sediment typically does not have rock fragments, but may contain up to 10 percent, mainly at the boundary with loamy glacial till. The loamy till contains from 2 to 13 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles of mixed lithology. The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for as long as 45 consecutive days for the 120 days following the summer solstice. It is also not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days per year in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is typically loamy fine sand or loamy sand, but includes sand and fine sand. The reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an A/E horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. The E horizons are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand. The reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is commonly loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, but the range may include sandy clay loam and sandy loam. The clay content averages between 18 and 27 percent, and sand content is 45 to 65 percent. Clean silt and sand grains occur on faces of peds or in root channels and pores in the upper part of some pedons. Clay films range from few to many, and from faint to prominent. The reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bk horizon is hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, very fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Carbonates are disseminated throughout or are in the form of common to many threads or masses. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Typically, it is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Halverson soils are on sand capped till plains and moraines of Late Wisconsin glaciation on plane to convex slopes. Slope gradients range from 0 to 25 percent. These soils formed in sandy glacial outwash or eolian sands and in underlying loamy till. Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,600 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 27 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 95 to 130 days."

The well drained Chapett soils are on similar landscapes and do not have a sandy mantle over loamy till. The moderately well drained Eckvoll soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are lower lying. The moderately well drained Foldahl soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on lower lying or less sloping terrain. The poorly and very poorly drained Kratka soils are in depressions. The well drained Maddock soils are on similar landscapes but do not have underlying loamy till within a depth of 40 inches."
