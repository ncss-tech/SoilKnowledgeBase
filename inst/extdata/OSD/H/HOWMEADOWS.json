Aquic conditions are present within 6 and 12 inches from the soil surface as indicated by redoximorphic concentrations and depletions. The particle size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay with 5 to 35 percent rock fragments. The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout. The upper portion of the profile is 10YR and the lower part is 2.5Y.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. The soil texture is silty clay loam or clay with 0 to 10 percent gravel. It has 35 to 45 percent clay. It has common to many redox concentrations.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 3 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. The soil texture is clay loam, silty clay, or clay with 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 5 to 25 percent gravel. It has 35 to 50 percent clay."

The soils formed in loess mixed with minor amounts of volcanic ash overlying clayey colluvium and residuum derived from basalt. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Tamarackcanyon, Threebuck, and Tolo soils are on adjacent north-facing side slopes. Tamarackcanyon soils are clayey-skeletal. Threebuck soils are medial over clayey-skeletal and 40 to 60 inches to bedrock. Tolo soils are ashy over loamy and greater than 60 inches to bedrock. Wilkins soils are in broad meadows and are greater than 60 inches to bedrock."
