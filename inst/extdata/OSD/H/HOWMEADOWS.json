  "OVERVIEW": "The Howmeadows series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils that formed in loess mixed with minor amounts of volcanic ash overlying clayey colluvium and residuum derived from basalt. Howmeadows soils are in narrow drainageways on plateaus and benches. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",
