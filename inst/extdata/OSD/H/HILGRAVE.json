  "OVERVIEW": "The Hilgrave series consists of deep, well drained and moderately permeable gravelly soils that formed in ancient gravelly alluvium. These soils are on moderately sloping to strongly sloping uplands. Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm (22 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
