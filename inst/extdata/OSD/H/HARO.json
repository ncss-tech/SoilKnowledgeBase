  "OVERVIEW": "The Haro series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in glacial drift mixed with colluvium from metasedimentary bedrock. Haro soils are on south facing hillslopes and mountain slopes at elevations near sea level to 2200 feet. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Dobson soils are moist less than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature is greater than 47 degrees F (aridic soil moisture regime). McMullin soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in the Bw horizon and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Reston soils are 5 to 10 inches deep to a lithic contact. Whisk soils have granitic rock fragments."

Cady soils have an ochric epipedon and generally occur under a denser forest canopy on northerly slopes. Doebay soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches, an ochric epipedon, and generally occur under a denser forest canopy on northerly slopes. Hiddenridge soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and an umbric epipedon. Turtleback soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches, an ochric epipedon, and generally occur under a denser forest canopy on northerly slopes. Pilepoint soils are on glacial outwash plains, have argillic and densic horizons, and have redoximorphic features at 20 to 40 inches. San Juan soils are on glacial outwash plains and lack a lithic contact."
