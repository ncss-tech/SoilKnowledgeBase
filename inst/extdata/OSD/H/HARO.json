  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family. Series with similar classification but mixed mineralogy include the Dobson, McMullin, Reston, and Whisk soils. Dobson soils are moist less than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature is greater than 47 degrees F (aridic soil moisture regime). McMullin soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in the Bw horizon and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Reston soils are 5 to 10 inches deep to a lithic contact. Whisk soils have granitic rock fragments."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Haro soils are on south-facing hillslopes and mountain slopes with slopes of 5 to 75 percent and elevations from 0 to 2,200 feet. These soils formed in glacial drift mixed with colluvium from metasedimentary bedrock. The maritime climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 18 to 35 inches. Average annual air temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 200 to 240 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Cady, Doebay, Hiddenridge, Turtleback (all of which also occur on hill slopes and mountain slopes), Pilepoint, and San Juan soils. Cady soils have an ochric epipedon and generally occur under a denser forest canopy on northerly slopes. Doebay soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches, an ochric epipedon, and generally occur under a denser forest canopy on northerly slopes. Hiddenridge soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and an umbric epipedon. Turtleback soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches, an ochric epipedon, and generally occur under a denser forest canopy on northerly slopes. Pilepoint soils are on glacial outwash plains, have argillic and densic horizons, and have redoximorphic features at 20 to 40 inches. San Juan soils are on glacial outwash plains and lack a lithic contact."
