  "OVERVIEW": "The Handsboro series consists of deep, very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in thick accumulations of highly decomposed herbaceous plant remains that have thin strata of mineral soil sediments.  These soils are in regularly flooded salt marshes in estuaries of the Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods and Atlantic Coast Flatwoods Major Land Resource Areas.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sulfur content ranges from 0.75 to about 4.5 percent in the subhorizons within 12 to 40 inches of the surface.  The organic layers in all tiers are dominantly sapric materials, but some pedons have layers of hemic materials.  Thin mineral strata are within a depth of 12 to 51 inches.  Thickness of the individual mineral layers commonly ranges from 2 to 6 inches, and the combined thickness is less than 16 inches within 32 inches of the surface.  Below 37 inches, thickness and arrangement of the strata are variable.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in water throughout the soil in the natural state; after air drying the pH value in .01M calcium chloride is less than 3.5.  Conductivity of the saturation extract of layers at depths below about 6 inches ranges from about 16 to 35 mmho/cm.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is mucky loam, mucky silt loam, or mucky silty clay loam.  The hemic or sapric materials within all tiers have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma or 1 or 2.  The rubbed fiber content ranges from 1 to 16 percent, and the mineral content ranges from 30 to 40 percent.  The mineral strata of the C horizon have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The mineral strata in the 12 to 37 inch depth are loam or silt loam.  Below 37 inches, the mineral strata are loam, sandy loam, silty clay, or clay."

Closely related series include the Allemands, Belhaven, Capers, Dare, Dorovan, Kenner, Lafitte, Mattamuskett, Maurepas, Okeechobee, Pamlico, Pawcatuck, Ponzer, Pungo, Tomoko, and Westbrook series.  Pocaty series do not have strata of mineral material within the control section.  Allemands, Belhaven, Mattamuskett, Ponzer, and Tomoko soils have thick layers of mineral materials above 51 inches.  Also, Tomoko soils have a hyperthermic temperature class; Belhaven, Dare, Dorovan, Mattamuskett, Pamlico, Ponzer, and Pungo soils are extremely acid to strongly acid in undrained pedons in all parts of the control section.  Capers soils do not have organic material in more than half of the upper 32 inches.  Lafitte, Maurepas, Okeechobee, and all the other competing series except Capers do not have sulfidic materials within 40 inches of the surface.  Pawcatuck and Westbrook soils have a mesic temperature class, have fibric material, and are underlain by mineral layers at a depth of less than 51 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Handsboro soils are in large tidal marsh areas of the Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods and Atlantic Coast Flatwood Major Land Resource Areas.  Elevations are approximately sea level or below.  The soil formed in herbaceous plant remains and stratified loamy alluvium deposited in areas that are subject to daily or frequent inundation with brackish water.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 58 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees Fahrenheit."
