  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hugus soils are on mountain slopes, ridges, foothills and dissected terraces. Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium, residuum and/or tertiary alluvium derived dominantly from metasedimentary rock or gneiss with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Elevation ranges from 1,600 to 5,130 feet(488 to 1565 meters). The average annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is 30 to 55 inches (762 to 1397 mm). The average frost-free period is 50 to 120 days."

Lotuspoint and Pinecreek soils are on south-facing mountain slopes and do not have argillic horizons. Kruse soils are on east and west-facing foothills and are fine-loamy. Tigley soils are on south-facing foothills and have low volcanic ash content."
