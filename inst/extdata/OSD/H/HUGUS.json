  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hugus series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes, ridges, foothills and dissected terraces. They formed in colluvium derived from metasedimentary rock, residuum and/or tertiary alluvium derived from quartzite or gneiss rock with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 5 to 75 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 35 inches.",
