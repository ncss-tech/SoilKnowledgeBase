  "OVERVIEW": "The Harbor series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on low beach ridges, offshore bars and deltas on Wisconsinan age lake plains. These soils formed in sandy glaciolacustrine sediments and the underlying till. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the sandy mantle and moderately low or moderately high in the till substratum. Slope ranges from 0 through 12 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 9.8 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is about 1025 millimeters.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harbor soils are on slight rises, convex flats, knolls, shoulders and back slopes on low beach ridges, offshore bars and deltas on Wisconsinan age lake plains. These soils formed in sandy glaciolacustrine sediments dominated by quartz derived from predominantly noncalcareous sandstones or from granitic rocks, and in the underlying low lime till. During the period of glacial lakes the till part of this soil was leveled and modified by wave action, and a thin stone line typically occurs at the contact of the lacustrine sediments and the till. Slope ranges from 0 through 12 percent. Elevations are from 180 through 250 meters above msl. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 950 through 1100 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 9.5 through 10.5 degrees C. The frost free period is 160 through 198 days."
