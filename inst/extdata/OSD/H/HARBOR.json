  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 30 through 65 inches. The depth to the till derived material is 20 through 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and Bw horizons, from 0 to 35 percent in the Bt horizon, and from 2 to 35 percent in the 2BC and 2C horizons. A thin stone line typically occurs at the contact of the sandy lacustrine sediments and the till. The calcium carbonate equivilent ranges from 1 through 10 percent. Depth to carbonates ranges from 30 through greater than 80 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 (6 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate, very fine through very coarse, granular. Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid. Areas that have been limed range through slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. In some pedons, subhorizons of uncoated sand grains have matrix with chroma of 2. Texture is commonly fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand, and less commonly loam or sand. Structure is weak, very fine through coarse, subangular blocky, granular or platy. Reaction is very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loam, or their channery or gravelly analogues. Structure is weak, fine through coarse, subangular blocky or platy. Reaction is strongly acid through neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, silt loam, or their channery analogues. Structure is weak or moderate, medium through very coarse, prismatic, subangular blocky or angular blocky. Reaction is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 through 4. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, silt loam, or their channery analogues. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harbor soils are on slight rises, convex flats, knolls, shoulders and back slopes on low beach ridges, offshore bars and deltas on Wisconsinan age lake plains. These soils formed in sandy glaciolacustrine sediments dominated by quartz derived from predominantly noncalcareous sandstones or from granitic rocks, and in the underlying low lime till. During the period of glacial lakes the till part of this soil was leveled and modified by wave action, and a thin stone line typically occurs at the contact of the lacustrine sediments and the till. Slope ranges from 0 through 12 percent. Elevations are from 570 through 750 feet above msl. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 through 39 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 49 through 52 degrees F. The frost free period is 160 through 198 days."

The somewhat poorly drained Conneaut and Painesville soils are on broad, convex flats on lower landscape positions. The very poorly drained Kingsville soils are in depressions on lower landscape positions. The sandy Elnora soils lack the till floor and are on similar landscape positions. The excessively drained Otisville and Tyner soils are on higher elevation beach ridges."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the sandy mantle and moderately low or moderately high in the till substratum. Depth to an intermittent perched seasonal high water table is 1.5 through 2.5 feet from December through April in most years."
