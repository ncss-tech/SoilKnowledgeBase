The Beaverdam, Jerry, and Sessions soils lack calcic horizons.  Blackhorse soils are carbonatic below 12 inches. Brinkert and Gothic soils range from 40 to more than 60 inches to uniformly calcareous material.  Buckskin soils are noncalcareous. Heath soils are not dry for 45 consecutive days in the 4 months that follow the summer solstice. Judy, Little Horn and Sneffels soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.   Mayoworth, Owen Creek, Piltz, and Trout Creek soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches or immediately below the solum if the solum is thicker than 40 inches. Youman soils have hues redder than 7.5YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Heathcoat soils are on fan terraces, hills, mountains and plateaus and have slopes of 1 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 6,500 to 8,500 feet.  The soils formed in uplifted lacustrine sediments, colluvium from shale, and alluvial deposits over glacial till.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry in summer. Average annual precpitation is 13 to 16 inches, and average annual temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 75 days."
