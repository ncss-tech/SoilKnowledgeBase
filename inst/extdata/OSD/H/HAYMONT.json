Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Elevations are 700 to 1,070 meters (2,300 to 3,500 feet). The climate is hot and arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 203 millimeters (3 to 8 inches); mean annual air temperature is 15 to 18 degrees C. (60 to 65 degrees F.), and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days."
