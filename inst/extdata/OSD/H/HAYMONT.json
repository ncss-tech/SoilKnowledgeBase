  "OVERVIEW": "The Haymont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources. The Haymont soils are on fan skirts, alluvial flats, axial stream floodplains, and lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degees C. (63 degrees F.).",
