  "OVERVIEW": "The Hayness series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in medium textured alluvium derived from red sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans, valley sideslopes, and toeslopes, and have slopes of 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The soil is typically calcareous throughout, but may be noncalcareous up to 7 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil and are mostly pebble and cobble sized sandstone fragments.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically a loam or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture of the particle-size control section is typically loam, silt loam, or clay loam, but clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent; silt from 20 to 60; and sand from 20 to 50 with more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
