Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The soil is typically calcareous throughout, but may be noncalcareous up to 7 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil and are mostly pebble and cobble sized sandstone fragments.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically a loam or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture of the particle-size control section is typically loam, silt loam, or clay loam, but clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent; silt from 20 to 60; and sand from 20 to 50 with more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Average annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches, and is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year.  PE Index is about 50 at the type location.  Average annual temperature ranges from 45 degrees to 50 degrees F., and average summer temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 65 degrees F."
