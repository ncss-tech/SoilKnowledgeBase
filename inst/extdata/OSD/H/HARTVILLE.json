  "OVERVIEW": "The Hartville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium or colluvium on high terraces, strath terraces, and foot slopes along major stream valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F.",

Jerktail soils have a lithic contact from 60 to 80 inches. Loudon soils have carbonates from 32 to 65 inches and have a lithic or paralithic contact from 40 to 70 inches.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hartville soils are on high stream terraces, strath terraces, and footslopes along major stream valleys.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium mainly from limestone and shale.  Slopes are linear and slightly concave.  Most areas receive runoff from higher adjacent areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature from 54 to 57 degrees F."

Freeburg and Moniteau soils are fine-silty and Razort soils are fine-loamy.  These soils are on lower terraces and floodplains below Hartville soils.  Gatewood soils are very-fine, Gunlock soils are moderately well drained and Ocie soils are loamy-skeletal over clayey.  These soils are on upland sideslopes and footslopes above the Hartville soils."

Permeability is slow, and the saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. A seasonal high water table is at 1.5 to 3.0 feet during the winter and early spring in most years.  Some areas are subject to rare flooding."
