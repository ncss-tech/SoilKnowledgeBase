    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 51 to 81 cm (20 to 32 in). Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm (60 in). Depth to carbonates ranges from 41 to 81 cm (16 to 32 in). Rock fragments are mainly gravel, cobbles, and channers of limestone and shale with lesser amounts of sandstone and siltstone. Rock fragment content in the solum ranges from 5 to 30 percent and includes up to 10 percent greater than 3 in in diameter. Rock fragment content in the C horizon ranges from 10 to 60 percent and includes up to 20 percent greater than 3 in in diameter. Rock fragments greater than 10 in in diameter cover 0 to 20 percent of the surface. Some pedons have a Cd or densic substratum that ranges from 51 to 97 cm (20 to 38 in).\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, medium or fine granular or subangular blocky structure, and friable or very friable consistence. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky, or granular. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bt/E horizon has colors and textures like the Bt horizon in the interiors of the peds. The E part of the horizon consists of silty exteriors of peds that have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction with clay content ranging from 18 to 28 percent. The Bt horizon has weak or moderate fine through coarse subangular blocky structure with some pedons having weak very thick platy structure. Consistence is friable or firm. Some pedons contain redoximorphic concentrations just above the C horizon. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons may have a BC horizon with colors, structure, consistence, and reaction similar to the B horizon, and textures similar to the C horizon.\nThe C or Cd horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. The C horizon is massive, or has weak or moderate, medium or thick plate-like divisions. It has friable through very firm consistence. Some pedons have redoximorpic features in the C horizon. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Aurora, Cazenovia, Conesus, Danley, Fairport, Hilton, Lansing, Lima, Madrid, Mohawk, Nunda, Ontario, Wampsville, Wassaic, and Yunenyeti series are similar soils in related families. Aurora, Conesus, Danley, and Nunda soils have redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 in of the argillic horizon. Cazenovia, Hilton, and Lima soils have evidence of saturation within 100 cm of the soil surface. Fairport, Wassaic, and Yunenyeti soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 in. Lansing and Ontario soils have thicker sola. Madrid soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Mohawk soils have Ap horizons with moist color value of 3 or less and dry value of 5 or less. Wampsville soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Honeoye soils are dominantly on gently undulating to rolling till plains. In some places they are on dissected side slopes of the upland plateau and in other areas they are on the top and upper side slopes of drumlins and convex ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent. These soils formed in till of late Wisconsin age derived from limestone, dolomite, and calcareous shale, and from lesser amounts of sandstone and siltstone. These soils are mainly on the low plateau in the northern part of the Applachain plateau, in the southern part of the Ontario Lowland and Mohawk Valley of New York. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C. (41 to 50 degrees F)., mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1440 millimeters (31 to 57 in), and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 100 to 190 days. Elevation ranges from 80 to 610 meters (250 to 1980 feet) above sea level."

Amboy, Dunkirk, and Hudson soils, and their wetter associates, formed in nearby lacustrine sediments. Lima, Appleton, Kendaia, and Lyons soils are the progressively wetter members of the same drainage sequence. Arkport and Colonie soils formed in nearby sandy deltaic deposits. Aurora soils have bedrock within a depth of 102 cm (40 in). Howard soils formed in outwash materials."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The more gently sloping Honeoye soils are among the most productive upland soils in New York State. The Honeoye series has been unofficially recognized as the state soil of New York.\nA new pedon from Onondaga County (the typical from the Onondaga Soil Survey) was used because the typical pedon did not match the typical pedon for Honeoye in the Ontario County, NY Soil Survey.\nCEC activity class changed from active to semi-active based on lab data for the Honeoye-Lima-Kendaia catena.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are as follows:\n(1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 20 cm (8 in) (Ap horizon).\n(2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 25 to 74 cm (10 to 29 in) (Bt/E and Bt horizons).\n(3) Glossic subgroup - as evidenced by interfingering of Albic material around peds in the upper part of the Argillic horizon (Bt/E horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data and engineering test data is available for several pedons from the Natural Resource Conservation Service, 12-PAS Soil Survey Office, Paul Smiths, New York.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
