  "OVERVIEW": "The Howcree series consists of soils that are well drained and very deep, that formed in alluvium from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  They are on terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 6 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
