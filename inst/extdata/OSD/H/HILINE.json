Coarse fragment content within the control section ranges from 0 to 30 percent with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble.  Reaction throughout the profile is very strongly acid or strongly acid with pH less than 5.5 (H20, 1:1).\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value moist from 3 to 4; and chroma moist of 2 or less.  Texture is silt loam stratified with fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and fine sand.  Coarse fragment content includes 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobble.\nThe C horizons have hue from 10YR to 5Y; value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam stratified with silt loam, sandy loam and fine sand.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 10 to 30 percent with 10 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble.  Red and brown mottles are often present along root channels.\nThe 2C horizon has hue from 10YR to 5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is stratified sand and gravel.  Small pockets of finer material and peat may be scattered throught the horizon.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 25 to 60 percent, with 15 to 40 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobble."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hiline soils are on nearly level floodplains and stream terraces.  The soils formed in stratified alluvium.  Most areas are subject to frequent overflow and many areas are affected by seepage from adjacent areas.  The climate is transitional from maritime to continental and is characterized by cool summers and by longmoderately cold winters.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 32 to 36 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 38 inches.  Slope is less than 2 percent."
