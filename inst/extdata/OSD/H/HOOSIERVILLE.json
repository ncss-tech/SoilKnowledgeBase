The soils formed in 127 to 178 cm (50 to 70 inches) of silty loess, 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches) of erosional sediments, and in the underlying paleosol in till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1067 to 1143 mm (42 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11.7 to 12.8 degrees C (53 to 55 degrees F)."

The well drained Alford soils and moderately well drained Arney and Muren soils are on higher lying positions on the landscape. The moderately well drained Ava and well drained Cincinnati soils are on lower lying shoulder slopes and backslopes, and these soils have fragipans. The somewhat poorly drained Iva and Lieber soils are on adjacent summits and shoulder slopes of interfluves. The well drained Hickory soils are on lower lying backslopes."

In drained areas, depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface between December and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and moderately low in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow in the lower part."
