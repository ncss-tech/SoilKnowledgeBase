  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoosierville series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in silty loess, erosional sediments, and in the underlying paleosol in till. Hoosierville soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
