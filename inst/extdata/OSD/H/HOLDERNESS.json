  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 46 degrees F.; mean summer soil temperature is about 63 degrees F.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches and thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is as shallow as 40 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It usually has granular structure but has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline (pH 6.0 to 7.6).\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is heavy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay or silty clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 20 percent rock fragments.  This horizon has prismatic or blocky structure. It is neutral or mildly alkaline (pH 6.8 to 7.8).\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline (pH 7.8 to 8.4) and usually has weak accumulation of visible secondary calcium carbonate below a depth of 42 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Holderness soils are on alluvial fans, foothill slopes or flood plains of intermittent streams.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in stratified alluvium derived principally from sedimentary rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches, about half of which falls during the months of April through August.  The average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost free period is 110 to 135 days.  Elevations range from 6,500 to 7,200 feet."
