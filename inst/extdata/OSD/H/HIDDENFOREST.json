  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Hiddenforest soils are on backslopes and footslopes of mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from quartzite. Elevations are 2,150 to 2,920 meters (7,050 to 9,580 feet). The climate is sub-humid continental, cool, with moist winters and common summer convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 320 to 420 millimeters (13 to 17 inches); mean annual air temperature is 6 to 10 degrees C. (43 to 50 degrees C.), and the frost-free season 100 to 150 days."
