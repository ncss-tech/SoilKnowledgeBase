  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock and solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The amount of coarse fragments, mostly sandstone, ranges from 0 to 15 percent in any horizon, except the BC and C horizons, where present, which range up to 35 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout, except surface layers that have been limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 8. Some pedons have a 1 to 4 inch A horizon that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is sandy loam, loam,\nsandy clay loam, or clay loam. The average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon or to bedrock commonly is 18 to 24 percent, but ranges from to 35 percent. The lower part commonly displays lithochromic mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow.\nThe BC, CB  or C horizons are similar in color and texture to the Bt horizon, except that they commonly become coarser with depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Emporia, Kempsville, and Smithdale series in the same family and the Apison, Biffle, Cahaba, Durham, Euharlee, Granville, Linker, Murfreesboro (T), Nauvoo, Pikecity (T), Pirum, Sipsey, Stringtown, and Suffolk series in a closely related family.  Apison, Biffle, and Sipsey soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches of the soil surface. Cahaba, Durham, Euharlee, Granville, Murfreesboro, Pikecity, Stringtown, Spadra, and Suffolk soils are deep to bedrock or paralithic contact. Linker soils are in a semiactive family and have Bt horizons with hues of 5YR or 2.5YR. Pirum soils have an irregular lower boundary over tilted and folded sandstone bedrock at depths between 22 and 55 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hartsells soils occur on broad smooth plateaus, mountaintops, or hilltops. Slopes are commonly between 3 and 8 percent, but range as low as 2 and as high as 25 percent. This soil formed in moderately coarse to medium textured residuum. The country rock consists of acid hard sandstone containing thin strata of shale or siltstone in places. Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is 61 degrees F. and the average rainfall is 56 inches."

Albertville, Enders, and Townley soils have more than 35 percent clay in their control sections. Crossville and Hector soils lack argillic horizons. Wynnville soils have a fragipan."

Some acreage is in pasture. More than one-fourth of the soil is forested; second-growth white, red, post, black, and chestnut oaks, tulip poplar, blackgum, and hickory and some pines are on areas that have remained continuously in forest, but loblolly and shortleaf pines are the principal cover in abandoned cropland and pasture."
