The 10- to 40-inch control section averages more than 50 percent by volume of limestone gravel.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 26 inches thick and includes all or part of the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2s  It is loam or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  The lower part of the Bw horizon contains less than 5 percent limestone pebbles.  Bk or BCk horizons are present in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 5 to 8 dry and 4 to 7 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."
