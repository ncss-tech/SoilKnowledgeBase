    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 14 inches thick.  Darker colors in the lower part of the pedon are inherent from the parent material.  The depth to tilled, nearly vertical slate and schist bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments, mainly slate and schist, range from 10 to 40 percent by volume in the upper 10 inches and 35 to 70 percent below and are dominantly channers and flagstones.  The soil does not have carbonates throughout and ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  The control section contains up to 25 percent mica by weight.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 (2 or 3 moist) and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam, channery loam, channery silt loam,  flaggy loam or flaggy silt loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 26 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5 Y; value of 4 or 5 (3 or 4 moist); and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam, loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and contains 35 to 60 percent by volume of fragments of rock.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 to 7 (2 to 6 moist) and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam and typically contains 40 to 70 percent by volume of fragments of rock."

All of the competing series in the same family do not have a significant amount of mica.  The Datino, Labre, Perma, and Slimbutte soils do not bedrock above 60 inches.  Peso soils and Wanagan soils have a Bk horizon.  Sandia soils have bedrock between depths of 40 and 60 inches.  Veatch soils have hard bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

The Cordeston and Marshdale soils occur in the swales and drainageways.  Cordeston soils have a mollic epipedon  more than 16 inches thick and the Marshdale soils have a high watertable.  The Pactola soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscapes that are forested."
