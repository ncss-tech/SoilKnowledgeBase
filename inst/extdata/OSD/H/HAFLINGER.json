  "OVERVIEW": "The Haflinger series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in cobbly coarse textured alluvium of volcanic origin.  These soils are on low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section dominantly is loamy sand or sand with 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is cobbly loam or cobbly sandy loam and averages 10 to 20 percent gravel and 15 to 30 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loamy sand, sand, or extremely cobbly sand, and averages 35 to 60 percent cobbles and 15 to 35 percent gravel."

The soils formed in coarse textured alluvium and outwash dominantly from basic igeneous origin with some volcanic ash.  The climate is humid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 65 to 75 inches.  The mean January temperature is 34 degrees F; mean July temperature is 64 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.
