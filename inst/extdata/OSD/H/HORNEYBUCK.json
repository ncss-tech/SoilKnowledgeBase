  "OVERVIEW": "The Horneybuck series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on headslopes, sinkholes, and saddles on ridges.  They formed in colluvium and valley fill.  Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
