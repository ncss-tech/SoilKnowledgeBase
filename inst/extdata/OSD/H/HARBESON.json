  "REVDATE": "03/2000",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Harbeson series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils in depressions and poorly defined drainageways.  They formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 72 to greater than 80 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the A horizon, from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the E horizon, and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Btg horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy sand, sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand, and their mucky analogs.  Thin 0 horizons (less than 5 inches thick) are in some pedons.  Mottles in shades of gray and brown are in the A horizon in some pedons.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 or less.  Texture is loamy sand, fine sand, and sand.  Mottles in shades of gray and brown are in the E horizon in some pedons.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nSome pedons may have a Cg horizon at depths greater than 72 inches.  Where present, the Cg horizon has hue of 5Y to 5BG, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1.  Texture is loamy sand or sand, and reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons this horizon contains few limestone or shell fragments."
