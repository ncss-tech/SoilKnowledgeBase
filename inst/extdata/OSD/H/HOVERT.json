  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Hovert soils are seasonally ponded but are dry for four or more months from July to November.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.\nSoil colors are in hues of 2.5Y to 5Y.  The E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chromas of 1 to 3.  It has textures of loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It has few to common yellowish brown redoximorphic concentrations.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has 50 to 60 percent clay, may have columnar structure and may be slightly calcareous.  It may have redoximorphic concentrations similar to the E horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It may have few segregations of lime and gypsum.  The C horizon is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Other similar soils include the Hoven and Shonkin series.  Hoven soils have a mollic epipedon and are poorly drained.  Shonkin soils have E horizons more than 5 inches thick, have a thick E and B mixed horizon transition to the Bt horizon, and do not have redoximorphic concentrations in the E horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Parent materials are calcareous, strongly alkaline clay with a high proportion of smectitic clay minerals."

None of these soils are ponded and all lack redoximorphic concentrations at the surface.  Kyle soils do not have an argillic horizon.  The Gilt Edge and Allentine soils have columnar natric horizons.  Bew and Renohill soils have argillic horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  \tDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 7 inches (after mixing) (E and Btn horizons); albic horizon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 3 inches (E horizon);  natric horizon - the zone from 3 to 14 inches (Btn horizon).  The Hovert soils are classified as having a natric horizon because the morphology of the soil is like that of the Hoven soils but lacks a mollic epipedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is lacking on the Hovert series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
