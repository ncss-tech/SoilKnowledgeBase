  "OVERVIEW": "The Hershal series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in stratified mixed alluvium weathered primarily from basalt and granite. Hershal soils are on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 24 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is silt loam with 12 to 18 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel. It has few to many distinct redox concentrations. The soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y and may be gleyed. It has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry. It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizon is very gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sand or very gravelly sand with 20 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles."
