  "OVERVIEW": "The Harpster series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in calcareous loess or glacial drift. They are on nearly level or depressional parts of outwash plains, till plains, glacial lake plains, or stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

Where drained, an apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 31 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. In undrained conditions, an apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Some pedons in the Harpster series do not have a calcic horizon that has 5 percent greater calcium carbonate content than the C horizon, but all pedons have at least 5 percent less calcium carbonate equivalent in some horizon below the calcic horizon. Flooded and nonponded phases are currently recognized. These soils will be evaluated during MLRA updating to determine if new series needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 46 cm (18 inches) (Apk and Ak horizons);\ncambic horizon - the zone from approximately 46 to 104 cm (18 to 41 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, and Bg4 horizons);\ncalcic horizon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 46 cm (18 inches) (Apk and Ak horizons);\naquic conditions - redoximorphic features present in the zone from approximately 46 to 152 cm (18 to 60 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, Bg4, Cg1, and Cg2 horizons)."
