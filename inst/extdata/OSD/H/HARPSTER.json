Chipman, Leen, and Logan soils are dry for more than 20 consecutive days in all parts of the soil moisture control section in at least 6 out of 10 years. Prophetstown soils contain 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Spaulding soils contain less than 7 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harpster soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional parts of till plains, outwash plains, lake plains, or stream terraces. Slopes typically are less than 1 percent but range to as much as 2 percent. The soils formed in calcareous silty material derived from loess or glacial drift. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 12.5 degrees C (45 to 54.5 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 1092 mm (29 to 43 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 195 days, and elevation ranges from 150 to 311 meters (492 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Brenton and Elburn soils are on higher parts of the landform. The poorly drained Drummer soils generally are on slightly higher lying parts of till plains or outwash plains. The poorly drained Hartsburg and Pella soils are on similar depressional areas on outwash plains or till plains."

Where drained, an apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 31 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time between January and May in most years. In undrained conditions, an apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface at some time between November and June in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Some pedons in the Harpster series do not have a calcic horizon that has 5 percent greater calcium carbonate content than the C horizon, but all pedons have at least 5 percent less calcium carbonate equivalent in some horizon below the calcic horizon. Flooded and nonponded phases are currently recognized. These soils will be evaluated during MLRA updating to determine if new series needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 46 cm (18 inches) (Apk and Ak horizons);\ncambic horizon - the zone from approximately 46 to 104 cm (18 to 41 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, and Bg4 horizons);\ncalcic horizon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 46 cm (18 inches) (Apk and Ak horizons);\naquic conditions - redoximorphic features present in the zone from approximately 46 to 152 cm (18 to 60 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3, Bg4, Cg1, and Cg2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
