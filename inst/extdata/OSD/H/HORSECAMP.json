  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F.  Cracks (1 to 7.5 cm wide) open and close each year and extend as deep as 40 inches or more forming large prisms.  The cracks remain open during June through December for about 200 days.  Few to many intersecting slickensides and tilted, wedge shaped aggregates occur at some depth between 10 and 40 inches.  Cobbles and stones on the surface range from 10 to 35 percent.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 20 to 35 inches.  Some pedons have discontinuous indurated silica and lime cementation at the lithic contact.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3; or 7.5YR 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 7.5YR 4/2.  It is clay or silty clay with a weighted average of 40 to 60 percent clay.  The A horizon is cobbly clay, cobbly silty clay, very cobbly silty clay or very cobbly clay.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles, range from 20 to 55 percent.\nThe Bw horizon, is 10YR 4/3 or 5/3 modified by 0 to 10 percent gravel.  They are silty clay, clay, or clay loam.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to 3 percent.\nThe Bk horizon is slightly to strongly effervescent, and lime is segregated in filaments, seams or threads.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 8 percent."

Doten and Ravendale soils are moderately well drained and have water tables sometime during the year or are ponded.  Brubeck soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to hard bedrock.  Karcal soils are 20 to 30 inches deep to hard bedrock and have cracks that remain open for about 120 days. Manogue soils are very slowly permeable and have secondary carbonates within 20 inches of the surface.   Moroni soils have cracks that remain open for 60 to 90 days and have 2.5Y hues.  Ravendale soils have cracks open 60 to 120 consecutive days in the summer and fall and have carbonates below 40 inches.  Waspo soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact."

Elevations are 4300 to 5800 feet.  The climate is cool semi-arid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  Annual snowfall is 20 to 30 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 26 degrees to 30 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 66 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 80 to 100 days."
