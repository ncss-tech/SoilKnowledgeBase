    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hagstadt soils are on foothills and terraces of uplands and in intermountain valleys. Elevations are 3,500 to 4,000 feet. Slopes are 4 to 25 percent. These soils formed in material derived from consolidated siltstone. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers. Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
