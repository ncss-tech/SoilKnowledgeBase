  "OVERVIEW": "The Hagstadt series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from consolidated siltstone. These soils are on foothills and terraces of uplands and in intermountain valleys. Slopes are 4 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils formed in material derived from consolidated siltstone. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers. Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches, much of which falls as snow and as spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
