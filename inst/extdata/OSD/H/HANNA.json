  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sola are typically 40 to 60 inches thick and range from 36 to 70 inches in thickness.  Few shale fragments are throughout the soil.  The amount of gravel in the sola ranges from less than 5 percent to 20 percent and occasionally up to 30 percent in the lower B horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4 and 2 through 4 chroma. It is a sandy loam or loam.  The A2 horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 3 through 5 chroma.  It is sandy loam or loam.\nThe B2t horizon has dominant hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 through 6 chroma.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less occur in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  It is dominantly loam and sandy loam and individual horizons are sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The Bt horizon averages between 14 and 18 percent clay.  It commonly has moderate or weak medium or coarse subangular blocky structure. This horizon ranges from strongly to very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon is typically stratified layers of sand, gravelly sand, sandy clay loam and loam and contains few to many shale fragments.  It commonly is medium or strongly acid.  Materials containing free carbonates occur at depths of 6 feet or more."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the only series in the family.  Alida, Bronson, Lydick, Oshtemo and Tracy soils are in closely related families.  Alida soils have darker colored surface soils.  Bronson soils have a higher base saturation.  Lydick soils have darker surfaces and lack low chroma mottles.  Oshtemo soils have a higher base saturation and lack low chroma mottles.  Tracy soils lack low chroma mottles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hanna soils are typically on level or nearly level topography.  Slopes are commonly 2 percent or less.  Hanna soils are formed in glacial outwash containing a high amount of shale fragments and a low amount of carbonates.  Summers are hot and winters are cold.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 57 degrees F. and annual average precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The Hanna soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Tracy and the poorly drained Quinn soils.  The Lydick and Alida soils are formed in similar materials and are transitional to Mollisols."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Hanna series was formerly classified as weakly developed Planosols in the region of Gray-Brown Podzolic soil.  More recently it has been classified as Typic Hapludalfs, fine-loamy, mixed, mesic.  The change to the present classification is based on a thorough study of these soils in LaPorte and Porter Counties where the series has dominantly been used.  To our knowledge the series has never been used in other states.  In areas where the series has dominately been used in the past, it will classify Aquultic Hapludalfs, coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
