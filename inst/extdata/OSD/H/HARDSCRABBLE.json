  "OVERVIEW": "The Hardscrabble series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in stratified loamy and clayey materials.  Hardscrabble soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The soil is usually moist but is dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the summer.  The solum is 35 to 60 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Depth to the clayey 2Bt argillic horizon is 12 to 24 inches.  The increase in clay from the BA horizon to the 2Bt1 horizon is 20 to 30 percent within 1 inch.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe BA horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, with 25 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay and averages 50 to 60 percent clay.  Rock fragments are weathered and range from 0 to 15 percent gravel or cobbles."
