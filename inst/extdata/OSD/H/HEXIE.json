The Dovecanyon, Friedliver, Goldivide, Goldpeak, Helendale, Jumborox, Searchlight, Sonoita, and Tray soils are all very deep soils and do not have a paralithic contact within 150 centimeters. Wingap soils have a paralithic contact between 100 and 150 centimeters, and a mean annual soil temperature of 15 to 18 degrees C. Goldpeak, Jumborox and Littlefargo soils also have a mean annual soil temperatures of 15 to 18 degrees C. In addition, Sonoita soils are moist greater than 20 days cumulative in some part of the soil moisture control section following summer convection storms. Friedliver soils have an upper boundary to the argillic between 25 and 50 centimeters, and Goldivide soils within 50 to 100 centimeters. Dovecanyon, Goldpeak, and Wingap soils do not have secondary carbonates within the series control section, while Tray soils are strongly to very strongly alkaline in all parts and have an argillic horizon with an ESP of 15 to 30."
