  "OVERVIEW": "The Humboldt series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Humboldt soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained.  Drained areas are a result of entrenchment of stream channels, impoundment of normal stream flow in reservoirs or diversion of water for irrigation.  Wet phases are recognized for pot hole areas that are inundated during flooding periods.  Drained phases are also recognized as a result of artificial drainage.  Water tables commonly range from 15 to 60 cm below the surface, but are deeper for drained phases.  The soils are usually subject to flooding one year out of two if unprotected.  Very slow runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity."

Native areas subject to periodic flooding produce native meadows consisting of creeping wildrye, basin wildrye, sedges and saltgrass.  These are either grazed or cut for meadow hay.  Greasewood, saltgrass, and alkali sacaton grow on the more salt and sodium affected areas."
