  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Humboldt soils are on flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with a component of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,190 to 1,965 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lovelock, Ocala, Placeritos, Rose Creek, Ryepatch and Sonoma soils.  Lovelock soils have mixed mineralogy with diatomaceous earth and volcanic ash in the clay fraction.  Ocala, Placeritos, and Sonoma soils are fine-silty and lack a mollic epipedon.  Rose Creek soils are coarse-loamy.  Ryepatch soils are very-fine and have cracks extending to a depth of more than 50 cm."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained.  Drained areas are a result of entrenchment of stream channels, impoundment of normal stream flow in reservoirs or diversion of water for irrigation.  Wet phases are recognized for pot hole areas that are inundated during flooding periods.  Drained phases are also recognized as a result of artificial drainage.  Water tables commonly range from 15 to 60 cm below the surface, but are deeper for drained phases.  The soils are usually subject to flooding one year out of two if unprotected.  Very slow runoff; moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Cropland, rangeland and wildlife habitat.  Large areas are leveled and cultivated.  Alfalfa, small grains, row crops and grass pastures are grown.  Native areas subject to periodic flooding produce native meadows consisting of creeping wildrye, basin wildrye, sedges and saltgrass.  These are either grazed or cut for meadow hay.  Greasewood, saltgrass, and alkali sacaton grow on the more salt and sodium affected areas."
