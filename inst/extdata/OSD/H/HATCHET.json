  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hatchet soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops at elevations of 2,800 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. These soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with residuum and colluvium from volcanic ash and igneous rock including porphoritic andesite, olivine basalt or hard andesitic alloclastic breccia.  Some Hatchet soils have a small admixture of pumice fragments.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 70 to 120 inches including considerable snowfall.  Average annual temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F.  Growing season (28 degrees F) is 70 to 140 days."
