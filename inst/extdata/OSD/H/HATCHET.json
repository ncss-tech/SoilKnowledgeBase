  "OVERVIEW": "The Hatchet series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from igneous rock and volcanic ash.  Hatchet soils are on mountain back slopes, shoulders, and ridgetops at elevations of 2,800 to 5,400 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
