  "OVERVIEW": "The Hopburn series consists of very deep, well drained soils on lava plains. Slopes are 1 to 12 percent. These soils formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash. Hopburn soils have moderately slow permeability. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

Spliten and Vadnais soils occur intermixed with the Hopburn soils. Spliten soils have mollic epipedons, lack argillic horizons and are 10 to 20 inches deep over hard bedrock. Vadnais soils have mollic epipedons, lack E horizons and are 20 to 40 inches deep over hard bedrock."
