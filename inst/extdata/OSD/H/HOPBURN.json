    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hopburn soils are on plains. The topography is undulating to rolling with slopes ranging from 1 to 12 percent. The soil formed in local alluvium derived dominantly from loess and volcanic ash. Elevations range from 6,300 to 6,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 24 to 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is 34 to 38 degrees F. The frost free period is 30 to 60 days."

They average less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser material throughout the particle-size control section and are 40 to 70 inches deep to the top of the argillic horizon. Spliten and Vadnais soils occur intermixed with the Hopburn soils. Spliten soils have mollic epipedons, lack argillic horizons and are 10 to 20 inches deep over hard bedrock. Vadnais soils have mollic epipedons, lack E horizons and are 20 to 40 inches deep over hard bedrock."
