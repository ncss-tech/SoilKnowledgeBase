These soils occur on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to steep pahoehoe flows that are 5,000 to 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1270 to 2032 millimeters (50 to 80 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 635 to 1016 millimeters (25 to 40 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 16 to 22 degrees C. (61 to 71 degrees F.)  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
