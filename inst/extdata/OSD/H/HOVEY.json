Hovey soils formed in silty alluvium or lacustrine sediments of mixed lithologic origin and that have been modified by limy ground water. They formed under a cool, continental climate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches, and most of it falls as snow. Mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., average January temperature about 26 degrees F., and average July temperature about 65 degrees F."
