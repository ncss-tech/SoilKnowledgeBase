  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hurst soils are on nearly level or gently sloping treads and sloping risers of lacustrine terraces and lake plains; mainly along major tributaries of the Mississippi River. Some areas are subject to flooding during rare or occasional high flood events. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 5 percent and range to 10 percent. Hurst soils formed in the dominantly clayey lacustrine sediments and have a mantle of loess or other silty material less than 61 centimeters (24 inches) in thickness. The lacustrine sediments in and underlying the Hurst series are weathered to depths of 10 or 12 feet. Below 203 centimeters (80 inches) the stratified lacustrine sediments have coarse structure and widely-spaced cleavage planes, slickensides and pressure faces, clay films on faces of structural units and in channels, segregation of iron-manganese oxides, accumulation of secondary carbonates, and the presence of dark strata. Mean annual air temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F), mean annual soil temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C (56 to 59 degrees F), mean annual precipitation is 914 to 1118 millimeters (36 to 44 inches), frost-free period is 180 to 210 days, and the elevation is 104 to 137 meters (340 to 450 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Colp, Geff, Okaw, Ridgway, Redbud, and Wagner series. The moderately well drained Colp soils are on more sloping parts of the same landform. The somewhat poorly drained Geff and well drained Ridgway soils contain less clay and more sand in the particle-size control section and are on stream terraces nearby. The poorly drained Okaw and Wagner soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional treads of the same landform. The Okaw and Colp soils form a hydrosequence with Hurst soils. The moderately well drained Redbud soils occur on slightly higher loess-covered lacustrine terraces nearby."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface water runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the silty material and low or moderately low (0.07 to 0.42 micrometers per second) in the clayey lacustrine sediments. Permeability is moderately slow in the silty material and very slow in the clayey lacustrine sediments. In drained areas, depth to an intermittent perched high water table is 15 to 61 centimeters (0.5 foot to 2.0 feet) from January to May in most years."
