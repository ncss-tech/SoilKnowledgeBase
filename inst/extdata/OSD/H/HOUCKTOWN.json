  "OVERVIEW": "The Houcktown series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are deep to dense till. They formed in loamy water-sorted material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and in the underlying till. They are on till plains, wave-worked till plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
