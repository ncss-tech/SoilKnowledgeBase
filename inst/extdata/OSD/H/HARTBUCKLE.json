  "OVERVIEW": "The Hartbuckle series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Hartbuckle soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).",
