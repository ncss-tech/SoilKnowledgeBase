  "OVERVIEW": "The Horsegrass series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock. These soils are on drainageways, flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degrees C.",
