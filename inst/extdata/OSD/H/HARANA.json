  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. Harana soils are dry for at least 60 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches within the 4 month period following the summer solstice. They are mildly to moderately alkaline and are calcareous in the upper part of the C horizon. The mollic epipedon is more than 20 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The profile to depth of 40 inches lacks rock fragments but few pebbles are below depth of 40 inches in some pedons. Hue commonly is 10YR but ranges to 7.5YR.\nThe A and C horizons to depth of 40 inches have value of 4 or 5 dry.  They are silty clay loam throughout with the control section averaging 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe C horizon below depth of 40 inches has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or less; high chroma mottles are in some pedons. It is sitly clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

Jett and Red Rock soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section. Also, Jett soils have chroma of 2 below depth of 20 inches. Keigley soils are strongly calcareous throughout and have more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Snow soils are neutral, noncalcareous and have 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section. Umpqua soils are neutral or slightly acid, noncalcareous and have chroma of 2 or 3."

The climate is semiarid and has hot dry summers and cold winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches. The average January temperature is about 27 degrees F. The average July temperature is about 74 degrees F. The mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F. The average frost free period is 120 to 140 days."
