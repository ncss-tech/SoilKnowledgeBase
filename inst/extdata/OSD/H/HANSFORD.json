  "OVERVIEW": "The Hansford series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine sediments of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are on playa floors.  Slope range is 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm (18 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F)",
