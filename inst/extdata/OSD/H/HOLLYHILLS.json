    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Hollyhills soils are on eroded summits of fan remnants. Slope ranges from 8 to 30 percent. The soils formed in material from mixed alluvium.  Elevations are 2,200 to 3,300 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Cajon, Coyote (T), Gravesumit (T), and Spider (T) soils. Arizo soils have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and are found in inset fans. Cajon soils do not have durinodes and are found in inset fans. Coyote soils are on similar landscape positions but have a well developed calcic horizon in addition to durinodes. Gravesumit soils are found on adjacent fans and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section with a calcic and an argillic horizon.  Spider soils are on summits and side slopes of the same landscape, have a sandy particle-size control section and have a zone which is characterized by duric properties."
