Hellwig soils formed in glaciofluvial sediments 51 to 102 cm thick and the underlying till from the St. Louis sub lobe of the Des Moines of the late Wisconsin glaciation. The mean annual air temperature is 3 to 5 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is 500 to 762 mm. Annual frost-free days range from 90 to 120. The elevation above sea level ranges from 300 to 400 meters."

The very poorly drained Baden soils are in shallow depressions, swales and along the edges of depressions of organic soils. The very poorly drained Cathro soils are in depressions.  The somewhat poorly drained Dusler soils are on slightly more convex positions and formed in fine-loamy till. The poorly drained Ellsburg, Melrude, and Schisler soils are on similar landscape positions. The Ellsburg soils formed in fine loamy till. The Melrude soils formed in loamy sediments 152 or more cm thick.  The Schisler soils formed in 51 to 102 cm of loamy sediments over loamy glacial till."
