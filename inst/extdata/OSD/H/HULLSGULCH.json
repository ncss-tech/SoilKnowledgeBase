Bissell soils are micaceous throughout, do not have lamellae and are 24 to 50 inches deep to substrata that is commonly stratified.. Bjork, Dodes, Pahrange, Noslo, Shoebend, and Uhaldi soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Cowiche soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon, have a 2Bk horizon with carbonate accumulation and do not have lamellae. Fernpoint soils have stratified extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly 2C horizons, secondary CaCO3 at 40 inches, and a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees. Indiano, Madras, Quiero and Simcoe soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Jerusalem soils do not have lamellae below the argillic horizon and have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent in some part. Margerum soils have pumice throughout the particle-size control section. Orr soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and do not have lamellae below the argillic horizon. Quailridge soils are less than 25 inches deep the base of the argillic horizon. Ralls soils are less than 25 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon and have silt loam and clay loam textures with less than 45 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Springmeyer and Truax soils are dry for more than 145 days during summer and fall and do not have lamellae. In addition, Truax soils have Bq horizons. Wenatchee soils have less than 20 percent medium and coarse sand in the particle-size control section and do not have lamellae."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hullsgulch soils are moderately sloping to very steep hill backslopes, summits and shoulders and on landslides at elevations of 2,700 to 3,900 feet. Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent. These soils formed in granitic sediments deposited as basin-margin subaqueous deltas. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches. The average annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 155 days."
