    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the clayey part of the Bt horizon ranges from 24 to 48 inches. Depth to the bottom of the clayey Bt horizon exceeds 30 inches. Depth to bedrock (R horizon) is more than 60 inches. The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons and extremely acid to strongly acid in the B and C horizons. Content of rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the A and E horizons, and 0 to 10 percent in the Bt and lower horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Horizons with value of 3 are less than 6 inches thick. The A horizon commonly is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. In some pedons, the A horizon is silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or red are in most pedons. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. The lower part of the Bt horizon also allows silt loam, loam, or clay loam. Some pedons have relict mottles in shades of gray or white in lower subhorizons.  The particle-size control section averages more than 30 percent silt, or more than 40 percent silt plus very fine sand, or less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10 YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8, or is mottled in shades of these colors. Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, red, gray, or white may occur. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, or is mottled in shades of white, gray, brown, yellow, or red. It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, silty clay loam saprolite."

Appling, Cecil, Hulett, Pacolet, and Wedowee soils have less than 30 percent silt in the control section. Aragon and Nectar soils formed in weathered limestone, sandstone, shale, or siltstone; also, Aragon soils have a Bt horizon that is mottled in the upper part. Cataula and Neeses soils have a layer that is partially dense and brittle. Chestatee soils have more than 15 percent by volume of coarse fragments throughout. Darley soils contain layers of fractured ironstone in the B horizon. Georgeville and Kolomaki soils have a Bt horizon with hue redder than 5YR; also, Kolomaki soils are on terraces on the southern Coastal Plain. Mahan soils formed in coastal plain sediments and have coarse fragments of ironstone. Spotsylvania soils have a lithologic discontinuity."
