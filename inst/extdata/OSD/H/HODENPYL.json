  "OVERVIEW": "The Hodenpyl series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy deposits overlying sandy deposits on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.1 degrees C (45 degrees F).",
