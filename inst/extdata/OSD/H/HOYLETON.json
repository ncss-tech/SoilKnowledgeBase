  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hoyleton soils are on low convex ridges of Illinoian till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. These soils formed in 76 to 140 cm (30 to 55 inches) of loess and the underlying silty or loamy deposits. The loess is late Wisconsinan Peoria silts, and the underlying silty or loamy deposits are early Wisconsinan Roxana silts. Hoyleton soils are commonly underlain at depths of about 152 to 213 cm (5 to 7 feet) by a strongly weathered Sangamon age paleosol in Illinoian age till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F). Elevation is 122 to 213 meters (400 to 700 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bluford, Cisne, Darmstadt, Huey, and Richview soils. Bluford soils have fragic soil properties, have a lighter colored surface layer, and are on similar nearby low convex ridges or on more nearly level parts of the till plain. Cisne and Huey soils are poorly drained and are on more nearly level or lower lying parts of the till plain. Also, Huey soils have a natric horizon. Darmstadt soils have a natric horizon; they are in an intricate pattern with Hoyleton soils on some broad convex ridges. Richview soils are better drained and are on higher or more sloping ridges."
