  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoyleton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on till plains. They formed in loess and the underlying pedisediment. Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 millimeters (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
