  "OVERVIEW": "The Hungrygulch series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granitic rock. Hungrygulch soils are on mountains with slopes of 30 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
