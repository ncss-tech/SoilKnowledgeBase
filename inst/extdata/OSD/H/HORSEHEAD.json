  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Horsehead series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in gravelly and sandy glaciofluvial deposits on outwash plains, outwash channels, river and stream terraces, eskers, kames, deltas, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C (42 degrees F).",
