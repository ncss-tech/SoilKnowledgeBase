Atring soils are dry 45 to 60 days and have angular rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have a paralithic contact.  Baldhill, Barpeak, and Farber soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock. Geppert and Straight soils have a paralithic contact.  In addition, Straight soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  Clallam soils are moderately well drained and have a paralithic contact.  Hartless, Kanid, Kindig, and Terbies soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock.  Inskip soils have less than 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Mayacama soils are dry for 120 days.  Neuns, Sheetiron, and Woodin soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days.  Beekman and Vena soils contain angular rock fragments.  Beekman soils are over metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks.  Vena soils are formed over rhyolitic tuff."
