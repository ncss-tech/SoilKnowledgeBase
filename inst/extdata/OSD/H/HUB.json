  "OVERVIEW": "The Hub series consists of deep or very deep, well to moderately well drained soils with moderate to slow permeability.  These soils formed in thick noncalcareous alluvial fan or slope wash materials derived mainly from sedimentary bedrocks and are on alluvial fans and valley side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

The Beardall, Fugawee, and Shirat series all differ in having a lithic contact above 100 cm or immediately below the solum if the solum is thicker than 100 cm.  The Bramard series differs in lacking an albic horizon, in lacking any E/B horizons, in having an umbric epipedon, and in being strongly acid in the Bt and C horizon.  The Dukon series differs in lacking continuous E horizons, in having coarser textured C horizons above 100 cm and in having developed from sediments weathered from granite and containing a high proportion of medium and coarse angular sand."
