  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is more than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid except for the surface layer where limed.  Fragments of sandstone or chert ranges from 0 to 15 percent to a depth of about 40 inches and 0 to 40 percent below.  Some pedons have a stone line at the base of the alluvial deposit.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4 or value of 3 and chroma of 4..  Some pedons have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma  of 4 to 8.  It is dominantly loam or clay loam and is rarely sandy clay loam or silty clay loam.  Below about 40 inches the Bt horizon also has hue of 5YR and texture of clay.  Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow and red and the lower part may have a few gray mottles."

Addielou soils have an E horizon greater than 16 inches thick.  Allen, Avilla, Boma, Nella, Orangeburg, Pikeville, Ruston and Smithdale soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the major part of the B horizon.  Etowah soils have an Ap horizon with value of 3.  Leesburg and Minvale soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the B horizon.  Noboco soils have low chroma mottles in the lower Bt horizons.  Norfolk is a very close competitor that formed in Coastal Plain sediments and typically has a higher sand content throughout.  Octavia soils have a clayey 2Bt horizon.  Claiborne and Nolichucky soils have hue of 5YR or redder and are mesic.  Warnock soils have brittle lower Btx horizons containing plinthite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Holston soils are on nearly level to moderately steep stream terraces that are commonly rather high above the floodplains, and on foot slopes and benches in the uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soil formed in several feet of loamy alluvium or colluvium.  At the type location, mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is approximately 50 inches."
