  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock (lithic contact) is 40 to 60 inches below the mineral soil surface. Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle ranges from 7 to 14 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.   The particle-size control section is 18 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent hard medasedimentary and sedimentary channers and pebbles.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It has 0 to 10 percent hard channers and/or pebbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  When moist values range from 3 to 3.5 moist chromas are greater than 3.5. It contains 0 to 10 percent unweathered channers and/or pebbles.\nThe 2BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 10 percent hard channers and/or pebbles and 0 to 15 percent soft weathered channers and/or pebbles.\nThe Bt part of the 2Bt/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  The E part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  Both are silt loam or loam and are 0 to 10 percent hard channers and/or pebbles and 10 to 20 percent soft weathered channer and/or pebble fragments.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 dry or moist.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam and is 0 to 35 percent hard unweathered channers or pebbles and 5 to 20 percent soft weatheed channer and/or pebble fragments.\nThe 2BCt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10Yr, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam and is 15 to 35 percent hard unweathered channers and/or pebbles and 10 to 20 percent soft weathered channer and/or pebble fragments.  Some pedons lacking clay films have 2BC horizons rather than 2BCt horizons."

Similar soils in other families are the Bograp (T), Brusher, Cavendish (T), Fugawee, Kaiders, Ketchly, Kyburz, Martis, McEwen, Nahahum, Nard, Panak (T), Tahoma, and Wintoner series.  Bograp soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR.  Brusher soils lack channers and have 0 to 25 percent mostly fine pebbles in the particle-size control section. Cavendish soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR.  Kaiders soils lack a mantle of volcanic ash and are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  Fugawee and Kyburz soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 incehs.  Ketchly soils have 10 to 20 percent shot in the A horizon, have argillic bands in the B and C horizon and are very friable throughut.  Martis soils have an umbric epipedon.  McEwen soils have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the Bt horizon.  Nahahum soils lack a volcanic ash mantle. Nard soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments throughout the profile.  Panak soils have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the A and Bt horizons and lack a volcanic ash mantle.  Tahoma soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid in the Bt horizon. Wintoner soils have a solum 30 to 40 inches thick and a hue of 10YR throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Henneway soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of foothills and mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rock with a mantle of volcanic ash.   Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. Elevations range from 2,400 to 3,700 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperture is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
