  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum and depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches. The average annual soil temperature at lithic contact is about 45 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall. The particle-size control section averages 45 to 75 percent angular basalt fragments by volume and is 35 to 50 percent clay in the fine earth fraction. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and includes all of the argillic horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 through 3 moist. It is loam, silt loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 0 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe A2 horizon is clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent stones, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 25 to 45 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 0 to 5 percent stones, 15 to 40 percent cobbles, and 30 to 45 percent gravel."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ateron, Camool (T), Canest(T), Chen, Douhide, Graley, Itca, Vennob and Wallsburg. Ateron soils have a mollic epipedon that does not include the argillic horizon. Canest soils are 5 to 10 inches deep to a lithic contact. Chen, Douhide, and Graley soils have aridic moisture regimes bordering on xeric. Itca soils are not mollic in the lower part of the Bt horizon and have prismatic structure. Wallsburg soils lack basalt fragments and have more than 50 percent sandstone, shale and limestone fragments in the particle-size control section. Camool soils have a surface layer 5 to 9 inches thick that meets Vitrandic subgroup criteria. Vennob soils have a mollic epipedon 7 to 10 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Harlow soils are on canyons, structural benches, and basalt plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 90 percent. These soils formed in loess and colluvium and slope alluvium from basalt or argillite. Elevation ranges from 2,800 to 6,200 feet. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 40 inches. Average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. Frost-free season is 50 to 115 days."
