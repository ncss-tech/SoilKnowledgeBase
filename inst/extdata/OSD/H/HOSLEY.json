  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 degrees to 50 degrees F. The soils have an aquic moisture regime.  Exchangeable sodium exceeds 15 percent in all or part of the upper 20 inches decreasing with depth below the duripan and commonly it is at a maximum in the natric horizon. The solum is calcareous in all parts at depths between 10 and 20 inches. Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 dry. It is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist. This horizon is clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent clay. It has prismatic or angular or subangular blocky structure and has faint to distinct thick clay films on surfaces of peds. This horizon is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe duripan is plate-like, has an indurated laminar cap 1 to 5mm thick, and coatings of opal. The lower part of the duripan commonly is weakly cemented."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hosley soils are on low terraces in basins.  Elevations are 4,050 to 4,200 feet. The soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from diatomite, tuff, basalt, and ash. The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. The mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Calimus, Fordney, Henley, and Laki soils. Calimus, Fordney, and Laki soils lack duripans and natric horizons. Calimus soils also are well drained and nonsodic.  Fordney soils are excessively drained, nonsodic, and have sandy control sections. Henley soils have ochric epipedons, lack natric horizons, and average 18 to 25 percent clay. Laki soils are moderately well drained and have exchangeable sodium percentages that are erratic throughout the profile."

Cambic horizon - from 12 to 16 inches (Bk horizon).\nNatric horizon - from 16 to 26 inches (Btk horizon).\nDuripan - from 26 to 42 inches (Bkqm horizon).\nSeries revised 5/90.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
