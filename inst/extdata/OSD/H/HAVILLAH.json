  "OVERVIEW": "The Havillah series consists of moderately deep to a densic contact, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over calcareous glacial till. They are on till plains and mountains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
