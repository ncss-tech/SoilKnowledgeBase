  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the profile, unless limed. Limed soils typically are slightly acid or neutral in the upper part of the profile. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the A and E horizons, and from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the B and C horizons. Fragments are dominantly pebbles in size. Most pedons have none to common flakes of mica in the A, E, and Bt horizons, and few to many flakes of mica in the BC and C horizons. Content of plinthite nodules ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the lower Bt and BC horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Severely eroded phases are sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon typically has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, with chroma 3 restricted to hue of 10YR. Some pedons have hue of 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6 in some subhorizons; some pedons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6 in the lower subhorizons. Masses of oxidized iron in shades of red, yellow, and brown range from few to many in most pedons. Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are below a depth of 30 inches. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay. The Bt horizon contains 35 to 60 percent clay.\nThe BC horizon is multicolored in hues of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8, with iron depletions in shades of gray and brown. Some pedons have masses and streaks of white stripped kaolinite. Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, is similar in color to the BC horizon. Some pedons have masses and streaks of white stripped kaolinite. Texture is loamy saprolite weathered from felsic igneous and metamorphic rock."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Cataula series in the same family. Soils in closely related families include the Appling, Bush River, Cecil, Colfax, Helena, Madison, Lloyd, Pacolet, Prosperity, Santuc, Vance, Wedowee, and Whistlestop soils. Cataula soils are dominantly red in color. Appling, Cecil, Madison, Lloyd, Pacolet, Vance, and Wedowee soils do not have a seasonal high water table within a depth of 60 inches. Colfax soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a fragipan. Helena and Santuc soils have seasonal high water tables at depths of 18 to 30 inches; additionally, Santuc soils are in a fine-loamy family. Bush River and Prosperity have a paralithic contact within 60 inches. Whistlestop soils have mixed mineralogy and are found on stream terraces."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hard Labor soils are on broad nearly level to gently sloping summits and on sloping to strongly sloping side slopes in the southern Piedmont. Slopes typically range from 2 to 10 percent, but include slopes of 0 to 15 percent. Hard Labor soils formed in material weathered from felsic igneous and metamorphic rock. Mean annual temperature is in the range of 59 to 62 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is in the range of 45 to 50 inches."

Appling, Cecil, Lloyd, Pacolet, Vance, and Wedowee soils are on landform positions similar to, and steeper than those of the Hard Labor soils. Colfax soils are in shallow depressions, on toe slopes, and around the heads of drainageways. Bush River, Helena, and Prospereity soils are in landform positions similar to those of the Hard Labor soils, as well as on toe slopes, and around the heads of drainageways. Altavista soils are moderately well drained, fine-loamy, and on low stream terraces. Toccoa soils are in a coarse-loamy family and on flood plains. Wehadkee soils are poorly drained, fine-loamy, and on flood plains."
