  "OVERVIEW": "The Hollenbeck series consists of deep to duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Hollenbeck soils are on basin rims and interfan basins.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The soils have 1 to 4 cm wide cracks that open and close at least once each year and remain open from June to October, unless irrigated.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 62 degrees to 63 degrees F. Manganese concretions and stains are few to common below the Ap.\nThe A and Bss horizons are 10YR 5/2, 4/2, 4/3, 3/2; 7.5Y 5/2, 4/2 and moist colors is 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  They are clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5Y 4/4 and moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/3; or 7.5YR 3/4.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam.

They formed in moderately fine and fine textured alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils are in a dry climate of relatively hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Dense ground fog often occurs during the winter months.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F., mean July temperature is 77 degrees F, mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 260 to 290 days."
