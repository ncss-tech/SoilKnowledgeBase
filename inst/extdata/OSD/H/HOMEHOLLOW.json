  "OVERVIEW": "The Homehollow series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt and an influence of volcanic ash on the surface. Homehollow soils are on lava plains and have slopes of  0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
