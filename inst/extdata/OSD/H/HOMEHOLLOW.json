These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt with an ash influence on the surface.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
