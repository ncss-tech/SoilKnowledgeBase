Armenia soils have BC horizons in the lower part of the B horizon with Fe-Mn concretions, are slightly acid to mildly alkaline and noneffervescent, and are moist in the moisture control section most of the summertime.  Bolfar soils are fine-loamy and do not have an argillic horizon.  Britto, Orestimba, Pescadero, and Pedcat soils have natric horizons.  Dosamigos soils have more than 15 ESP in the C horizon and lack an argillic horizon.  Stanislaus soils are well drained and lack an argillic horizon."

These soils are being differentiated by having a mollic epipedon and less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  EC and ESP determined by saturation extract and versenate titration.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HC1 solution.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nLast revised by the state on 5/85.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
