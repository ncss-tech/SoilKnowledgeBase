These soils are being differentiated by having a mollic epipedon and less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  EC and ESP determined by saturation extract and versenate titration.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HC1 solution.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nLast revised by the state on 5/85."
