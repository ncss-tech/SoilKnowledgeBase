The moisture control section of 5 to 14 inches is moist throughout from about January 1 to June 1 and dry throughout from about July 1 to November 1.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees F.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F in parts of January and February but is never below 41 degrees F at anytime.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2; or 2.5Y 3/2.  It ranges from 19 to 35 percent clay content.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Armenia series in the same family and the Bolfar, Britto, Dosamigos, Dospalos, Orestimba, Pescadero, Pedcat, and Stanislaus series in other families.  Armenia soils have BC horizons in the lower part of the B horizon with Fe-Mn concretions, are slightly acid to mildly alkaline and noneffervescent, and are moist in the moisture control section most of the summertime.  Bolfar soils are fine-loamy and do not have an argillic horizon.  Britto, Orestimba, Pescadero, and Pedcat soils have natric horizons.  Dosamigos soils have more than 15 ESP in the C horizon and lack an argillic horizon.  Stanislaus soils are well drained and lack an argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They are on nearly level topography.  Elevations are 95 to 110 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches and occurs only in the winter months.  The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 79 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."

These soils are being differentiated by having a mollic epipedon and less than 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  EC and ESP determined by saturation extract and versenate titration.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HC1 solution.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nLast revised by the state on 5/85.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
