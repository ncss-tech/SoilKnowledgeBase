  "OVERVIEW": "The Holman series consists of deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and quartz.  Holman soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches.",
