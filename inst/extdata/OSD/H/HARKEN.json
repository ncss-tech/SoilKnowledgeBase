  "OVERVIEW": "The Harken series consists of deep to cemented glacial outwash, moderately well drained soils that formed in slackwater deposits over glacial outwash on high stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 10 percent.  The average\nannual precipitation is about 110 inches and average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, and are dry 30 to 45 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section.  Depth to cemented outwash is 40 to 60 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has andic soil properties with a cumulative thickness of 14 to 20 inches and 0 to 20 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 15 to 25 percent for air dried samples and acid oxalate iron of 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry and value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry.  It has 10 to 20 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist.  It is medial silt loam.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.  It has 7 to 12 percent organic matter decreasing to less than 7 percent within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface.\nThe 2Bw horizon has color similar to the Bw horizons.  It is silty clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.  It is assumed to have a bulk density of over 0.90 g/cubic centimeter and thus does not meet andic soil properties.\nThe 3Bsm horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely cobbly loamy sand.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe 3C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly sand, extremely cobbly sand, or extremely gravelly loamy sand.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid."
