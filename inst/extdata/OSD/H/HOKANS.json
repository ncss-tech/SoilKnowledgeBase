  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hokans series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till of the Late Wisconsin glaciation.  These soils are on nearly level to gently undulating moraines on till plains.  Slope ranges from 1 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C (41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 665 millimeters (26 inches).",
