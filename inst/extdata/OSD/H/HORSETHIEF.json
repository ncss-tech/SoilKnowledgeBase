    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 2 to 24 inches.  (A, E1, and E2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 32 to 49 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nPale feature:  The top of the argillic horizon is 24 inches or more below the mineral surface.\nParticle size control section:  the zone from 32 to 49 inches.  (the argillic horizon)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998\nType location is moved from La Plata Soil Survey Area to Animas-Dolores Soil Survey Area in 1996.\nThe 4/2002 revision narrows the series concept to include only a typic-udic moisture regime. Outwash and till were also deleted from the parent materials. Vegetation was revised to reflect only the vegetation representative of typic-udic. It is recognized that more narrowing of the concept is needed, particularly to exclude soil properties that correspond to the precip zones and parent materials that are no longer part of the series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
