  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradient ranges from 1 to 12 percent. These soils formed in Late Sangamon paleosols formed in sandy loam, loam, or clay loam Illinoian glacial till and residuum from weathered limestone bedrock, except the upper 25 to 64 cm (10 to 25 inches) above the 2B is formed in loess. Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual temperature is between 7.2 and 13.9 degrees C (45 and 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Ogle or Tama soils commonly occur on ridgetops upslope from the Hitt soils where the loess mantle is thicker. Durand and Winnebago soils occur in many places with Hitt soils in similar side slope positions, where the drift is thicker. Dodgeville soils occur on steeper slopes or on similar slopes where glacial deposits do not occur above the bedrock. Hitt is the dark colored member of a biosequence containing Oneco and Woodbine series."
