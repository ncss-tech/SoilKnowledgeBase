  "OVERVIEW": "The Hitt series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess, glacial till, and residuum weathered from bedrock on uplands. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
