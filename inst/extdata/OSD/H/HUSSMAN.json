    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hussman soils are on low stream terraces.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,465 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
