  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to free carbonates typically is 36 to 48 inches, and ranges from 26 to 60 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 20 percent by volume in most parts of the solum.  Most of the fragments are gravel size with some cobblestones and occasional boulders present.  They are of mixed lithology but mostly igneous.  A horizons in some pedons contain as little as 2 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is commonly sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate granular, crumb, or subangular blocky structure and is friable or very friable.  Reaction ranges from neutral to medium acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, and less commonly loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium crumb, platy or subangular blocky structure.  It is friable or very friable and ranges from slightly to strongly acid.  Some pedons have thin BE horizons as expressed by ped coatings and interfingering.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  It has moderate or weak blocky or platy structure.  It is friable or firm, and slightly hard or hard when dry.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  It has few to many thin or moderately thick dark brown clay films on faces of peds and voids.  It ranges from strongly acid to neutral in reaction.  Some pedons have BC horizons.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam, with thin coarser textured strata common.  It has weak platy structure or is massive displaying horizontal fracture.  It is friable or very friable and slightly hard or hard.  It is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Most pedons have fine soft lime threads and masses."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Dorset, Flak, Growton, Heyder, Nebish, and Waukon soils are closely related.  Dorset soils have sandy or sandy skeletal textures within depths of less than 24 inches.  Flak soils have firm or very firm consistence in the lower part of the B horizon and C horizon.  Growton soils have mottles with chroma of 2 in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon.  Heyder soils lack Ap horizons 7 inches thick with color value of 3 or less.  Nebish and Waukon soils are fine-loamy."

The soils formed in calcareous sandy loam or loam glacial till.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 23 to 32 inches."
