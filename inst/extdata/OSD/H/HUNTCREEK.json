  "OVERVIEW": "The Huntcreek series consists of moderately deep to dense till, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium over dense alpine glacial till derived from metasedimentary rock.  Huntcreek soils are on glacial valleys.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 110 inches and average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
