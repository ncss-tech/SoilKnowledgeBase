  "OVERVIEW": "The Horselake series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from shale.  Horselake soils are on low shale hills.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
