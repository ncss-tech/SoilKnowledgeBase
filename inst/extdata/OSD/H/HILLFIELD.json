The laminated lake terrace materials extend to within a few inches of the surface in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 3.5 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly to strongly calcareous.  This horizon contains 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is often quite stratified, ranging from fine sand to clay loam or silty clay loam."

They formed in lake sediments from a mixture of rocks, dominantly quartzite, gneiss, granite, limestone, and sandstone. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F., and the average summer temperature ranges from 66 to 72 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 100 to 175 days.  Elevation is 4,200 to 5,200 feet."
