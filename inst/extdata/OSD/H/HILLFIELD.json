  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The moisture regime is Xeric bordering on Aridic.\nThe average texture of the 10 to 40 inch control section is silt loam with less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The laminated lake terrace materials extend to within a few inches of the surface in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 3.5 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly to strongly calcareous.  This horizon contains 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, and 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is often quite stratified, ranging from fine sand to clay loam or silty clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hillfield soils are on lake terraces and escarpments with slopes of 4 to 60 percent.  They formed in lake sediments from a mixture of rocks, dominantly quartzite, gneiss, granite, limestone, and sandstone. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F., and the average summer temperature ranges from 66 to 72 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 100 to 175 days.  Elevation is 4,200 to 5,200 feet."

The dry farmed areas are in alfalfa or small grains.  Under irrigation, forage crops and orchards are the principal crops. The native vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, oakbrush, western wheatgrass, Indian ricegrass, three awn grass, sand dropseed, and cheatgrass."
