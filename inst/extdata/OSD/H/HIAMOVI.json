(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)  When described on August 27, 1996, the soil was dry.\nThe surface is covered by about 10 percent boulders, 10 percent stones, 3 percent cobbles, and 2 percent gravel.\nE--0 to 5 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 5/3) moist; weak fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; 55 percent gravel and 10 percent cobbles; strongly acid (pH 5.2); abrupt smooth boundary.  (4 to 6 inches thick)\nBw--5 to 13 inches; very pale brown (10YR 7/3) extremely gravelly sandy loam, brown (10YR 4/3) moist; weak medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine, medium and coarse roots; 65 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles and 5 percent stones; strongly acid (pH 5.2); clear irregular boundary.
