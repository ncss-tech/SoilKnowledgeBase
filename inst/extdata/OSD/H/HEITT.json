    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to rock ranges from 40 to more than 72 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to medium acid, in the solum and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.  Coarse fragments in the substratum range from 0 to 35 percent in the upper part and 25 to 75 percent in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nWhen present, the AB or BA horizon, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is 0 to 10 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8, with mottles in shades of red, brown and yellow.  Some pedons have gray mottles below the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Texture is silty clay or clay.\nWhen present, the BC or CB horizon has color and texture similar to the lower Bt horizon or C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Texture is silty clay or clay."

Beasley, Brashear, Brookside, Lowell, Markland, and Woodsfield soils lack B horizons with colors as red as 5YR hue.  Bland, Bratton, Caneyville, Chrome, Derinda, Donahue, Eden, Edenton, Faywood, Fredonia, Milton, Shrouts, and Wynn are less than 40 inches to a paralithic or lithic contact.  Briggsville soils have stratified silty clay loam C horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bucklick soils have warmer temperatures and less rainfall in July and August and higher Thornthwaite P-E indices.  Elba and Medary soils lack carbonates within depths of 10 to 30 inches.  Eldean, Miamian, Losantville, and Ozaukee soils formed in glacial material and have angular or rounded rock fragments of mixed lithology.  Bledsoe, Gunlock, Hagerstown, and Newnata have thicker sola.  Lamoille soils contain rounded cobbles, gravel and some chert in the lower part of the solum and substratum.  Markland soils formed in lacustrine sediments and lack coarse fragments.  Kewaunee, Upshur and Vincent soils have lower B and C horizons in hue of 5YR or redder.  Vandalia soils have sola with 10 to 40 percent coarse fragments."
