  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Harrisville soils are on smooth to undulating low lake terraces.  These soils have formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary rocks such as limestone and sandstone; igneous rocks such as granite; and metamorphic rocks such as quartzite and gneiss.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations range from 4,250 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 120 to 170 days."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Harrisville soils are used for rangeland, irrigated cropland, and urban development.  Irrigated areas are used for growing alfalfa, small grains, sugar beets, and improved pasture.  The native vegetation in rangeland is mainly Sandberg's bluegrass, inland saltgrass, foxtail, gumweed, peppergrass, black greasewood, and Wyoming big sagebrush."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\nNatric horizon - The zone from 8 to 22 inches (Btn and Btkn horizons).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 14 to 33 inches (Btkn and Bkn horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 60 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bkn, C1, and C2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 22 inches (Btn and Btkn horizons).\nThis revision of February 2006 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Mollic Natrustalfs based on the presence of a mollic epipedon and the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 138-139, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from the original pedon description.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
