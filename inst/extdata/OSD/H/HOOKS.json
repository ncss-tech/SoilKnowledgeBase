  "OVERVIEW": "The Hooks series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Hooks soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
