  "OVERVIEW": "The Haverdad series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified alluvium on flood plains and low terraces.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
