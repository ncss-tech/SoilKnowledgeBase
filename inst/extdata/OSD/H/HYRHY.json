  "OVERVIEW": "The Hyrhy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt.  Hyrhy soils are on basalt lava flows with slopes of 2 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
