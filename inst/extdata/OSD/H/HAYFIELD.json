  "STATES": "IL,IA,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hayfield series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash.  These soils are on linear or concave slopes on outwash plains, valley trains, treads and risers on stream terraces, and glaciated uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.",
