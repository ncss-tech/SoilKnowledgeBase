    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 14 to 28 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches and varies widely within short horizontal distances.  Content or rock fragments range from 0 to 50 percent in the A horizon, 5 to 40 percent in the Bw horizon, and 20 to 50 percent in the C horizon but averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Some pedons contain hard schist stringers.  Flakes of mica are in the B and C horizon.  The soil is strongly or very strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The Ap horizon where present has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The A or Ap  horizon is loam, silt loam, or sandy laom in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Some pedons contain high chroma mottles. The B horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is multicolored without a dominant matrix color, or it has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8.  The C horizon is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction."

Slope gradients range from 2 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in materials weathered from graywacke, metasediments, and phyllites, with minor amounts of mica schist, mica gneiss, and slate.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 degrees to 59 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches."
