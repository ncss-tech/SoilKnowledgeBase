  "OVERVIEW": "The Hochheim series consists of well drained soils which are shallow to a densic contact with till. These soils formed in loamy till, typically with a thin loess mantle, on drumlins and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Where the loess mantle is thicker, Theresa soils are common associates in less sloping areas."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\n7/04  There are 226,199 acres correlated in 10 surveys in Wisconsin. No moderately well drained acres have been correlated. Therefore, this revision redefines this series as well drained only. Also, based on lab data from three Hochheim pedon and from four pedons of a related series (Theresa) in the same till, the concept of the till is changed to densic material (2Cd).\nLaboratory data is available from four pedons. The data shows a cation-exchange activity class of active in two pedons and superactive in the others. The data also shows a dry bulk density of 1.8 to 2.0 in the C horizon within depths of 102 cm (40 inches) for three pedons. Lab data is needed from additional pedons to verify cation-exchange activity class.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches) (Ap)\nargillic horizon - 18 to 41 cm (7 to 16 inches) (2Bt1, 2Bt2)\nmoisture regime - mesic\ntemperature regime - udic."
