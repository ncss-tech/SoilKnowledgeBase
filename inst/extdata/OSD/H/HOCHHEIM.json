    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hochheim soils are on convex slopes on large drumlins and sloping ground moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in loamy till typically with a thin loess mantle.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 838 mm (26 to 33 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.6 degrees C (45 to 51 degrees F)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Casco, Lamartine, Nenno and Theresa soils.  The Casco soils are on similar landscapes with calcareous gravelly outwash below. The somewhat poorly drained Lamartine and Nenno soils form a drainage sequence on gentle gradients with the Hochheim soils.  Where the loess mantle is thicker, Theresa soils are common associates in less sloping areas."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\n7/04  There are 226,199 acres correlated in 10 surveys in Wisconsin. No moderately well drained acres have been correlated. Therefore, this revision redefines this series as well drained only. Also, based on lab data from three Hochheim pedon and from four pedons of a related series (Theresa) in the same till, the concept of the till is changed to densic material (2Cd).\nLaboratory data is available from four pedons. The data shows a cation-exchange activity class of active in two pedons and superactive in the others. The data also shows a dry bulk density of 1.8 to 2.0 in the C horizon within depths of 102 cm (40 inches) for three pedons. Lab data is needed from additional pedons to verify cation-exchange activity class.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon - 0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches) (Ap)\nargillic horizon - 18 to 41 cm (7 to 16 inches) (2Bt1, 2Bt2)\nmoisture regime - mesic\ntemperature regime - udic.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData is available from National Soil Survey Laboratory at Lincoln, Nebraska, for pedon numbers S68WI-015-001,  S68WI-015-002, S09WI131001 and S10WI015001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
