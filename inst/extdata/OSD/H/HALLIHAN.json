The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from about June to November (5 months).  The bulk density of the fine earth fraction is 0.85 to 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 15 percent are cobbles and stones and 35 to 45 percent are gravel.  The fragments are mainly rhyolite.  It has 7 to 18 percent clay.  The very fine sand fraction contains 50 to 70 percent glass.  It is moderately to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 when moist and 4 or 5 when dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 when moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 when moist and 6 or 7 when dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 when moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 7 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent of which 0 to 15 percent are cobbles and stones and 35 to 50 percent are gravel.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 to 6 when moist and 6 to 8 when dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 when moist and dry.  It is sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 50 to 85 percent of which 10 to 25 percent are cobbles and stones and 40 to 60 percent are gravel."
