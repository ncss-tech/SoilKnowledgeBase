  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The umbric epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.  Thickness of the loamy B horizon ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to hard rock is greater than 6 feet. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout unless the surface layer has been limed.  Coarse angular gneiss granite and arkose fragments of gravel to stone size range from 5 to 30 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam or their gravelly or stony equivalents.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam or their stony or gravelly equivalent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or\ntheir stony equivalents.  The Bw horizon often overlies a buried horizon or a stony C horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Odas series is the only other known series in this family.  Brookshire, Burton, Jeffrey, Porters, Rosman, Spivey, Summers, Toxaway, Transylvania, and Tusquitee series are in closely related families.  Brookshire, Porters, and Tusquitee soils have an umbric epipedon less than 10 inches thick.  Burton soils have an umbric epipedon less than 20 inches thick and mean annual temperature less than 47 degrees.  Jeffrey soils have an umbric epipedon less than 10 inches thick and bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Odas soils are poorly drained and have developed in glacial and volcanic outwash materials.  Rosman soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and stratified C horizons.  Spivey and Summers soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section and have an umbric epipedon that is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Toxaway soils are poorly drained.  Transylvania soils are in flood plains and have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Haywood soils are in high coves and on toe slopes that range from 2 to 45 percent at elevations generally above 4000 feet.  They are adjacent to steep stony and rocky soils that are on the uplands.  Haywood soils formed in colluvium from granite, gneiss, and arkose sandstone.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 63 inches near the type location."
