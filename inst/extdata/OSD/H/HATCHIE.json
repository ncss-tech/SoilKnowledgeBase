  "STATES": "AR,TN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hatchie series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on low stream terraces in the Coastal Plain region.  The soil formed in a mantle of loess over loamy alluvium.  The soil has a fragipan in the lower subsoil.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Few to common dark manganese and iron concretions are present in most pedons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon, or Bw horizon, where present has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles in shades of gray or brown range from few to many.  Texture is silt loam or rarely, silty clay loam.\nThe E material has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Commonly there are mottles in shades of yellow or brown.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btx or 2Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6 with common to many mottles in shades of gray, yellow or brown. In many pedons, the 2Btx horizon has no dominant matrix color.

Bude, Calloway, Necessity and Olivier soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Calloway soils have less than 10 percent sand in the control section.  Freeland soils do not have mottles of chroma 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon or within 16 inches of the soil surface.  Taft soils have less than 35 percent base saturation."
