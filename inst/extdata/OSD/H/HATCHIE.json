  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum exceeds 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from about 18 to 32 inches. Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid except where lime has been added.  Content of sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section is more than 15 percent. Few to common dark manganese and iron concretions are present in most pedons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon, or Bw horizon, where present has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles in shades of gray or brown range from few to many.  Texture is silt loam or rarely, silty clay loam.\nThe E material has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Commonly there are mottles in shades of yellow or brown.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btx or 2Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6 with common to many mottles in shades of gray, yellow or brown. In many pedons, the 2Btx horizon has no dominant matrix color.   Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon, if present, has colors similar to those given for the Btx horizon. Texture is loam, clay loam, or silt loam."

Fluker and Woodmont soils have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section; and in addition Woodmont soils formed in loess over limestone, and do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipan.  Bude, Calloway, Necessity and Olivier soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Calloway soils have less than 10 percent sand in the control section.  Freeland soils do not have mottles of chroma 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon or within 16 inches of the soil surface.  Taft soils have less than 35 percent base saturation."
