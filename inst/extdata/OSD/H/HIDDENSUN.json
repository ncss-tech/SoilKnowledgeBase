  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hiddensun series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from volcanic rocks influenced by calcareous loess. Hiddensun soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
