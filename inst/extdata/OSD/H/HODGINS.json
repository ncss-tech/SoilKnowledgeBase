Visible segregations of lime comprise less than 5 percent of any horizon having its upper boundary within 40 inches of the surface. Clay content of the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 30 to 50 percent.  Noncarbonate clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent.  Calcium carbonate content of the control section is 15 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay."

Alama soils have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate in the control section.  Riveroad soils do not have Bk horizons. Copita soils have fine-loamy control sections and have mean annual soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F.  Hoban, Midessa, and Reagan soils have calcic horizons within 40 inches of the surface. Model soils have mean annual temperatures of less than 59 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are in broad, nearly level to very gently sloping filled valleys, outwash plains, or basins.  Slopes are plane and gradients are generally less than 1 percent, but range up to 3 percent. The parent material is of moderately fine and fine textured, calcareous sediments from limestone or from a variety of sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Climate is semiarid to arid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 18 inches and mean annual temperatures range from 60 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 210 to 240 and elevation ranges from 1,500 to 4,000 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 14 to 25."

Monahans soils have less than 0.5 percent organic carbon in the upper 15 inches and are dry for longer periods.  Sanderson soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the 10- to 40-inch control section."
