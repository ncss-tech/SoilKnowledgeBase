  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Honuapo soils are on south and east mid elevation mountain slopes on the slightly dissected upland of Mauna Loa Volcano at elevations from 366 to 1,220 meters (1200 to 4000 feet). The soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to gently sloping pahoehoe lava flows that are about 3,000 to 10,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 0 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,524 to 3,810 millimeters (60 to 150 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 640 to 1,270 meters (25 to 50 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 15 to 20 degrees C. (59 to 68 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
