Slope gradients commonly are less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash sediments. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2  to 12.2  degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1,016 mm (30 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and the elevation ranges from 122 to 427 meters (400 to 1,400 feet) above mean sea level."

The excessively drained Chelsea and Sparta soils, the well drained and somewhat excessively drained Dickinson soils, and well drained Onarga soils are on higher lying areas on outwash plains and stream terraces. The Dickinson soils and the very poorly drained Gilford soils are in a hydrosequence with the Hoopeston soils. Gilford soils are on lower positions on the landform. The somewhat poorly Watseka soils are on similar parts of outwash plains or stream terraces nearby and average more than 75 percent sand in the particle-size control section."

The potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high (14.11 to 42.34 micrometers per second) in the solum and high or very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the substratum. Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and rapid in the underlying material. Very rarely flooded or rarely flooded phases of these soils that occur on stream terraces are recognized."
