  "OVERVIEW": "The Huckleberry series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from phyllite, siltite, argillite, and quartzite with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash. These soils are on mountain slopes and ridge tops. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1,325 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",

Revised from Medial over loamy-skeletal, mixed Entic Cryandepts to Ashy over loamy-skeletal, mixed Typic Vitricryands.\nRevised 1/2002 from Ashy over loamy-skeletal, mixed Typic Vitricryands to Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands.\nRevised 11/2015 from Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands to Medial over loamy skeletal, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands.\nAdditional Information:\nThe type location was moved to the present location in Stevens County. This pedon better reflects the modal concept; determined by MLRA 43A investigations in Soil Survey areas of Kootenai County, Idaho (ID606) and Stevens County, WA (WA065)."
