The natural vegetation is mainly subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce, western larch, and Douglas-fir. The understory is mainly myrtle pachystima, oneleaf foamflower, longtube twinflower, darkwoods violet, and big huckleberry. In northern Idaho, the overstory includes mountain hemlock and the understory includes queencup beadlily, common beargrass, and fool's huckleberry."

Revised from Medial over loamy-skeletal, mixed Entic Cryandepts to Ashy over loamy-skeletal, mixed Typic Vitricryands.\nRevised 1/2002 from Ashy over loamy-skeletal, mixed Typic Vitricryands to Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands.\nRevised 11/2015 from Ashy over loamy-skeletal, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands to Medial over loamy skeletal, amorphic over isotic Typic Vitricryands.\nAdditional Information:\nThe type location was moved to the present location in Stevens County. This pedon better reflects the modal concept; determined by MLRA 43A investigations in Soil Survey areas of Kootenai County, Idaho (ID606) and Stevens County, WA (WA065).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
