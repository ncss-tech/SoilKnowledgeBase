The particle-size control section is the zone from 1 to 30 inches.\nThis series also meets the saturation requirements for oxyaquic subgroup and the aluminum requirements for alic subgroup.  All depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.  Andic soil properties ranges are extrapolated from the associated Sawpeak series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
