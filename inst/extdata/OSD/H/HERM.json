  "OVERVIEW": "The Herm series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived principally from interbedded sandstone and shale and in some pedons have eolian influence in the upper layers.  Herm soils are on mountain slopes, hillslopes, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",
