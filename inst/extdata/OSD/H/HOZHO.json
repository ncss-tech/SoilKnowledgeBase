    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hozho soils are on backslopes of escarpments below mesas and cuestas. They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from Jurassic sandstones. Slopes are 40 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,500 to 8,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with about one half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
