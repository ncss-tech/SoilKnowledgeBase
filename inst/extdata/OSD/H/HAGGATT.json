Beasley, Eden, Enott, Heverlo and Solway soils have a paralithic contact in the series control section. Caneyville, Faywood, Fredonia and Milton soils have lithic contact above 102 cm (40 inches). Bledsoe, Bonnell, Cosperville, Kewaunee, Markland, Mountpleasant, Muncie and Vandalia soils either do not have lithic contact or have a lithic contact above a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Bucklick soils average less than 45 percent clay in the series control section. Estate soils have more than 12 percent sand and 10 percent rock fragment in the A horizon. Lowell soils do not have any part of the argillic horizon that has a hue redder than 7.5YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Haggatt soils are commonly on summits, shoulders and back slopes of hills and sinkholes underlain with limestone. Slopes are typically from 6 to 25 percent, but range from 2 to 25 percent. They formed in clayey residuum that can be capped with up to 51 cm (20 inches) of loess. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degree F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 117 cm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 114 to 311 meters (375 to 1020 feet)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Data on the family particle-size classification of this series shows both fine and fine-silty over clayey. This series is tentatively placed in the fine family. The series has been correlated in Indiana as the Hagerstown series with a lithic contact between 102 to 152 cm (40 and 60 inches). The permeability of these soils is being revised from moderate to moderately slow. Saturated hydraulic conductivity data was collected by Ammozemeter, and permeability was shown to be slower than moderate.\nRepresentative component and horizon data is in DMU# 153539 (Ksat value subject to change.).\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 inches), (Ap horizon); 2) Argillic horizon: the zone from approximately 13 to 112 cm (5 to 44 inches), (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4 horizons); and 3) Lithic contact at 112 cm (44 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data available from Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University S79IN175-6, and data available from the National Soil Survey Lab, S92IN-119-25 and S97IN-043-006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
