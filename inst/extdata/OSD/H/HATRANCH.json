  "OVERVIEW": "The Hatranch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments.  The Hatranch soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
