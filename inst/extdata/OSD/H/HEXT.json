    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of the soil to a paralithic contact with weakly consolidated sandstone, siltstone, lime cemented conglomerate or cemented sandy marine marl ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section ranges from 8 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Horizons with moist values and chroma of less than 3.5 have less than 1 percent organic matter. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bk horizon is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Total clay content ranges from 10 to about 25 percent.  Silicate clay content ranges from 8 to 18 percent.  In some pedons the Bk horizon extends to the paralithic contact.\nThe BCk, is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  The upper 1 or 2 inches of the horizon is weakly to strongly cemented in some pedons.\nThe Cr horizon ranges from weakly consolidated sandstone or siltstone to strongly cemented calcareous sandstone conglomerate or sandy marl."
