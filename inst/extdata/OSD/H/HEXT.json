The soil is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section ranges from 8 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Horizons with moist values and chroma of less than 3.5 have less than 1 percent organic matter. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bk horizon is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Total clay content ranges from 10 to about 25 percent.  Silicate clay content ranges from 8 to 18 percent.  In some pedons the Bk horizon extends to the paralithic contact.\nThe BCk, is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  The upper 1 or 2 inches of the horizon is weakly to strongly cemented in some pedons.\nThe Cr horizon ranges from weakly consolidated sandstone or siltstone to strongly cemented calcareous sandstone conglomerate or sandy marl."
