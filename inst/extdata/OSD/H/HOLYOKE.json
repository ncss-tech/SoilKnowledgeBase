  "STATES": "CT,MA,NJ,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Holyoke series consists of shallow, well drained and somewhat excessively drained soils formed in a thin mantle of till derived mainly from basalt and red sandstone, conglomerate, and shale.  They are nearly level to very steep soils on bedrock controlled ridges and hills.  Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to very high. Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 25 to 50 cm.  Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is abou0 1092 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 25 to 50 cm.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume.  Except where the surface is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded and angular gravel.  Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe O horizon, where present,  has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture ranges from slightly decomposed plant material to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is commonly weak but the range includes moderate, granular or subangular blocky, or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin BC or C horizon with properties similar to the B horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Holyoke soils are nearly level to very steep and are on bedrock controlled hills, modified by glacial action.  Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in a thin mantle of glacial till over bedrock. Some pedons have been modified by silty windblown deposits.  The underlying bedrock is primarily basalt but includes red sandstone, conglomerate, or shale.  Rock outcrops range from few to many.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C, mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1270 mm, and the growing season ranges from 135 to 195 days."

All except Yalesville are very deep to bedrock.  Boonton, Broadbrook, Cheshire, Narragansett, and Wethersfield soils are well drained associates.  Branford, Enfield, Hartford, and Manchester soils are on outwash terraces and are underlain by stratified sand and gravel.  The Haledon soils are somewhat poorly drained and Ludlow and Watchaug soils are moderately well drained.  Very poorly drained Menlo soils and poorly drained Wilbraham soils are in drainageways and low-lying areas."
