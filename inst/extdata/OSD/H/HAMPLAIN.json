  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 48 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the surface layer and subsoil, and from 0 to 15 percent in the substratum. Some pedons have stratified layers below 40 inches with subhorizons having up to 50 percent gravel and cobbles. Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid throughout the soil.\nThe Ap or A horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Dry value is 6 or 7. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, or very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon with hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Structure is granular, platy, or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is subangular blocky or it is massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe C or 2C horizons are massive or single grain with colors similar to the B horizons. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from silt loam to loamy very fine sand which is stratified in some pedons. Consistence ranges from loose through friable."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Barbour, Comus, Deposit, Fryeburg, Hadley, Linden, Occum, Otego, Pope, Trestle, and Wenonah series are similar soils in related families.  Barbour soils have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle size control section. Fryeburg soils are frigid. Comus, Linden, Occum, Pope, and Wenonah soils are coarse-loamy.  Hadley soils lack a cambic horizon.  Otego soils have low chroma mottles within 24 inches.  Deposit and Trestle soils have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hamplain soils are on floodplains near glacial till plateaus and glacial outwash terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils developed in post-glacial alluvium derived mainly from regolith containing sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches, and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 105 to 170 days. Elevation ranges from 700 to 1400 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Hamplain soils are the well drained member of a drainage sequence which includes the moderately well drained Otego soils, the somewhat poorly drained Wakeville soils, and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Wayland soils. Well drained and somewhat excessively drained Chenango and Tunkhannock soils are on nearby glacial outwash terraces. Unadilla and Scio soils are on adjacent higher lacustrine or old alluvial terraces and plains. Trestle soils are on adjacent floodplains that are gravelly in the subsoil and substratum.  Bath, Mardin, and Valois soils are on nearby glacial till uplands."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cleared and are used for growing corn for silage, small grains, hay, and pasture. A few areas have reverted to woodland or brush. Native vegetation is sugar maple and willows. Brushy areas often contain dogwoods, willows, spirea, Hawthorne (thorn apple), and poplar."
