  "OVERVIEW": "The Halfcircle series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced colluvium over residuum weathered from calcareous siltstone on mountain slopes.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Halfcircle soils have slopes of 35 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 21 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
