(Colors are for moist soil.)\nAp--0 to 8 inches; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4) sandy loam; weak coarse granular structure; very friable; many fine roots; 5 percent gravel; strongly acid; clear smooth boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 30 inches.  Rock fragments, mainly rounded gravel, range from 5 to 30 percent by volume in the solum and from 10 to 65 percent in individual layers of the substratum.  The weighted average volume of rock fragments in the particle-size control section is less than 35 percent. Unless limed, the soil ranges from very strongly acid\nto moderately acid throughout.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 tothrough 4.\nUndisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to\n3.  The Ap or A horizon is sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.\nTexture in the upper subhorizon is sandy loam.  The subhorizon has weak granular or subangular blocky structure, or it is massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable. Texture in the lower part of the Bw subhorizons is sandy loam or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.  The subhorizon has weak granular or subangular blocky structure or it is massive or single grain.  Consistence is very friable or loose. Texture of sandy loam in the Bw horizon does not extend below a depth of 28 inches.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 3 to 6. The horizon is commonly stratified sand and gravel.  Texture of individual layers ranges from coarse sand and sand to loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Knickerbocker and Merrimac series. Knickerbocker soils are 7.5YR or yellower in the B and 2C horizons and contain more than 35 percent rock fragments in the 2C horizon. Merrimac soils are 7.5YR or yellower in the B and 2C horizons and generally contain more rock fragments in the solum and more than 30 percent rock fragments in the 2C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Hartford soils are nearly level to strongly sloping and are\non terraces and outwash plains. Slope commonly is 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial materials derived mainly from red sedimentary rocks and basalt. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 50 inches, and the growing season ranges from 140 to 185 days."

Bash soils are somewhat poorly drained soils on floodplains.  Berlin soils are fine-textured soils on glacial lacustrine terraces.  Cheshire, Holyoke, Ludlow, Menlo, Watchaug, Wethersfield, Wilbraham, and Yalesville soils are on nearby glacial till uplands.  Ellington soils are moderately well drained terrace associates. Raypol, Raynham, and Walpole soils are poorly drained and are in low areas."
