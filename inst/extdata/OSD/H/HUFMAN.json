  "OVERVIEW": "The Hufman series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in fibrous peat over loamy alluvium.  Hufman soils are in cutoff meanders and depressions on stream terraces and palsas.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
