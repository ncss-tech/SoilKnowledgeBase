    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness usually ranges from 15 to 22 inches with some extending to 36 inches or as thin as 11 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil is usually dry and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days.\nThe A1 horizon is very pale brown or light yellowish brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4, 6/4).  Moist colors are pale brown, light yellowish brown or yellowish brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4, 5/4).  The thin A1 horizon has been modified by wind.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is typically slightly effervescent or moderately effervescent but is noneffervescent in some pedons.\nA thin (1/8 to 1 inch) vesicular A2 horizon caps the natric horizon of some pedons.  It is light gray or very pale brown (10YR 7/2, 7/3, 8/3).  Moist colors are pale brown or brown (10YR 6/3, 5/3).  Textures are loamy fine sand, sand, or sandy loam.  Structure is weak very thin to medium platy.\nThe B2t horizon is reddish brown, yellowish red, light brown or brown (5YR 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4).   In some pedons it is red (2.5YR 5/6).  Moist colors are reddish brown, yellowish red, red, or dark brown (5YR 4/4, 4/6; 2.5YR 4/6; 7.5YR 4/4).  This horizon is sandy loam or heavy sandy loam and averages 10 to 18 percent clay.  It has strong fine or medium prismatic or columnar structure.  It is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline with pH ranging from 8.8 to 9.2 (Thymol Blue) and is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent with disseminated and segregated lime.  Segregated lime consists of few to common, fine and medium soft masses, filaments and threads.  The electrical conductivity is 4 to 45 mmhos/cm2 and exchangeable sodium exceeds 15 percent.  Most pedons have an exchangeable sodium percentage of 44 to 70 percent.\nThe B3t horizon is yellowish red, light reddish brown, reddish yellow, pink, reddish yellow, light  brown, or light yellowish brown (5YR 5/6, 6/3, 6/8; 7.5YR 7/4, 6/6, 6/4; 10YR 6/4).  Moist colors are brown, strong brown, yellowish brown, yellowish red or reddish brown (7.5YR 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 5/4; 5YR 5/8, 4/6, 4/3).  This horizon is sandy loam or heavy sandy loam.  It has weak to strong, fine to medium angular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is generally strongly alkaline but is very strongly alkaline in some pedons.  It is strongly to violently effervescent with disseminated lime.  Lime is segregated as soft masses, filaments, and threads. Many pedons have fine gypsum crystals present that often appear like soft masses or concretions (1/4 to 3/8 inch).\nThe C horizon is brown, yellowish brown, light yellowish brown, very pale brown, yellow or reddish yellow (10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/47/3, 7/4, 7/6, 8/3, 8/4, 8/8; 7.5YR 6/6., 7/8).  Moist colors are brown, yellowish brown, brownish yellow, light yellowish brown, Pale brown, very pale brown or strong brown (10YR 4/3, 5/6, 5/4, 5/3, 6/6, 6/4, 6/3, 7/3; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8).   This horizon ranges from sand to sandy loam with many profiles containing alternating, often discontinuous strata of sandy loam and coarser textured material.  A few pedons are coarse textured beneath the Bt horizon to depths of 60 inches or more.  Yellow and reddish yellow mottles range from few to common, fine to medium, faint to distinct in most pedons in the lower parts of the C horizon.  Some fine gypsum crystals usually occur.  The reaction is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  The sandy strata are generally noncalcareous and the finer textured strata range from slightly effervescent to moderately effervescent with disseminated lime and segregated lime as filaments, threads and soft masses."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Halloran soils occupy level and minor depressional areas on old high alluvial river terraces and have gradients of 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in old alluvium of mixed origin, although granitic material makes up a considerable part.  They have been overblown with irregularly spaced hummocks and small dunes which occupy 15 to 35 percent of the area and are mapped in some areas as a complex with Dune land.  Elevations are 1,800 to 1,850 feet.  the climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches occurring as rain in late autumn and winter.  Some moisture falls occasionally as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F.  The frost free season is 190 to 255 days."
