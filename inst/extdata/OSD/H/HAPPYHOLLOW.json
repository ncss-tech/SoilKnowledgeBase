  "OVERVIEW": "The Happyhollow series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in clayey glacial till and/or clayey lacustrine deposits modified by wave action sediments and in the underlying over loamy and/or sandy stratified lacustrine deposits. They are on till plains and/oron lake plains and depressional areas.  Permeability is slow in the clayey material and moderate to rapid in the stratified substratum lacustrine deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 23 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Reaction in the upper part of the solum ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline, and in the lower part of the solum ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  The substratum is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 9 to 23 inches.  The weighted average clay content at 10 to 40 inches ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Total rock fragment content is less than 2 percent throughout the profile.  Redox features, saturation and aquic conditions occur within 10 inches of the surface at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Some pedons have a thin (1 to 4 inch) muck layer in the surface.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nA thin Eg horizon may be present in some pedons.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma 1 or 2.  It is clay, silty clay loam or clay loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon, with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 4 or 5.  It is clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4.  It is clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 and chroma of 3.  It typically has stratified textures of silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy  fine sand, very fine sand or fine sand, but includes thin lamellae of clay loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a 2Ck horizon with colors and textures similar to those of the 2C horizon."

The well drained Cornucopia, moderately well drained Portwing, and somewhat poorly drained Herbster soils are in a drainage catena with Happyhollow soils.  The poorly drained Pickford and somewhat poorly drained Badriver soils are on similar landscapes where the clay is thicker than 60 inches.  The somewhat poorly drained Allendale and poorly drained Wakeley series occur on similar landscapes but have 20 to 40 inches of 20 to 40 inches of sandy outwash deposits above the clay and lack the silty and sandy substratum."

Happyhollow soils have a perched seasonal water table above the clayey till that ranges from 1 foot above the surface to 1 foot below the surface at some time during the period from September to June in normal years.  Happyhollow soils also have at +1 to -1 foot in the clayey deposits and an apparent water table below 40 inches in the stratified substratumsilty and sandy depositsat some time during the same time period in normal years."

Water table studies in this soil (and it's associated soils) were used to classify this series."
