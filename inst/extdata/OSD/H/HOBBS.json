  "OVERVIEW": "The Hobbs series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified, silty alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, foot slopes, and alluvial fans in river valleys of Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 640 millimeters (25 inches) at the type location.",
