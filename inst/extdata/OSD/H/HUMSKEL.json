  "OVERVIEW": "The Humskel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium from argillite or quartzite.  Humskel soils are on glacially modified mountain ridges and side slopes with slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
