They formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from hard argillite or quartzite.  The average annual precipitation is 85 to 110 inches.  The mean July temperature is about 53 degrees F., and the mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 37 to 39 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
