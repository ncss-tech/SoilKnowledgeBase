Soil reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bhir horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam with 30 to 45 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bir horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.

They formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from hard argillite or quartzite.  The average annual precipitation is 85 to 110 inches.  The mean July temperature is about 53 degrees F., and the mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 37 to 39 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
