  "OVERVIEW": "The Harmon series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in thin layers of fractured dolomite limestone over shale and siltstone of the Blaine formation of Permian age.  These soils are on very gently sloping to moderately sloping uplands in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78).  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 6 to 18 inches.  The solum averages 35 to 65 percent coarse fragments, consisting mainly of dolomite but also contains claystone, siltstone, and gypsum parafragments in some pedons.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section ranges from 40 to more than 80 percent in the less-than-20 mm soil fraction.  Reaction is moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam.  Effervescence ranges from slight to violent and visible carbonates range from few to many.\nThe ACk horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam.  Effervescence is typically violent and visible carbonates range from common to many.\nThe Cr1 horizon, where present, consists of partially weathered, fractured gray dolomitic limestone.  Space of fractures ranges from 4 to 10 inches or more.\nThe Cr2 horizon consists of interbedded claystone and siltstone in shades of gray, brown, and red."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Eddy series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Cottonwood, Doss, Ector, Lueders, Pidcoke, and Talpa series.  Eddy soils are in a slightly warmer and wetter climate and formed in Cretaceous age chalk.  Cottonwood soils are very shallow over gypsum and contain less than 10 percent coarse fragments.  Doss soils have a mollic epipedon.  Ector, Lueders, Pidcoke, and Talpa soils have a mollic epipedon and a lithic contact."

These soils formed in dolomite limestone layers that are interbedded with claystone, siltstone, and gypsum.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230 days.  Elevation ranges from 1400 to 2100 feet.  The Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 32 to 40."

Aspermont, La Casa, and Nipsum soils are deep or very deep to Permian age redbed sediments and are on lower landscape positions.  Cottonwood soils are very shallow to gypsum and are on similar landscape positions.  Talpa soils are on similar landscape positions, have a mollic epipedon and a lithic contact.  Sinkholes are also a common feature of the karst topography."

Native range vegetation consists mainly of sideoats grama, little bluestem, silver bluestem, buffalograss, slim tridens, threeawn, fall witchgrass, with various prennial forbs.  Mesquite and cactus invade these areas if not controlled."
