  "OVERVIEW": "The Hatton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loess and silty pedisediments that are underlain by weathered glacial till. These soils are on narrow rounded ridgetops and have slopes of 2 to 9 percent. Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",
