    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic is 30 to more than 60 inches and the solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches. Depth to horizons that have fragic characteristics ranges from 27 to 38 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR; value of 3 or 4, 5 or 6 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3. The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR; value of 4 or 5, 6 or 7 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam. The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt or silt loam. Reaction of the A and E horizons is commonly strongly acid or moderately acid and ranges to neutral where limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silty clay loam or silty clay and the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon average between 35 and 48 percent clay, but some subhorizons range up to as much as 55 percent. The Bt horizon is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid. Some pedons have E' horizons above the 2Btx horizons. Expression of the brittleness and consistence of the fragic horizons range from moderate to weak.\nThe 2B't horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6 and redox features with chroma of 2 or less. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to about 5 percent and sand content ranges from about 10 to 20 percent of fine sand or coarser."
