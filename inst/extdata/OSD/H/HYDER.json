  "OVERVIEW": "The Hyder series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from rhyolite and related volcanic rocks.  Hyder soils are on mountains and hills and have slopes of 1 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 72 degrees F.",

Appleseed, Goldroad, Redneedle, and Sunrock soils are moist for less than 20 days cumulative in the summer. In addition, Appleseed soils formed in parent material derived from limestone, Goldroad soils formed in parent material derived from granite and are dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter gravel, Redneedle soils formed in parent material derived from sandstone, and Sunrock soils formed in parent material derived from andesite and similar volcanic rocks. Quilotosa soils have control sections dominated by coarse and very coarse sand, have layers of weathered bedrock and formed on granitic and metamorphic rock."
