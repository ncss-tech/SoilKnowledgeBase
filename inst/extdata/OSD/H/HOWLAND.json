  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the dense lodgment till ranges from 50 to 84 cm (20 to 33 in).  Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm (60 in).  The weighted average of clay in the particle-size control section is less than 10 percent.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction in the mineral solum and substratum is silt loam or loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent throughout the mineral soil with the majority being pebble size.  Stones and boulders cover 0 to 15 percent of the surface.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum and very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nSome areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3 or, an A horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They have weak or moderate, fine granular structure and consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak very fine granular or weak very thin or thin platy structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  B horizons have weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular or weak very fine or fine subangular blocky structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Redoximorphic features are in some part of the horizon.  The BC horizon has weak fine granular or subangular blocky or weak to strong, thin or medium platy structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak to strong medium or thick platy or weak coarse and/or very coarse prismatic structure or the horizon is massive.  All structure in the Cd horizon is considered inherited from the parent material.  Consistence is firm or very firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chesuncook, Crary, Dixmont, Peru, Ragmuff, Skerry, Sunapee, and Worden series.  Chesuncook soils have more than 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Crary soils have a thin aeolian or water deposited mantle.  Peru soils have dense substratum layers with loose or friable segregated sand lenses with a horizontal orientation that are layered within a loamy matrix constitute 0 to 20 percent of the fabric of the till. The lenses are commonly of coarse, medium and fine sand ranging from less than a cm to 3 cm (1/8 inch to 1 in) in thickness. Skerry soils have dense substraum layers that are typically loamy sand or loamy fine sand or loam with sandy lenses comprising more than 20 percent of the layer. Sunapee soils have a friable substratum. Ragmuff soils have a lithic contact within 152 cm.   Worden soils have a spodic horizon greater than 46 cm (18 in) thick or a Bh horizon greater than 10 cm (4 in) thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Howland soils are on drumlins and till ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent but commonly is less than 15 percent.  The soils formed in dense till derived mainly from phyllite, slate, metasandstone and some granite.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C (38 to 44 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1168 mm (36 to 46 in).  The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 91 to 670 m (300 to 2200 ft) above mean sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Previous revision reflected a change in classification to coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Aquic Haplorthods to conform with Keys to Soil Taxonomy, sixth edition, 1994.  Some soils formerly mapped as the Howland series will be included with the Telos or Colonel series.  3.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Albic horizon - the zone from 3 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in) (E horizon).\n2. Spodic horizon - the zone from 5 to 32 cm (2 to 13 in) (Bh and Bs1 horizons).\nc. Aquic feature-  redoximorphic features within 76 cm (30 in) of the mineral soil surface.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics is Technical Bulletin 46, Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, March 1971.\nArchived Soil Interpretation Record numbers for the Howland series were: Howland, ME0005; and Howland, stony, ME0006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
