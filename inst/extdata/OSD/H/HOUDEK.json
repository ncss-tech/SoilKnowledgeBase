  "OVERVIEW": "The Houdek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till on uplands.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches and includes all or part of the Bt horizon.  The soil contains 0 to 10 percent by volume of coarse fragments as pebbles.  Some pedons contain up to 20 percent by volume of stones throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam or silt loam but is clay loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam averaging between 27 and 35 percent clay.  Some pedons have thin horizons that exceed 35 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam and is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It contains few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.

Glenham soils have thinner sola, have free carbonates at shallower depths, and are slightly drier. Gosper soils formed in sandy alluvium and are moderately well drained. Ree soils formed in loamy alluvium and typically have a stratified substrata.  Reventon soils have carbonates above a depth of 14 inches and receive less rainfall.  Wewela soils have shale bedrock between depths of 22 and 30 inches. Wineg soils have calcic horizons."

Surfaces are plane or convex, and slope gradients typically are less than 6 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in friable, calcareous loam or clay loam glacial till.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 26 inches."

Clarno soils have argillic horizons and are on similar upland positions.  Prosper soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and are in upland swales and shallow drainageways.  Betts soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on ridgetops and more steeply sloping adjacent uplands.  Ethan soils contain carbonates within depths of 10 inches, do not have an argillic horizon, and are on convex upper slopes in the landscape.  Dudley and Stickney soils have a natric horizon and usually are on nearly level areas with microrelief.  Tetonka soils have an A2 horizon, are fine textured and are in depressions and drainageways."
