  "STATES": "MD,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Hoadly series are very deep, moderately well drained to somewhat poorly drained, with slow permeability.  They formed partly in colluvium from adjacent higher lying soils and partly in residuum from granite gneiss and schist of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes commonly range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from about 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to fragipan layer ranges from 15 to 34 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet.  Rock fragments of angular and subrounded quartz gravel range from 1 to 15 percent with higher concentrations commonly at the lithologic discontinuity.  Flakes of mica are few in the upper B horizon and range to many in the 2B and C horizons.  The soil is very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe A or AP horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y value of 2 through 5 and chroma of 2 or 4.  It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The E horizon is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  Mottling with chroma of 2 or less is in the upper 10 inches.  It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  The 2Bx horizon is commonly mottled in shades of brown, yellow and gray, sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.  It ranges from 6 to 30 inches thick and is firm platy and brittle.  Stone lines from 2 to 6 inches thick range from 2 to 30 percent of angular and subrounded quartz gravel.\nThe 2B horizon is commonly mottled in shades of yellow, brown, and gray sandy clay, sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam or clay.  Some pedons do not have a 2B horizon.\nThe 2C horizon is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, and gray loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  It is saprolite from weathered granite, granite gneiss or schist."
