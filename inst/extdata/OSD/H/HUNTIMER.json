  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates typically is from 14 to 20 inches and ranges from 14 to 30 inches.  The control section averages between 35 and 50 percent clay and contains less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Maximum clay content is in the A horizon or in the upper part of the B horizon and decreases with depth.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick and extends into the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silty clay loam, but in some pedons it is silty clay.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Typically, dark colored tongues of A horizon extend into the Bw horizon to depths of 20 to 36 inches.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically has few to many, distinct or prominent mottles.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam.  It has few to many accumulation of carbonate.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It has few to many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonates.  It typically is silty clay loam or silt loam, but some pedons contain thin strata of sandy material.  Stratified silt and sand or firm clay loam glacial till is at depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  Some pedons are distinctly laminated.  The C horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Corson soils average more than 50 percent clay in the series control section and have formed in lacustrine or loess deposits on dissected uplands.  Rosehill soils have a paralithic contact with clayey shale at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Sutphen soils receive more precipitation and have a mollic epipedon 24 to 48 inches thick."

The soil formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediment of ice-locked lakes.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 20 to 26 inches."
