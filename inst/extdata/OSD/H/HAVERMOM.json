  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The particle- size control section is stratified but is loam or clay loam when mixed and has 18 to 35 percent clay with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments, mainly rounded pebbles, range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  ESP ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are variable due to stratification but when averaged are loam or clay loam with thin layers of fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, and very fine sandy loam and sandy clay loam.  ESP averages 15 to 30 percent throughout.  EC is 2 to 8 mmhos throughout.  It commonly is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline throughout, but thin layers are moderately alkaline when buffered with salts.  Rock fragments exceed 10 percent below 40 inches in some pedons."
