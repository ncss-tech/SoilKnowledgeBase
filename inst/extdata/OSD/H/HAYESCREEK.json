  "OVERVIEW": "The Hayescreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and zeolite influenced colluvium and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from calcareous rhyolitic bedrock. These soils occur on mountain slopes, hills and escarpments. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
