Depth to secondary calcium carbonate is 28 to 48 inches.\nThe A and B21t horizons range from dark grayish brown to dark\nreddish brown or dark brown in hues of 5YR through 10YR, values of\n3 and 4, and chromas of 2 and 3.  They are sandy clay loam, loam,\nor clay loam that are slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe B22t and B23t horizons are brown or red through strong brown\nin hues of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, values of 3 through 5, and chormas\nof 2 through 6.  Chromas increase with depth.  They are clay or\nsandy clay that are slighlty acid through moderately alkaline.\nClay content in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is 35 to 45 percent.\nThe B24t and B3ca horizons are reddish to brownish and some pedons contain reddish and yellowish mottles.  Hues are 2.5YR through\n7.5YR, values of 4 through 6, and chromas of 2 through 8.  Common\nto many coarse mottles with chromas of more than 4 occur in pedons where the dominant chromas are 4 or less.  They are sandy clay\nloam or sandy clay and contain 5 to 30 percent by volume or\nvisible calcium carbonate.  Some pedons contain a few fragments of sandstone below about 46 inches."
