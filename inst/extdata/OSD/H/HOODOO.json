Elevations range from 1,900 to 2,800 feet. The soils formed in alluvium mainly from volcanic ash. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 38 inches. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."

Bonner, Pend Oreille, Rathdrum, and Treble soils are well drained. Bonner and Rathdrum soils are on on glacial outwash plains and terraces.  Pend Oreille and Treble soils are on mountains and foothills.  Odenson soils are fine-silty in the control section and are on glaciolacustrine terraces.  Pywell soils are very poorly drained organic soils and are in depressional areas of drainageways and floodplains."

Lab data from the Hoodoo modal site in Spokane County, Washington meets Aquandic subgroup criteria and will be considered a taxadjunt to the series.  There is some question as to whether these wet soils high in ash meet andic soil properties.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data  S01-WA063-004, Spokane County, Washington; NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
