  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoodoo Series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium mainly from volcanic ash. Hoodoo soils are in drainageways, on stream terraces, bottomlands and around perimeters of lakes. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
