  "OVERVIEW": "The Hilger series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or till from igneous rock and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, mountains, and moraines. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
