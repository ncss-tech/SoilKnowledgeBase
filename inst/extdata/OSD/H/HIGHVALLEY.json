  "OVERVIEW": "The Highvalley series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in colluvium from basalt and welded tuff mixed with volcanic ash throughout. Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent in mountains. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Kahler soils have vitrandic features to depths of 20 to 40 inches, typically over a lithologic discontinuity (2C horizons), has clay ranging to 35 percent and rock fragments ranging to 35 percent in the particle-size control section. Minam soils have 20 to 30 percent glass in the A horizon and 2C horizons with greater than 35 percent rock fragments within 20 to 30 inches. McGarr soils are 20 ro 40 inches to a lithic contact (basalt).
