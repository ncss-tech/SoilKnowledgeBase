Derr soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to shale bedrock. Hall Ranch soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic contact. Kahler soils have vitrandic features to depths of 20 to 40 inches, typically over a lithologic discontinuity (2C horizons), has clay ranging to 35 percent and rock fragments ranging to 35 percent in the particle-size control section. Minam soils have 20 to 30 percent glass in the A horizon and 2C horizons with greater than 35 percent rock fragments within 20 to 30 inches. McGarr soils are 20 ro 40 inches to a lithic contact (basalt).  Myzel soils are moderately well drained with seasonal high water table at 30 to 48 inches and average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
