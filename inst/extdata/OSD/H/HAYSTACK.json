The mollic epipedon is 7 to 18 inches thick.  The soils are usually dry and are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 120 to 150 days (cumulative).  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 50 to 70 percent coarse fragments, primarily gravel and 15 to 25 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 25 percent.  It contains 0 to 50 percent gravel, cobbles and stones.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly and extremely gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 30 percent.  It contains 35 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 40 to 60 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones.  Total rock fragments range from 60 to 80 percent.  Secondary lime appears as seams and nodules or as coatings on coarse fragments. It is slightly to moderately alkaline throughout.  The upper part is loamy sand or sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay and the lower part is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand with 5 to 10 percent clay."

Heytou soils formed in glacial till, have very stony, extremely stony or extremely cobbly surface layers and are moderately or strongly alkaline is the substratum; in addition depth to carbonates is 20 to 36 inches.  Nighthawk soils contain 5 to 60 percent rock fragments in the soil and average 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section; in addition the solum is 18 to 26 inches thick.  Olex soils have a 12 to 25 inch thick silt loam loess mantle over the skeletal discontinuity.  Pehastin soils have carbonates at 15 to 27 inches.  Redcanyon soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock."
