  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 60 degrees to 66 degrees F.  A layer within 60 inches of the surface and commonly a layer above 40 inches are saturated during some period.  The 10- to 40-inch control section contains less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent rock fragments.  The solum ranges from 0 to 14 inches thick.  The organic matter decreases irregularly with increasing depth above 50 inches.  The entire profile is slightly to moderately calcareous, but no distinct Cca horizon is commonly present.  The profile ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon, when mixed to 7 inches, has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3, 4, or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Organic matter content is 0.5 to 1.5 percent.  When value is 5 dry and 3 moist the thickness is too thin for a mollic epipedon.\nThe C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is stratified fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are common below 30 but above depth of 40 inches.  In some pedons loose sand and/or gravel substratum is below depth of 40 inches."

Falk, Griver, and Job soils have mean annual soil temperature warmer than 47 degrees F.  Hunsaker soils have a medium-textured control section containing more than 18 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Heiseton soils are on bottomlands and low stream terraces at elevations of 4,200 to 5,900 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Many areas are channeled.  The soils formed mainly in moderately coarse textured alluvium, which may overlie sand and gravel or other stratified sediments.  The alluvium is dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources but contains some rhyolitic, basaltic, and granitic material.  The climate is semiarid and has dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 40 degrees to 45 degrees F.  Average frost-free period is 95 to 126 days."

Bannock soils have gravel and sand at a depth of less than 40 inches and have a mollic epipedon.  Blackfoot soils are medium textured and have a mollic epipedon.  Wardboro soils are less than 20 inches deep over sand and gravel."

Naturally subject to flooding during most years, but flooding is now controlled to a considerable degree by dams and dikes.  A fluctuating water table occurs at depths of 4 to 6 feet."

The present natural vegetation is mainly big sagebrush, cheatgrass, rabbitbrush, needleandthread, streambank wheatgrass, and Indian ricegrass.  In places, the vegetation includes cottonwood, skunkbrush, Rocky Mountain redcedar, prickly pear, bluebunch wheatgrass, and sand dropseed."
