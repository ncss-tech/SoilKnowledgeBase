  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Iulus series. The series was separated based on taxonomy and climate. The type location was moved from Harris County to Polk County, Texas during the update of MLRA 152B. The Harris County location was not central to the majority of the map units and was experiencing the influence of urban encroachment.  The classification was changed from entisols to inceptisols due to the presence of a cambic horizon in most pedons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 cm (0 to 3 in) (A horizon)\nCambic horizon- 8 to 203 cm (3 to 80 in) (Bw horizons\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory data pending on pedon S12TX3731025 from the type location in Polk County, Texas and from S2012TX2017130 (lab pedon number 12N8315) from Harris County.  Soil Survey office lab data available on 5 pedons.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
