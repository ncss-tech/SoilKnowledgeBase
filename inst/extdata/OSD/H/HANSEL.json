  "OVERVIEW": "The Hansel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from a mixed variety of rocks.  Hansel soils are on lake terraces and lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil moisture regime is Xeric bordering Aridic.  They are moist for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the winter.\nDepth to the Bk (calcic) horizon is 15 to 32 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 10 to 22 inches.  The average organic matter content is more than 1.0 percent to a depth of 15 inches, generally about 1.5 to 2 percent.  The soil ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon is noncalcareous slightly calcareous.  Value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma 2 to 4.  It is 4 to 15 inches thick.\nThe Bt (argillic) horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y. Value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 25 to 35 percent clay, but dominantly 28 to 32 percent.  This horizon has few to common thin clay films on peds.  It is neutral to strongly alkaline and the lower part is slightly to moderately calcareous; thickness ranges from 8 to 17 inches.\nThe Bk and C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from very fine sandy loam or silt loam to heavy silty clay loam.  This horizon is mildly to very strongly alkaline."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone of clay accumulation from 10 to 18 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone of carbonate increase from 18 to 33 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nIn September 1994 the classification was changed from Xerollic Haplargid to Calcic Haploxeralf.  The series is correlated with upland range sites and is used in map units that are in nonirrigated farmland.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated."
