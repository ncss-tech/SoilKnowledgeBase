  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to fractured and moderately weathered serpentinite rock ranges from 11 to 25 inches.  Depth to hard fractured consolidated volcanic bedrock ranges from 20 to 37 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid in the Oi horizon and ranges from slightly acid to neutral in the A and Bt horizons.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent, by volume.\nThe Oi horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Content of rock fragments range from 2 to less than 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is mucky peat.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Content of rock fragments range from 2 to 30 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 3.  Content of rock fragments range from 2 to 20 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr layer is composed of hard fractured and moderately weathered serpentinite.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanized equipment.\nThe R layer is composed of hard fractured consolidated serpentinite bedrock."

A soil moisture and soil temperature study performed in the San German Area Soil Survey Update recognized the Perudic Soil Moisture Regime in Puerto Rico, recognized the isothermic soil temperature regime at 750 meters above sea level (in Perudic Soil Moisture Regime) and 900 meters above sea level (in Udic Soil Moisture Regime) and adjusted the isothermic-isohyperthermic line.\nHoconuco soils formed in the Serpentinite Formation (Ks).\nHoconuco soils are in MLRA 270.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
