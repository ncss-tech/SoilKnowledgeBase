  "OVERVIEW": "The Highhorn series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived dominantly from argillite, with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Highhorn soils are on mountains with slopes of 12 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. It contains 40 to 60 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate. Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 1.0 percent. It is slightly or moderately smeary. The moist bulk density is 0.85 to 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe 2Bwb horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is very gravelly silty clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly silty clay loam, or extremely gravelly clay loam. Field estimated clay is 27 to 35 percent.
