  "OVERVIEW": "The Huntmount series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material from granitic rocks and from colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Huntmount soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The soils are neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.  The soils are dry in all parts from mid-July to November for about 110 consecutive days and moist in all parts from January to April for about 90 days.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from mid-March to December for about 260 days.\nThe A horizons have dry color of 10YR, 5/2 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, or 5/4.  The moist color of the upper 2 to 4 inches is 10YR 3/2 or 3/3 and the lower part is 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 7.5Y 4/4.  This horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, with cobbly, bouldery modifiers.  Rock fragments consists of 0 to 25 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Boulders and stones occupy 3 to 15 percent.  Clay averages 10 to 18 percent.\nThe Bt horizons have dry color of 7.5YR5/2, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, or 5/4.  It is heavy sandy loam, or loam, with cobbly modifiers.  Rock fragments range up to 35 percent and consist of 0 to 25 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles, stones, or boulders.  Clay averages 18 to 25 percent.\nThe C horizon, transitional to the weathered rock, has variegated dry colors of 5YR 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, and 10YR 6/3.

    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was originally considered an intergrade to an aridic moisture regime.  Future study should evaluate whether this series has an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric and should be reclassified to a Xeric Haplargid.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated."
