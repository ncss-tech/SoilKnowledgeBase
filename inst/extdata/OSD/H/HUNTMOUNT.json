The soils are neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.  The soils are dry in all parts from mid-July to November for about 110 consecutive days and moist in all parts from January to April for about 90 days.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from mid-March to December for about 260 days.\nThe A horizons have dry color of 10YR, 5/2 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, or 5/4.  The moist color of the upper 2 to 4 inches is 10YR 3/2 or 3/3 and the lower part is 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 7.5Y 4/4.  This horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, with cobbly, bouldery modifiers.  Rock fragments consists of 0 to 25 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Boulders and stones occupy 3 to 15 percent.  Clay averages 10 to 18 percent.\nThe Bt horizons have dry color of 7.5YR5/2, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, or 5/4.  It is heavy sandy loam, or loam, with cobbly modifiers.  Rock fragments range up to 35 percent and consist of 0 to 25 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles, stones, or boulders.  Clay averages 18 to 25 percent.\nThe C horizon, transitional to the weathered rock, has variegated dry colors of 5YR 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, and 10YR 6/3.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or loam, with gravelly, cobbly or stony modifiers.  Weathered granitic rock fragments range from 0 to 50 percent and consist of 0 to 20 percent pebbles, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Huntmount soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks and from colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Elevations are 5,000 to 7,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid, with hot, dry summers with infrequent thunder showers of short duration and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is 35 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is 75 degrees F.  The frost free season is 185 to 235 days."

Luckrich soils formed in alluvium, and lack an argillic horizon.  Panamint soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, have a mollic epipedon, and a cambic horizon.  Ulida soils are 1 to 20 inches deep to paralithic contact and have an aridic moisture regime."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was originally considered an intergrade to an aridic moisture regime.  Future study should evaluate whether this series has an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric and should be reclassified to a Xeric Haplargid.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
