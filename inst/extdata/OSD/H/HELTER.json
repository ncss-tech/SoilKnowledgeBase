  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 60 degrees F., without an 0 horizon.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 60 to 70 days during the summer.  Depth to bedrock commonly is 60 inches or more, but ranges from 40 to 60 inches in some areas.  The thickness of the ash over the buried soil ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The thicker deposits are in concave positions and on north-facing slopes.  Krotovinas and disturbance from windthrow are common.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry.  It has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is ashy silt loam and commonly has less than 10 percent clay and less than 25 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It has weak structure or is massive.\nThe 2Bwb horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam and has 0 to 30 percent rock fragments.  The lower part commonly is gravelly or cobbly and is very cobbly in some pedons that are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.  It usually has weak structure, but in some pedons it is massive."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Helter soils are on gently sloping plateaus and steep north-facing slopes at elevations of 3,500 to 6,500 feet. Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  They formed in volcanic ash and some loess over older buried loess and weathered basalt.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 22 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 20 to 60 days."
