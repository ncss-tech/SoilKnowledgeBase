  "OVERVIEW": "The Highfield series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from metabasalt, metarhyolite, metaandesite, greenstone schist, and other light colored rocks.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 80 inches.  Rock fragments of metarhyolite, schist, rhyolite or sandstone range from 5 to 25 percent by volume in the surface horizons, from 15 to 40 percent in subhorizons of the B horizon and from 20 to 80 percent in the C horizons.   Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the solum and strongly acid or moderately acid in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Fine-earth textures  are silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Fine-earth textures  are silt loam or loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 6. Fine-earth textures  are silt loam or loam.  It has fine or medium subangular blocky structure.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 6. Inherited variegated colors are common. Fine earth texture is silt loam or loam."

Chavies and Watertown soils have rounded rock fragments of acid sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  Cranston soils have rock fragments of primarily siltstone.  Lewisberry soils have a B horizon that is 5YR or redder.  Tracy soils formed in glacial outwash and contain a high portion of shale fragments."

The regolith is material weathered form metabasalt, metarhyolite, metaandesite, greenstone schist, and other light colored rocks.  The climate is humid temperate with mean annual temperature of 48 to 56 degrees F., mean annual precipitation of 35 to 48 inches, and a growing season of 150 to 180 days."
