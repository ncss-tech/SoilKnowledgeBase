  "OVERVIEW": "The Holinrock series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed of residuum and colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks.  The Holinrock soils are on ridges and foothills.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 15 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
