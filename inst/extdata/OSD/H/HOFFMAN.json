  "OVERVIEW": "The Hoffman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills and mountains.  These soils formed mainly from granitic rocks.  Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 (200 mm), and the average annual temperature is about 57 to 63 degrees F.(14 to 17 degrees C.)",
