  "OVERVIEW": "The Hakuma series consists of shallow, moderately well drained soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava. Hakuma soils are on the low elevation, windward slopes of Mauna Loa and Kilauea volcanoes. Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. Mean annual rainfall is about 3,900 millimeters (154 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F).",

The soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to hilly pahoehoe lava flows that are 200 to 2,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 10 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava. Mean annual rainfall is 3,000 to 5,000 millimeters (120 to 200 inches) with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 762 to 1,016 millimeters (30 to 40 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 21 to 25 degrees C (70 to 77 degrees F). The mean annual soil temperature is 22 degrees C or higher (71 degrees F)."
