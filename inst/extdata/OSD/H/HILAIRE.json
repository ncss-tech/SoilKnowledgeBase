  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hilaire series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy lacustrine sediments over clayey till or lacustrine sediments primarily on lake plains.  Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the upper mantle, and slow in the underlying clayey sediments.  These soils have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 21 inches.",

The amount of rock fragments by volume ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper sediments (A, Bw and C horizons).  Some pedons have a gravelly layer at the base of the upper sediment.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Strata of fine gravel in the lower part is included in the range.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a C horizon with properties similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe 2Bk, 2BCk, 2CBk and 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Where formed in till the horizons have 2 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Where formed in lacustrine sediments the horizons are free of rock fragments and may be finely stratified or laminated with very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or silty clay loam."

These soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of sandy sediments over clayey till or lacustrine sediments of late Wisconsin age.  Typically these soils are on broad flats or long narrow irregular shaped rises orientated northwest to southeast.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 24 inches.  Frost-free days range from 110 to 135.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 750 to 1250 feet."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 inches; aquic subgroup - low chroma within 40 inches of the surface; contrasting family - texture change at 34 inches.\nHilaire soils in the past were included with the Foldahl series.\nThe classification was changed to the Oxyaquic subgroup even though the morphology of this pedon may meet the Aquic subgroup criteria because it was felt Oxyaquic better fit the water state of the series.  In addition, the somewhat poorly drained phase was eliminated from the range of the series.  A different pedon may need to be selected to represent the series and another series established for the Aquic subgroup and somewhat poorly drained phase.  01/2000."
