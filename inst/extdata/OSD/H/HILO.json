The soils formed in material weathered from volcanic ash underlain by 100 to 300 thousand year old pahoehoe and `a`a lava flows.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent but can be as high as 200 percent in gulch areas.  Mean annual precipitation is 3302 to 5080 mm (130 to over 200 inches).  The mean annual temperature is 22 degrees C or higher (72 degrees F or higher).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
