Depth to slickensides range from 7 to 22 inches.  Untilled soils have a gilgai microrelief.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 in the upper part.  The lower part of the Bkss horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 4, or is mottled in shades of gray, brown, olive, or yellow.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  In some pedons fossils of oysters and other shellfish are common in the Bkss horizon.\nThe C horizon where present has colors in shades of gray, olive, or yellow.  The texture ranges from silty clay loam to clay.  It is moderately alkaline to alkaline."

Beaumont, Eutaw, and Garner soils have color value of 3.5 or more within a depth of 12 inches in more than half of each pedon.  Brooksville, Houston, Keiffer and Okolona soils have color chroma of 1.5 or greater in the A horizon.  In addition, Houston soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section.  Hollywood soils have limestone bedrock.  Burleston, Clarita, Houston Black, Randall, Roscoe, and San Saba soils have cracks that remain open more than 90 cumulative days in most years.   Lake Charles soils have matrix color of less than 1.5 to a depth of 40 inches or more and lack Bkss horizons with soft powdery lime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in clayey, calcareous sediments of Tertiary age.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 66 degrees F, and frost free days range from 275 to 300."
