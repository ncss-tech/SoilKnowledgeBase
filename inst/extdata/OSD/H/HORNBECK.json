The lower part of the Bkss horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 4, or is mottled in shades of gray, brown, olive, or yellow.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  In some pedons fossils of oysters and other shellfish are common in the Bkss horizon.\nThe C horizon where present has colors in shades of gray, olive, or yellow.  The texture ranges from silty clay loam to clay.  It is moderately alkaline to alkaline."

Hollywood soils have limestone bedrock.  Burleston, Clarita, Houston Black, Randall, Roscoe, and San Saba soils have cracks that remain open more than 90 cumulative days in most years.   Lake Charles soils have matrix color of less than 1.5 to a depth of 40 inches or more and lack Bkss horizons with soft powdery lime."
