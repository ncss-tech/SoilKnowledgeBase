Boca soils are on similar positions and are moderately deep to limestone.  Felda soils are on similar to slightly higher positions.  The poorly drained Ft. Green soils are on higher positions.  Isles soils are on similar to lower positions and are deep to limestone bedrock.  The poorly drained Pinellas and Pople soils are on similar to higher positions.  In addition, Pinellas soils are underlain by shell fragments and Pople soils have Calcic horizons."

Natural vegetation consists of cypress, willow, sweetbay, red bay, pickerel weed, arrowhead, maidencane, sawgrass, chalky bluestem, bushybeard bluestem, sand cordgrass, waxmyrtle, and other water tolerant plants.  Some areas have slash pine and scattered cabbage palms."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 15 to 21 inches (Eg horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 21 to 52 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).\nThe water table is above the surface more than 6 months during most years in depressions.  It is within 12 inches of the surface for most of the remainder of the year.   In other landscapes the water table is within 12 inches of the surface for 2 to 4 months during most years.  The water table may recede to as deep as 60 inches during droughty periods.\nHicoria soils were formerly included with the Floridana soils.  Lab data confirms the surface layer as being an umbric epipedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  University of Florida, IFAS, Soil Characterization Lab numbers, 6042 to 6047.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
