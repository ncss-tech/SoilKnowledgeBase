  "REVDATE": "10/2003",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Hicoria series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained, moderately slowly to slowly permeable soils in seasonally ponded depressions and broad low flats.  They formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.",

Some areas have slash pine and scattered cabbage palms."

It is within 12 inches of the surface for most of the remainder of the year.   In other landscapes the water table is within 12 inches of the surface for 2 to 4 months during most years.  The water table may recede to as deep as 60 inches during droughty periods.\nHicoria soils were formerly included with the Floridana soils.  Lab data confirms the surface layer as being an umbric epipedon."
