The Courthouse soils are calcareous throughout and have hues of 5YR or redder. The Graham soils have an argillic horizon and are clayey. Palos Verdes soils have a Bt horizons that are fine-loamy over Cd layers. Retriever soils contain more than 40 percent calcium carbonate. Rimrock soils are moderately deep and deep and have fine texture."
