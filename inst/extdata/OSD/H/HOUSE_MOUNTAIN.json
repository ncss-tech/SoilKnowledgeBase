  "OVERVIEW": "The House Mountain series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from basalt. The House Mountain soils are on uplands and have slopes of 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
