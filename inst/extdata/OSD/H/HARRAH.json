  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Harrah series consists of soils that are very deep to sandstone bedrock, well drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy colluvium weathered from sandstone of Permian age. Harrah soils are on backslopes and foot slopes of hillslopes on low hills. The slope range is 3 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm (34 in).",
