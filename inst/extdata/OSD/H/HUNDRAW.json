  "OVERVIEW": "The Hundraw series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff or sedimentary rocks with loess and volcanic ash.  Hundraw soils are on hills and rock pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
