Foxcan soils have less than 5 percent calcium carbonate.  Grina soils are 36 to 50 cm to a paralithic contact and have 20 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Holborn soils have 18 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Jacratz soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Puett soils are 25 to 50 cm to a paralithic contact.  Stu soils are 25 to 50 cm to a paralithic contact and have mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 13 degrees C.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Hundraw soils are on hills and rock pediments.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuffs and sedimentary rocks with loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 10.5 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."
