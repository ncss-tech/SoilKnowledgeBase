  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist and is saturated for several months each year.  The soil cracks open and closes once each year during the summer.  It remains open for 60 consecutive days or more in most years.  The soil is dry for 45 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 56 degrees F.  Hue is 7.5YR to 2.5Y.  It is neutral to strongly acid in the upper 26 inches and neutral to slightly acid below. Slickensides are close enough to intersect in all parts or in some parts between a depth of 10 to 40 inches, but are lacking in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches.  It has distinct or prominent redox concentrations throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  The upper part to a depth of 12 inches commonly has chroma of 2 but has chroma of 1 in the lower part in some pedons.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam, and is 30 to 60 percent clay.  It has weak to strong granular or very fine to medium subangular structure.\nThe Bss horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 moist, 2 or 3 dry.  It is 40 to 65 percent clay and has 0 to 5 percent gravel.  It has weak coarse prismatic or coarse angular blocky structure or wedge shaped aggregates.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly clay, clay, or sandy clay, with 40 to 55 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent gravel. It has common to many distinct or prominent redox concentrations as masses and concretions."

Coker soils are dry for 80 to 110 consecutive days, are moderately alkaline below 20 inches, and have secondary carbonates below 20 inches.  Padigan soils are moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline in the particle-size control section, have secondary carbonates below 20 inches, and have chroma of 1 or less in the upper 10 to 15 inches of the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Natroy soils are on slightly concave flood plains, terraces, and gently sloping fans.  Elevations are 300 to 1,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils are formed in fine textured mixed alluvium.  The climate is characterized by cool and moist winters and warm and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches and occurs mostly as rain during the late autumn, winter, and spring.  The mean January temperature is 40 degrees F., mean July temperature is 67 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."
