  "OVERVIEW": "The Neiber series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material from soft, calcareous sandstone interbedded with shale.  Neiber soils are on upland backslopes and footslopes and have slopes of 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
