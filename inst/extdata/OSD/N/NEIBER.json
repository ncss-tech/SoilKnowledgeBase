The soils formed in residuum or locally transported material weathered from soft, calcareous sandstone interbedded with shale.  Elevation is 4,000 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 140 days."
