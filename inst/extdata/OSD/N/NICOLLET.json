  "OVERVIEW": "The Nicollet series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy glacial till on till plains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).   Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm (28 inches).",

The lower part of the B horizon has value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. When matrix chroma is 3 or 4, low chroma mottles are present or the layer is less than 6 inches thick.

They formed in friable, calcareous loam and clay loam glacial till of Late Wisconsinan age. The climate is humid continental with warm summers and cold winters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 813 mm (26 to 32 inches). Frost free days range from 155 to 200.
