  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 51 to 122 cm (20 to 48 inches). The mollic epipedon is 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches) thick. Rock fragments of mixed lithology are 1 to 8 percent throughout. The 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inch) series control section averages between 24 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. The lower part of the B horizon has value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. When matrix chroma is 3 or 4, low chroma mottles are present or the layer is less than 6 inches thick. The B horizon is dominantly clay loam, but loam and silty clay loam are within the range. It is moderately acid to neutral in the upper part and slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe BC or C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. The moderately fine substratum phase has textures of loam or clay loam. It has 20 to 30 percent clay and less than 45 percent total sand. The moderately coarse substratum phase has textures of loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. It has 12 to 22 percent clay and more than 40 percent total sand."

Arkton and Crippin soils have free lime within 51 cm (20 inches )of the surface, and average more the 35 percent fine sand or coarser in the series control section. Fostoria soils have less than 1 percent rock fragments throughout the series control section. Merton, Ottosen and Snider soils have less than 1 percent course fragments in the upper part of the profile. Kensett soils have a lithic contact at 51 to 61 cm (20 to 24 inches). Readlyn soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid and have less than 1 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Wilmonton soils are slightly to strongly alkaline and have secondary carbonates in the upper part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nicollet soils have slightly convex or plane slopes. They are on till plains, ground moraines, and terminal moraines. Their slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. They formed in friable, calcareous loam and clay loam glacial till of Late Wisconsinan age. The climate is humid continental with warm summers and cold winters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 813 mm (26 to 32 inches). Frost free days range from 155 to 200. Elevation is 244 to 479 m (800 to 1,570 feet) above sea level."

The well drained Clarion, Storden and Swanlake soils are generally on the more convex slopes and higher in the landscape. Poorly drained Canisteo and Webster soils are on broad nearly level areas. Very poorly drained Glencoe and Okoboji soils are in depressions and swales."
