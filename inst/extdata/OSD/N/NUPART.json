  "OVERVIEW": "The Nupart series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Nupart soils are on mountains and rock pediments.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rocks such as granite and granodiorite.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 5 to 10 percent.\nRock fragments:  Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly fine (2 to 5 mm) gravel.  Lithology of fragments is granitic rocks such as granite or granodiorite.\nA1 horizon\nValue: 4 to 5 dry.\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.\nStructure: Subangular blocky or is single grain.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.\nA2 horizon\nValue: 4 to 5 dry.\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand.\nRock fragments: 35 to 65 percent.\nStructure: Subangular blocky or is single grain.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent."
