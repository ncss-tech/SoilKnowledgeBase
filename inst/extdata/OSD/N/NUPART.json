The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rocks such as granite and granodiorite.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content:  Averages 5 to 10 percent.\nRock fragments:  Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly fine (2 to 5 mm) gravel.  Lithology of fragments is granitic rocks such as granite or granodiorite.\nA1 horizon\nValue: 4 to 5 dry.\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.\nStructure: Subangular blocky or is single grain.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.\nA2 horizon\nValue: 4 to 5 dry.\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand.\nRock fragments: 35 to 65 percent.\nStructure: Subangular blocky or is single grain.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,650 to 2,680 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
