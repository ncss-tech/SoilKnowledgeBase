Ashmed, Bitter and Timosea soils are dry in the moisture control section during the summer months. Blind soils average fewer rock fragments and have higher clay content in the control section. They also receive more total rainfall and have a MAAT of 59 to 64 degrees F. Bluebird soils receive more total precipitation and have higher clay content in the control section. Highland soils have bedrock at 30 to 40 inches. Khyber soils have 40 to 80 percent of the gravel fraction in the 2 to 5 mm range. Pinaleno, Soledad, and Topawa soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 20 days, cumulative, between July and October. In addition, Pinaleno soils have a calcic horizon, Soledad soils have 8 to 18 percent clay in the control section, and Topawa soils have a MAST of 69 to 72 degrees F. Twobitter soils are on patina surfaces, average fewer rock fragments in the control section, and are underlain by sand. In addition, Twobitter soils have a layer within the argillic which contains visible gypsum crystals. Werewolf soils have a MAST of 64 to 68 degrees F., receive more rainfall, and are formed in dominantly volcanic material."

The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches. The mean annual temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Yermo soils are on similar landscape positions but do not have argillic horizons."
