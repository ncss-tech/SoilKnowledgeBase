  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nizhoni soils are on cuestas and structural benches.   They formed in eolian and residuum derived from Triassic and early Jurassic sandstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 6,200 to 7,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chazner, Katzine, Tsezhin, and Wetherill soils.  Chazner soils are moderately deep to an indurated calcium carbonate hardpan and occur on treads of fan terraces.   Katzine soils are very deep, loamy-skeletal and occur on risers of fan terraces.  Tsezhin soils are very deep, loamy-skeletal and occur on fan terrace treads.  Wetherill soils are very deep, fine-silty and occur on eolian-mantled surfaces."
