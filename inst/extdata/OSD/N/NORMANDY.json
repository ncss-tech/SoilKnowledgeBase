  "OVERVIEW": "The Normandy series consists of very deep, poorly drained, calcareous soils that formed in loamy alluvium overlying sandy alluvium and outwash. These soils are on flood plains on outwash plains. They have moderate permeability. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick. These soils typically contain 2 to 8 percent by volume of rock fragments of mixed lithology, although in some pedons the upper 25 inches do not have rock fragments. Carbonates are in all parts of the fine-earth fraction between 10 and 20 inches. The particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent sand coarser than very fine. The lower one-fourth to one-third of the series control section averages more than 75 percent sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout the series control section. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 20 percent.\nThe upper one-fourth to one-third of the control section (Ap, Akp, or A horizon) has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. It is loam or silt loam.\nThe middle one-third to one-half of the control section (Bg or Bkg horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is clay loam, loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.\nThe lower one-fourth to one-third of the control section (2Cg horizon) has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is sand or loamy sand. The calcium carbonate equivalent is generally higher in the 2C horizon than in the overlying horizons."

Merden soils average less than 75 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Oshawa soils do not have rock fragments within 60 inches. Scipio soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone and quartzite and do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Uncompahgre soils formed in calcareous alluvium derived from mixed sources and do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Voltaire soils have 15 percent or more exchangeable sodium in the upper one-half of the particle-size control section."
