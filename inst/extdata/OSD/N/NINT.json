  "OVERVIEW": "The Nint series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and some residuum from basalt with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface. They are on canyon walls, hillslopes, dissected plateaus and piedmont slopes. Slopes are 0[SW1] to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
