These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick and includes all or part of the argillic horizon. The upper 7 to 13 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 grams per cubic centimeter, volcanic glass content of 7 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section has 27 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in the A horizon. Solum thickness and depth to the lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist. Texture is gravelly ashy loam or stony ashy loam.\nThe BAt horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. Texture is gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam.[SW2]\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4, dry or moist.

These soils formed in colluvium and some residuum from basaltwith an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface. Elevations are 2,000 to 3,600 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 [SW4]inches. The average January temperature is 25 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 69 degrees F. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 110 to 135 days."
