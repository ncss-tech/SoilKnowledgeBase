  "OVERVIEW": "The Nomad series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone over residuum derived from the Greenhorn limestone member of the Mancos Shale formation.  Nomad soils are on structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
