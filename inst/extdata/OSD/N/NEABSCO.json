    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 4o to 60 inches deep.  Depth to fragipan ranges from 14 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments of rounded quartz gravel range from 0 to 10 percent in the A and upper B horizons and from 1 to 35 percent in the fragipan and lower B horizon.  The C horizon ranges from 1 to more than 50 percent quartz gravel.  The substratum is commonly stratified Coastal Plain sediments but ranges to loamy residuum from the Piedmont schist and gneiss.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The A and E is sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe E Horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  The Bx is commonly varigated and includes low chroma mottles.  It is sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon is commonly mottled in shades of brown, yellow, red and gray.  They range from gravelly sand through clay in individual strata."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Neabsco soils are on broad drainage divides of the older Northern Coastal Plain terraces.  Elevations generally range from 150 to 300 feet.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent but most areas are from 0 to 7 percent.  The soil developed in stratified fluvio-marine sediments.  On areas where the sediments are thin, these soils are underlain by residuum from Piedmont schist and gneiss.  Mean annual precipitation range from 36 to 44 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 degrees to 59 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Buckhall, Chester, Fairfax, Lunt and Quantico soils.  All these associated soils do not have a fragipan.  In addition the Buckhall and Chester soils are developed in residuum from gneiss and schist.  The Fairfax soil is developed partly in Coastal Plains sediments and partly in Piedmont residuum.  The Quantico and Lunt soils have higher clay content in their subsoils."
