The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  Depth to a lithic or paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches or more.  The solum is weakly to moderately smeary and has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cubic centimeter.  It has acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron of 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 90 to 100 percent and over 2 meq. of aluminum per 100 grams of soil.  It is extremely acid or very strongly acid.  The umbric epipedon, when present, is 10 to 20 inches or more thick; some pedons have an ochric epipedon with moist chromas of 4 above 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
