    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to IIC\nhorizon ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Depth to the IIR layer\nranges from 55 to 65 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates is\nmore than 36 inches.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and\nchroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is cobbly and very cobbly phases of\nsilt loam and loam.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral.  Content\nof coarse fragments of limestone ranges from 35 to 70 percent by volume.  About 15 to 30 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter, and 20 to 40 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and\nchroma of 2 to 6.  Texture, reaction, and content of coarse\nfragments is the same as the A1 horizon.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4\nto 8.  Texture is cobbly or very cobbly phases of clay loam, silty clay loam, cobbly loam, or silt loam.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral.  Content of coarse fragments is the same as the A1\nhorizon.\nThe IIC horizon is coarsely mottled in shades of brown, red, gray, and yellow.  The gray mottles are inherited from the parent\nmaterial and are not indicative of wetness.  Content of coarse fragments less than 76 mm in diameter makes up 0 to 5 percent by volume.  Some pedons are neutral to moderately alkaline and noncalcareous.\nThe IIR layer is indurated limestone conglomerate that is several feet thick and is tilted less than 20 degrees from horizontal.  In some areas, minor amounts of granite fragments are present in the conglomerate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Naru soils are on sloping to steep side\nslopes of low ridges or hills north of the Arbuckle Mountains in\nthe Grand Prairie.  The upper part of these soils formed in colluvium, and the lower part formed in shaly clays and hard conglomerate of Pennsylvanian age.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.\nMean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 40 inches.  Mean\nannual temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 54 to 64."

Rayford and Travertine soils usually occur\non ridges, and they have a solum less than 20 inches thick."
