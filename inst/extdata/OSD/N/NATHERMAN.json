  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The NATHERMAN series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from metamorphic and sedimentary rock.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and eroded fan remnants. These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.8 degrees C.",
