  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between depths of 4 to 12 inches is moist in some part in November or December to April 1 but is usually not moist for as long as 90 consecutive days.  It is usually dry from April 1 to November 1.  The organic carbon content is less than 0.5 percent at a depth of 10 inches and decreases regularly with depth.  The soil is saline-sodic in some part.  Cracks 1/4 inch to 2 inches wide extend to depths of 20 inches or more during the summer and have horizontal spacing of 5 to 25 inches.  The cracks remain open for more than 240 days in most years and are closed for periods only up to 60 consecutive days. Wedge-shaped aggregates tilted more than 60 degrees from the horizontal occur in a layer at least 6 inches thick within 50 inches of the soil surface. Some pedons have gypsum crystals within the profile, which have been added as a soil amendment by farmers. The mean annual soil temperature varies from 65 degrees to 67 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 4/1, 4/2; or 2.5Y 5/4, 6/2, 6/4 and 7/2, and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2; or 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4 and 5/4.  It is clay loam or clay.  Clay content is 35 to 50 percent.  Overwash phases exist which have silt loam surface layers with 20 to 27 percent clay. Electrical conductivity ranges from 1 to 16 decisiemens per meter and sodium adsorption ratio is 2 to 80.  The upper part of the A horizon is noneffervescent to violently effervescent. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to 14 percent, but all parts of the 10 to 20 inch zone are at least slightly effervescent.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1, 6/2, 6/3; 5Y 7/3, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 6/4, 7/2 or 7/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4 and 5Y 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4.  It is clay loam, silty clay or clay in the upper part of the C horizon with 35 to 50 percent clay content.  Below a depth of 40 inches it is stratified sandy loam to silty clay with 15 to 50 percent clay content.  Salinity typically increases with depth and the electrical conductivity ranges from 8 to 30 decisiemens per meter.  The sodium adsorption ratio ranges from 30 to 300.  In some pedons toxic amounts of boron and arsenic may be present.  Some pedons have 1 to 10 percent durinodes in the lower C horizon Calcium carbonate equivalent content ranges from 1 to 10 percent throughout the horizon.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nahrub soils are in basins and on basin rims.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from granitic rocks but some sedimentary alluvium may also have influenced some of the parent material.  Elevations are 160 to 250 feet.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool somewhat moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 83 degrees F.; mean annual temperature varies from 63 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 225 to 300 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained under present conditions because of flood control measures, ditches and pumping.  Under natural conditions the soil had a high water table.  Some areas are ponded. Runoff is medium or high; very slow permeability.  The soils are subject to rare flooding but are protected by dams and/or levees."
