Texture is silt loam or loam.  Structure is fine granular or subangular blocky.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is typically silty clay loam but may be silt loam.  Clay ranges form 20 to 35 percent.  Clay films occur on faces of peds.  Structure is prismatic or subangular blocky.
