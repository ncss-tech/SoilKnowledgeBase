    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Combined thickness of the organic horizons ranges from 21 to 36 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 21 to 42 inches.  pH is less than 4.5 throughout the profile.  The profile does not freeze below a depth of 2 inches due to a maritime climate.\nThe Oa horizons have hue ranging from 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma from 1 to 4.\nSome pedons have a C horizon, ranging up to 6 inches thick, overlying the bedrock.  Texture of the C horizon is sandy loam, loam or gravelly loam."
