  "OVERVIEW": "The Nupper series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone. The Nupper soils are on mountain side slopes. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
