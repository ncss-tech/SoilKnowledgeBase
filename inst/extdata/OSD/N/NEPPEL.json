These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches.  Depth to the 3Bk horizon is 24 to 40 inches.  The A and Bw horizons are neutral or slightly alkaline.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand and averages 2 to 10 percent pebbles and 0 to 2 percent cobbles and stones.  The lower part of the particle-size control section contains 35 to 85 percent coarse fragments.  The coarse fragments include 20 to 30 percent lime-silica cemented fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  This horizon has weak subangular blocky or prismatic structure.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk1 horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bkq horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly fine sandy loam, gravelly very fine sandy loam, or very gravelly very fine sandy loam.\nThe 3Bk2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and value of 6, 7, or 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.  It is extremely gravelly sand, very gravelly sand or extremely gravelly coarse sand."

They formed in alluvium or glacial outwash from basalt, lime-silica cemented material and granite with a mixture of loess in the upper part.  Elevations are 400 to 1,300 feet.  The climate is arid having an annual precipitation of 6 to 9 inches, and with dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average January temperature is 27 degrees F, average July temperature is 71 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 135 to 200 days."
