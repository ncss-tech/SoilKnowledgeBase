  "OVERVIEW": "The Noagua series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. The Noagua soils are on alluvial fans over fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C.",
