  "OVERVIEW": "The Ngerungor series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in depressions on wet coastal bottom lands. These soils formed in deposits of organic material overlying coral sand. Slope is 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual rainfall ranges about 3683 millimeters (145 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.)",

This horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Rubbed fiber content throughout the profile ranges from 20 to 40 percent by volume. Reaction in calcium chloride ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid, but maybe neutral next to the sandy substratum.\nA 2C horizon may be present in some pedons and has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is sand or loamy sand and is gravelly in some pedons. It is 0 to 15 percent gravel up to 8 centimeters (3 inches) in size. A thin mucky transitional layer is present in some pedons. Reaction in 1:1 water is neutral through moderately alkaline."
