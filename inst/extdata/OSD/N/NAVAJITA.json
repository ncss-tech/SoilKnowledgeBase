  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Navajita soils are on north-facing footslopes and toeslopes of valley sides.  They formed from slope alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

Zacaton soils are ashy-skeletal, do not have argillic horizons, and are on north-facing backslopes of mesas."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of about 2 inches. (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 8 inches to a depth of about 57 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 8 to 28 inches (Bt1 and part of the Bt2 horizon)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nNote: This soil has moderate amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt plus sand fractions.  It has less volcanic ash than other nearby less developed soils because of the influence of introduced slope alluvium. Even though lower horizons contain more glass than upper horizons, it does not contain enough glass to make a Vitritorrandic subgroup.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
