Agustin, Filaree, Hayhook, and Sahuarita soils receive more precipitation (from 175 to 275 millimeters). In addition, Agustin soils are moist for longer than 20 days following summer convection storms and allow strata of sandy clay loam textures. Filaree and Hayhook soils also are noneffervescent above 50 centimeters (20 inches). Hayhook and Pajarito soils are moist for more than 20 days cumulative following summer convection storms. Lostman soils have 5 to 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the particle size control section which increases with depth. Pyxo soils are moderately deep to calcareous sedimentary weathered bedrock. Sahuarita soils have a buried argillic horizon below 50 centimeters (20 inches)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Nasagold soils are on fan aprons, alluvial flats and fan skirts. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in material from mixed alluvium. Elevations are 2,100 to 4,500 feet (640 to 1372 meters). The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 175 millimeters (3 to 7 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 20 degrees C (55 to 68 degrees F.). The frost-free season is 240 to 320 days."

Crackerjack soils are shallow to a weakly to moderately-cemented duripan. Cronese soils have a calcic horizon. Goldivide soils are on smooth fan remnants and are moderately deep to an argillic horizon. Granitepass soils are higher on the landscape and do not have a cambic horizon. Tipnat soils are on similar landscape positions, have a fine-loamy particle size control section, and have a natric horizon."
