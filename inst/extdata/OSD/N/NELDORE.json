  "OVERVIEW": "The Neldore series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in clayey residuum or colluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale or in clayey alluvium over the semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on escarpments, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
