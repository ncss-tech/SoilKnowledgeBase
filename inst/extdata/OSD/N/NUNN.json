    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is 47 to 54 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 59 to 79 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 19 inches thick, depth to lime is 10 to 30 inches, and the solum is 16 to 46 inches thick.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .8 to 3 percent.  The soil is typically 90 to 100 percent base-saturated.  Rock fragments are typically less than 5 percent and range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F or warmer for about 200 to 240 days.  The soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for about 56 to 152 days while the soil temperature is 41 degrees F or above.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Usually it has granular or crumb structure but the structure is subangular blocky in some pedons.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 7, 2 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is typically clay, silty clay loam or clay loam and has 35 to 50 percent clay, 15 to 45 percent silt, and 15 to 45 percent sand with more than 15 percent, being fine sand or coarser.  Some pedons have sandy clay loam textures in the lower parts of the argillic layer, however, the weighted clay average is greater than 35 percent in the control section.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.   CEC of the Bt horizon ranges from 60 to 90 millequivalents per 100 grams of clay.\nThe Bk or C horizon has hue of 5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are typically clay loam with more than 28 percent clay, however, where the C horizon has less than 28 percent clay it contains more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand and has a texture of sandy clay loam, loam or sandy loam.  These horizons are slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline and have 4 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Ashfork, Bethune, Chapin, Thunderbird and Wormser soils have lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.   Blackpipe, Boquillas, Emigrant, Huggins, Leyden and Querc soils have paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Boneek, Kube, Richfield, Savo and Weld soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the Bt horizon.  Collbran, Collide, Loma and Rednun soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the Bt.  Ryus soils are calcareous throughout.    Showlow soils have a calcic horizon.  Standley soils have greater than 15 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon.  The Nuncho soils have soil temperatures at 20 inches that are greater than 41 degrees F. for less than 200 days."
