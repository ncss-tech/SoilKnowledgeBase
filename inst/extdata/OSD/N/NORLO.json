  "OVERVIEW": "The Norlo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in ash over colluvium from tuffs, basalts, rhyolites and mezozoic marine sediments on mountain sideslopes and benches.  Slopes are 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
