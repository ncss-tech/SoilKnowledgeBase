Badena soils have 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms.  Badenaugh soils have A and Bt horizons 69 to 109 cm thick, mollic epipedons less than 36 cm thick, are neutral or slightly acid in the upper part decreasing to slightly acid or moderately acid in the lower part.  Eaglerock, Trid, and Searvar soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, and Searles soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Lemm soils have A and Bt horizons 76 to 122 cm thick and sandy loam argillic horizons with less than 18 clay.  Leviathan soils have mollic epipedons 23 to 36 cm thick and subhorizons of sandy clay loam or sandy clay in the argillic horizon.  Oest soils have A and Bt horizons 76 to 127 cm thick, sandy loam or sandy clay loam argillic horizons with 18 to 27 percent clay, and very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand below 100 cm.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nosrac soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on north-facing backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from andesite and schist.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,525 to 2,320 meters.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
