    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 48 to 107 cm (19 to 42 in). Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm (60 in). Rock fragments are generally absent, but can range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the surface and subsurface horizons, and from 0 to 15 percent in the subsoil and substratum. Combined thickness of the Bhs and/or Bh and Bs horizons ranges from 18 to 81 cm (7 to 32 in) thick.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, or is neutral, with value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 4. The organic materials are usually well decomposed plant materials derived predominantly from woody vegetation with a smaller amount from herbaceous. The rubbed fiber content is less than 15 percent of the volume. An Oe horizon, up to 2 inches thick, may overlie the Oa horizon in some pedons.\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. Ap horizons are up to 36 cm (14 in) thick and have dry color values of 6. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid unless limed.\nThe Eg or E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand. Consistence is friable to loose. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bh horizon that has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from loamy fine sand to sand. Structure is often weak granular or subangular blocky, but some pedons have single grain. Consistence ranges from very friable to loose, and some pedons have up to 35 percent firm or extremely firm parts. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, and value and chroma of 2 to 3. The fine-earth fraction ranges from loamy fine sand to sand. Structure is often weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky. Some pedons are single grain or massive. Consistence is very friable to loose, but can contain up to 20 percent firm parts. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy fine sand to sand. Consistence is very friable to loose, but can contain up to 20 percent firm or very firm parts. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy fine sand to coarse sand. Consistence is very friable or loose, but some horizons are up to 20 percent firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Cg or C horizon have hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Kinsman and Naskeag series are in the same family. Kinsman soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments or gravel. Naskeag has bedrock at 50 to 100 cm (20 to 40 in).\nThe Otisco and Saugatuck and series are similar soils in related families. Saugatuck and Otisco soils are from outside of Region R. Otisco soils have argillic horizons. Saugatuck soils have a mesic temperature regime and have ortstein in the spodic horizon in more than 50 percent of each pedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Naumburg soils occupy low-lying areas of sand plains or terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in glaciofluvial or deltaic sands predominantly from areas of granitic rocks or acid sandstone. Some areas are associated with calcareous till, and in these places the ground water and C horizon are slightly acid. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1270 mm (30 to 50 in); mean annual air temperature ranges from about 3 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F) and the mean frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days. The elevation ranges from 46 to 914 m (150 to 3000 ft) above sea level."

The somewhat excessively Adams soils and the moderately well drained Croghan soils are drainage associates. Colton, Duane, and Constable soils formed in associated gravelly and very gravelly deposits. Nicholville and Salmon soils formed in silty deposits on nearby terraces."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Predominantly wooded or idle. A few areas are used for growing hay or pasture. Idle areas support poplar and birch saplings or are covered by sparse stands of grass with Spirea and similar shrubs. Forested areas support spruce, pine, balsam fir, hemlock, and some hardwoods such as maples."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A new typical pedon was selected in 1996 to better represent the central concept of the series.  Minerology was changed to isotic to conform with 7th Edition of Keys to Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Albic horizon - the zone from 5 to 18 cm (2 to 7 in) (E horizon).\n2. Spodic horizon - the zone from 18 to 46 cm (7 to 18 in) (Bhs and Bs horizons).\n3. Aquods suborder - as evidenced by an aquic moisture regime and redoximorphic features within 50 cm (20 in) of the surface in a spodic horizon (Bhs and Bs horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Analytical data for three pedons show 6 to 17 percent organic matter in the Bh horizon. The ratio of the sum of percent extractable C+Fe+A1 to percent clay in 2 pedons ranged from 0.20 to 3.53 in the Bh and Bhs horizons. Feldspars were about 30 percent of the sand fraction.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
