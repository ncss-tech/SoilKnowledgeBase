  "OVERVIEW": "The Naumburg series consists of very deep, poorly and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy deltaic or glaciofluvial deposits. These soils are on low sand plains and terraces. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity in the mineral soil is high or very high in the solum and in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C (42 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 in).",

Rock fragments are generally absent, but can range from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the surface and subsurface horizons, and from 0 to 15 percent in the subsoil and substratum. Combined thickness of the Bhs and/or Bh and Bs horizons ranges from 18 to 81 cm (7 to 32 in) thick.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, or is neutral, with value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 4. The organic materials are usually well decomposed plant materials derived predominantly from woody vegetation with a smaller amount from herbaceous. The rubbed fiber content is less than 15 percent of the volume. An Oe horizon, up to 2 inches thick, may overlie the Oa horizon in some pedons.\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. Ap horizons are up to 36 cm (14 in) thick and have dry color values of 6.

Consistence ranges from very friable to loose, and some pedons have up to 35 percent firm or extremely firm parts. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, and value and chroma of 2 to 3. The fine-earth fraction ranges from loamy fine sand to sand. Structure is often weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky. Some pedons are single grain or massive.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Naumburg soils occupy low-lying areas of sand plains or terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in glaciofluvial or deltaic sands predominantly from areas of granitic rocks or acid sandstone. Some areas are associated with calcareous till, and in these places the ground water and C horizon are slightly acid. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1270 mm (30 to 50 in); mean annual air temperature ranges from about 3 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F) and the mean frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days. The elevation ranges from 46 to 914 m (150 to 3000 ft) above sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A new typical pedon was selected in 1996 to better represent the central concept of the series.  Minerology was changed to isotic to conform with 7th Edition of Keys to Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Albic horizon - the zone from 5 to 18 cm (2 to 7 in) (E horizon).\n2. Spodic horizon - the zone from 18 to 46 cm (7 to 18 in) (Bhs and Bs horizons).\n3. Aquods suborder - as evidenced by an aquic moisture regime and redoximorphic features within 50 cm (20 in) of the surface in a spodic horizon (Bhs and Bs horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Analytical data for three pedons show 6 to 17 percent organic matter in the Bh horizon. The ratio of the sum of percent extractable C+Fe+A1 to percent clay in 2 pedons ranged from 0.20 to 3.53 in the Bh and Bhs horizons. Feldspars were about 30 percent of the sand fraction.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
