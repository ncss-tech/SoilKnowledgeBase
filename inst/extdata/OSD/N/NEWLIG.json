Aptos and Paragon soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Buckeye and Kiakus soils are moderatley deep to a lithic contact. Campfour soils formed in residuum or colluvium from andesite or basalt, and have moist hues of 5YR or 2.5YR, have 27 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 30 percent gravel in the argillic horizon. Cartwright soils have 5 to 25 percent gravel in the argillic horizon, are in a 15 to 22 inch precipitation zone, and formed in colluvium and alluvium from granite. Elmore soils are deep to a lithic contact. Hyprairie soils have a lithologic discontinuity. Lauby soils have buried argillic horizons. Nisene and Rudo soils are deep to a paralithic contact. Roseburg soils have a BCt horizon and are in a 30 to 60 inch precipitation zone. Swalecreek soils have Bat and Btc horizons. Yaxing soils are slightly alkaline in the particle-size control section, are in a 16 to 18 inch precipitation zone, and formed in material weathered from sandstone."
