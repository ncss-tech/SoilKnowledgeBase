  "BYREV": "Rev. WMK:RBH",
  "REVDATE": "10/2021",
  "STATES": "AR,LA,MS,TN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Natchez series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in thick deposits of loess. Permeability is moderate, and runoff is rapid to very rapid. These strongly sloping to very steep soils are on hillsides in the highly dissected bluff hills section of the Southern Mississippi Silty Uplands that border the alluvial plains of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. Slope ranges from 12 to 60 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 18 to 48 inches. The A and B horizons range from strongly acid to neutral. The C horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam or silt. The 10- to 40-inch control section has 7 to 18 percent clay and sand is less than 10 percent.\nThe C horizon has the same range in color and texture as the B horizon. It is neutral to moderately alkaline. Shell fragments are few to many."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Closely related series are the Ariel, Bruin, Memphis Nixonton, and Tutwiler. Ariel and Bruin soils have organic carbon content that decrease irregularly with depth. In addition, Bruin soils have mottles of chroma of 2 or less within a depth of 24 inches from the surface. Memphis and Tutwiler soils have an argillic horizon. In addition, Memphis soils are fine-silty. Nixonton soils have base saturation of less than 60 percent within the upper 30 inches of the soil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 12 to 50 percent. These soils formed in thick loess accumulations that are high in silt and low in sand and leached of carbonates in the upper part. Near the type location the average annual temperature is 63 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is 52 inches near the type location."
