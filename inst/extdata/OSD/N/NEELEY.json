  "OVERVIEW": "The Neeley series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in deep loess. They are on lake terraces and uplands.  Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 0 to 55 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches. The average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
