  "OVERVIEW": "The Nimrod series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in locally reworked eolian sands over residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone. These nearly level to moderately sloping soils occur on interfluves and side slopes of low ridges on hills. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm (31 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 17.6 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
