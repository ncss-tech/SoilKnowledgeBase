    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 62 degrees to 70 degrees F. The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches deep with irregular decrease in organic matter with increasing depth. The base saturation above depth of 40 inches is estimated to be less than 75 percent in at least some part.\nThe A, BC, and 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 3 or less. It is loam, fine sandy loam, or gravelly loam. It has weak or moderate granular structure in the upper part and is massive in the lower part. This horizon is slightly to strongly acid.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y."
