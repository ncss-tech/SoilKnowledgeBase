  "OVERVIEW": "The Nittaw series consists of very poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in thick deposits of clayey sediments of marine origin.  These soils are in well defined drainageways, broad, nearly level swamps, and marshes of central and southern peninsular Florida.  They are subject to flooding and water standing above the soil surface for 6 months or more in most years during late spring, summer and fall.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.",

Few to many, fine to coarse mottles of gray, brown, olive, and yellow are in this horizon in some pedons.  Some pedons have few, medium or coarse pockets of grayish brown, gray, or light gray sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the B22tg and B23tg horizons.  Few to many, fine to coarse mottles and pockets of light gray and white carbonatic material also occur in these horizons in some pedons.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  In some pedons, the Bg horizon extends to depths of more than 80 inches.\nThe Cg horizon has hues of 10YR or 5Y, value 5 through 8, chroma 1 or 2; hue 2.5Y, value 5 through 7, chroma 2; hue of N and value 5 through 7; or hue 5GY, value 4 through 6, chroma 1.

All these soils lack histic epipedons.  Chobee and Copeland soils have mixed mineralogy and are in a fine-loamy family.  In addition, Copeland soils have limestone at depths greater than 30 inches.  Delray soils have A horizons more than 40 inches thick and Floridana and Gentry soils have A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Delray soils have mixed mineralogy and Floridana soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Manatee soils are in a coarse-loamy family and have mixed mineralogy.  Rio soils have mixed mineralogy and are in the thermic region."

Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent but range up to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 50 to 55 inches.  Rainfall is unevenly distributed with most of it occurring during the months of June through September."
