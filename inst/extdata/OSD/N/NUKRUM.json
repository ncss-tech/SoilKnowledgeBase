Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in) (A and Bw horizons)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 61 cm (0 to 24 in)(Ap and A horizons)\nCambic horizon: 61 to 142 cm (24 to 56 in)(Bw horizon).\nCalcic horizon: 142 to 203 cm (56 to 80 in) (BCk horizon)\nVertic feature: the occurrence of dry weather cracks from 1 to 3 cm (0.4 to 1.2 in) wide that extend from the surface to more than 51 cm (20 in) in depth. The particle-size control section has 38 to 60 percent clay.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
