  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nukrum series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous clayey slope alluvium derived from claystone. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on footslopes and toeslopes of hillslopes on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
