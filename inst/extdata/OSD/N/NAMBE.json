  "OVERVIEW": "The Nambre series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from granite, gneiss and schist.  Nambre soils are on mountain sideslopes and have slopes of 20 to 100 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 32 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 18 to 36 inches thick.  The soil is extremely acid to strongly acid (pH 4.0 to 5.5).  Base saturation ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 33 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F.  Surface textures are loam and sandy loam with 0 to 20 percent gravel and cobbles.  Stones range from 30 to 50 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 50 to 80 percent in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe B21ir horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 4.5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The B22ir horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  The B21ir and B22ir horizons are typically sandy loam but range in clay from 6 to 15 percent, in silt from 5 to 30 percent, and in sand from 55 to 80 percent."
