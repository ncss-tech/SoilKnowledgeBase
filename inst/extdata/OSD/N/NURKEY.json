    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nurkey soils are on mountain sides and foothills and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent. Elevations are 5,500 to 9,000 feet. The soils formed in slope alluvium weathered from extrusive igneous rocks and slate. The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and cool and dry in summer. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. Mean summer temperature is 53 to 60 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F. Frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
