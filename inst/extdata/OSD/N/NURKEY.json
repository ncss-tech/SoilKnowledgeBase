  "OVERVIEW": "The Nurkey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium from extrusive igneous rocks and slate on foothills and mountain sides. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
