The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered volcanic rocks such as andesitic tuff.\nSodium fluoride pH: 8.5 to 9.0.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 12 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly pebbles.  Lithology of rock fragments are hydrothermally altered volcanic rocks such as andesitic tuff.\nA and AC horizons\nHue: 7.5YR through 2.5Y.\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 6, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam.\nRock fragments: 35 to 50 percent, mainly gravel.\nClay content: 12 to 18 percent.\nReaction: Extremely acid, very strongly acid, or strongly acid.\nBase saturation: Less than 60 percent in the AC horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Newcone soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from hydrothermally altered andesitic rocks.  The parent rock has undergone acid-sulfate alteration resulting in a soil parent material that is enriched in aluminum and silicon and depleted in bases.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,830 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 410 to 610 mm, mean annual temperature is 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A and AC horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 15 cm to underlying weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A and AC horizons).\nThe isotic mineralogy class is based on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  The revision of November 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, acid, frigid, shallow Typic Xerorthents.  The current Dystric subgroup is based on the estimated low base saturation.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
