  "OVERVIEW": "The Nuby series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from basic igneous and sedimentary rocks. Nuby soils are on floodplains below 100 feet elevation and have slopes less than 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual air temperature is approximately 50 degrees F.",

The soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured alluvial deposits derived from basic igneous and sedimentary rocks. These soils occur in cool, coastal areas where the mean annual precipitation is 70 to 120 inches. The mean January temperature is 39 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. The frost free season is 160 and 200 days."
