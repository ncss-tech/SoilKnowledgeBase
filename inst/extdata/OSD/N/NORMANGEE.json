  "OVERVIEW": "The Normangee series consists of soils that are deep to weakly consolidated shale. They are moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that derived from shales and clays. These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 964 mm (38 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.1 degrees C (66.5 degrees F).",
