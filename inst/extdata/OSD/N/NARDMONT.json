    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The upper 7 to 14 inches of the soil has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay, 15 to 50 percent sand coarser than very fine sand, and 5 to 20 percent unweathered rock fragments. Base saturation is assumed to be about 35 percent in all parts.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe E horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bt horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma is 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Texture is loam, or gravelly loam.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 6 dry or moist."

Elevations are 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  The soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 120 to 150 days."
