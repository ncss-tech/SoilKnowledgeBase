These soils formed in eolian deposits and in part in material weathered from underlying sandstone. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The mean annual summer temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F., average annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches. The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
