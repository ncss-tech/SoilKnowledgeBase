  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Northdale series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and material weathered from sandstone. Northdale soils are on undulating to rolling uplands and have slopes of 2 to 10 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
