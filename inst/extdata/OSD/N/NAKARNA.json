  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nakarna soils are on mountain slopes and ridges. These soils formed in weathered material derived dominantly from decomposed micaceous schist and have a thick mantle of volcanic ash. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevation ranges from 485 to 1,525 meters. The climate is cool, humid with warm, moist summers and cool, wet winters. The average annual precipitation is 625 to 1,350 mm, and the average air temperature is 3.5 to 7.8 degrees C. The frost-free season is 50 to 110 days."

The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data available for Soil Survey Sample Number: S01WA-063-003 Spokane County, Washington.
