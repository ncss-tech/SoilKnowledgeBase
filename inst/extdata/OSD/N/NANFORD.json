    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 25 to 50 inches. Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the A, Ap, E, and Bt horizons, and 0 to 40 percent in the BC and C horizons. The solum is very strongly acid or strongly acid unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam and eroded areas may be silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Value of 2 or 3 is limited to horizons less than 6 inches thick. It is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, and eroded areas include silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction .\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow may occur. Texture is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, and clay loam in the fine-earth fraction with from 35 to 60 percent clay and more than 30 percent silt, or more than 40 percent silt plus very fine sand.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, or is mottled in shades of these colors. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is multicolored in shades of brown, red, yellow, gray, or white. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam saprolite in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, slightly fractured to highly fractured fine-grained metavolcanic rock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Brockroad, Catharpin, Georgeville, Herndon, and Tarrus series in the same family and the Nason and Tatum series in a closely related family. Brockroad and Catharpan soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section. Georgeville and Herndon soils do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches. Tarrus soils have Bt horizons with hue of 10R or 2.5YR.  Nason and Tatum soils have mixed mineralogy and formed predominantly in sericite schist."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nanford soils are on nearly level to steep uplands. Slope gradients are commonly between 2 and 15 percent, but the extreme range is 0 to 50 percent. The soils formed in residuum weathered from phyllites, slates and other fine grained rocks of the Carolina Slate Belt. The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches. Length of growing season ranges from 195 to 240 days."

Alamance and Kirksey soils have less than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Badin soils have mixed mineralogy and a depth to paralithic contact of 20 to 40 inches. Cid and Lignum soils have iron depletions in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizons. Gundy soils have a base saturation of greater than 35 percent. Goldston soils have a paralithic contact at less than 20 inches. Orange soils have a smectitic mineralogy and have a base sturation greater than 35 percent."
