Brockroad and Catharpan soils have a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section. Georgeville and Herndon soils do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches. Tarrus soils have Bt horizons with hue of 10R or 2.5YR.  Nason and Tatum soils have mixed mineralogy and formed predominantly in sericite schist."

The soils formed in residuum weathered from phyllites, slates and other fine grained rocks of the Carolina Slate Belt. The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches. Length of growing season ranges from 195 to 240 days."
