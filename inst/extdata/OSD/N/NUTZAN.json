They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff and similar pyroclastic (volcanic) rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,540 to 2,420 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."
