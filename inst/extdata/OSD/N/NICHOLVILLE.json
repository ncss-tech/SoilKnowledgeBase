  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 31 to 122 cm. Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 cm. Depth to contrasting deposits is greater than 76 cm, where present. Rock fragments, mostly gravel, range from 0 to 10 percent by volume throughout the soil. Redoximorphic features are within 75 cm of the mineral soil surface.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nIn undisturbed areas, the soil typically has an O horizon, an E horizon, and may also have a Bhs or Bh horizon. These are usually destroyed by plowing. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe Bhs horizon where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or less. The Bh horizon where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 4 or less. Texture ranges from loamy very fine sand to silt loam. Consistence is very friable to firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. In some pedons it has hue of 10YR in the lower part. Texture ranges from loamy very fine sand to silt loam. Consistence is very friable to firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture commonly ranges from very fine sand to silt loam but includes silt in some pedons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2C or C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture commonly ranges from very fine sand to silt loam but includes silt in some pedons. The horizon is single grain, massive, or has weak platy divisions associated with depositional layers. Consistence is very friable to firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.\nThe Dixmont, Madawaska, Roundabout, and Salmon series are in related families. Dixmont and Madawaska soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Roundabout soils are somewhat poorly and poorly drained. Salmon soils are well drained and do not have redoximorphic features."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nicholville soils are on nearly level to sloping planar or concave landscapes. They are on lake plains and upland till plains that have a mantle of wind or water-deposited silt or very fine sand. Normally, slopes range from 0 to 15 percent, but may range up to 60 percent on strongly dissected lacustrine deposits. In some areas, slowly permeable deposits underlie the soil below 102 cm and restricts internal drainage. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 8 degrees C, mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 50 inches, and the frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 37 to 610 meters above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adams, Becket, Colton, Crary, Potsdam, Roundabout, Salmon, and Worth soils. Well drained Salmon soils are on nearby higher convex areas. Adams and Colton soils are associated in materials high in gravel and sand content. Becket, Crary, Potsdam, and Worth soils formed in adjacent glacial till deposits. Somewhat poorly and poorly drained Roundabout soils are on more concave landscapes."
