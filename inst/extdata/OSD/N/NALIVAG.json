  "OVERVIEW": "The Nalivag series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from sandstone and shale.  The Nalivag soils are on hill slopes, valley terraces and relict stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
