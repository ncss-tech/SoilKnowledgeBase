  "OVERVIEW": "The Notom series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively to excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous volcanic sources.  Notom soils are on flood-plain steps.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches (229 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F (11 degrees C).",
