  "OVERVIEW": "The Nineveh series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are moderately deep to calcareous, stratified gravelly and sandy outwash. The Nineveh soils formed in loamy deposits. They are on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
