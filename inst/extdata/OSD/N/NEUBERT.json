  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to more than 72 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 72 inches.  Soil reaction is strongly acid to neutral throughout.  Content of  quartzose limestone, calcareous sandstone and shale gravel and channers in each horizon ranges from 0 to about 10 percent.  Few to many dark and brown concretions are present in most pedons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  In some pedons, this horizon may be covered with a recent deposition 1 to 4 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or rarely sandy clay or clay.  Some pedons have thin horizons of silt loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown, red, yellow or gray.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are present in some pedons below 24 inches.\nWhere present, the C horizon has colors and textures similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe Abg and Bgb horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 0 to 2, or have neural hue with value of 3 or 4.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Accumulations of iron and manganese range from few to many.  Many pedons have buried horizons below about 40 inches but buried horizons may not be observed in every pedon."

Alcoa soils formed in old alluvium and colluvium and are on adjacent foot slopes and stream terraces.  Redhill, Steekee and Tellico soils are on adjacent side slopes and ridges and formed in residuum or residuum that is affected by soil creep."
