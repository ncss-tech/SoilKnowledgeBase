  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the loamy till or lacustrine sediments ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the upper material and 0 to 10 percent in the underlying loamy till or lacustrine sediments.\nThe O horizon is typically muck, but subhorizons of mucky peat are not excluded. The O horizon rubbed has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Fiber is typically herbaceous, but up to 15 percent may be woody. It is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or is neutral. It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam, or the mucky analogues of these textures. It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. It is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a Cg horizon in the sandy sediments.\nThe 2BCkg or 2Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. It Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. It is stratified or varved in the lacustrine sediments. Some pedons do not have 2BCkg horizons. Some pedons have 2Bg or 2Cg horizons with properties similar to the 2BCkg horizon.\nThe 2BCkg or 2Cg horizon in the Percy till phase has textures of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam. It has 12 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.75 to 2.00 g/cc.\nThe 2BCkg or 2Cg horizon in the Des Moines till phase has textures of loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. It has 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.35 to 1.60 g/cc.\nWhere formed in silty calcareous glacial lacustrine sediments, the 2BCkg or 2Cg horizon is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. Sediments may be finely stratified or laminated with clay. Total clay averages less than 35 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Northwood soils are in shallow depressions and drainageways on lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. These soils formed in a thin organic layer and sandy and loamy sediments, and the underlying till or lacustrine sediments. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 28 inches. Frost-free days range from 88 to 140. Elevation above sea level ranges from\n785 to 1350 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Berner, Grygla and Markey series. Grygla soils do not have a Histic epipedon and occupy higher areas. Berner and Markey soils have thicker organic layers and are in deeper depressions. These are the poorly drained Grygla, Chilgren, Kratka, Roliss, Smiley and Strathcona soils that are on the adjacent mineral uplands, and the very poorly drained Cathro, Berner, Hamre, Markey soils in adjacent peatlands. Cathro, Berner and Markey soils have thicker organic layers.  Hamre soils do not have a sandy sediment between the organic material and underlying loamy material."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Very poorly drained. The permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the upper organic layer, rapid in the sandy layers and moderate or moderately slow in the underlying loamy material. Surface runoff is very low or ponded. Depth to seasonal high saturation is at the surface at periods from November to July in normal years.  In addition, ponding may occur during periods of snow melt and high rainfall events."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the areas of Northwood soils are uncultivated. Native vegetation consists of alder, sedges, cattails, phragmites, or willow. When adequately drained, it is used for the production of hay, pasture, small grain, and sunflowers. Some areas are wooded with tamarack, black spruce,\nblack ash and northern white cedar."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: histic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (Oa horizon); aquic moisture regime. The accumulations of carbonates in the 2BCkg may be inherent to the till and not related to pedogenesis. Further field examination should be made to determine if the horizon is a 2BCkg or\na 2Cg horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
