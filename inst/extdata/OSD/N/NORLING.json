The soil is usually moist but is dry between 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer.  The particle- size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent rock fragments.  The soils have an ochric epipedon or an umbric epipedon less than 10 inches thick.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 50 percent gravel and cobbles.  It is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  The fine earth fraction is clay loam or loam.

All of the above series are over 40 inches to bedrock except for Cle Elum, Crozier, Hotaw, Speaker, and Wohly. Cle Elum soils have an albic horizon and are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  Crozier and Wohly soils have a lithic contact. Hotaw soils are dry for 120 to 150 consecutive days.  Speaker soils are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Norling soils are on hill slopes and mountain side slopes.  Elevation ranges from 400 to 4,000 feet.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from metavolcanics and metasediments.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and warm to hot, dry summers.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 35 to 60 inches but may range to 100 inches in high winter rainfall interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon.  The frost-free period is about 100 to 200 days."

Atring and Kanid soils are loamy-skeletal.  Sharpshooter soils lack an argillic horizon.  Dumont and Zing soils are fine textured. Vermisa soils are less than 20 inches deep.  All of these soils occur on broad ridgetops, foot slopes, or side slopes of mountains"
