  "OVERVIEW": "The Negley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and the underlying stratified outwash deposits. These soils are on outwash terraces, kames, eskers, and kame terraces. Slope ranges from 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",

The underlying substratum material is calcareous stratified sand and gravelly sand. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1092 mm (37 to 43 inches).

The more silty Alford soils are on nearly level or gently sloping areas of high terraces and loess hills. The Cincinnati soils and the moderately well drained Rossmoyne soils have slower saturated hydraulic conductivity and are on till plains. Fox soils are shallower to calcareous stratified sand and gravelly sand and occur in a complex pattern with Negley soils in some steep, eroded areas. The moderately well drained Haubstadt and Otwell soils have slower saturated hydraulic conductivity and are mainly on dissected lake plains. The moderately well drained Medora soils have slower saturated hydraulic conductivity and are typically on summits and shoulders of eskers. The Parke soils are typically on summits and shoulders of dissected outwash plains and outwash terraces and have a thicker mantle of loess."
