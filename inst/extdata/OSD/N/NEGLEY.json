    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Britwater, Holstein, and Morven series. Britwater soils formed in alluvial sediments washed from cherty limestone or cherty dolomite uplands and occur in MLRAs 116A and 116B. Holstein soils formed in colluvium or residuum weathered from sandstone, limestone, and shale and occur in MLRAs 115B and 116A. Morven soils formed in colluvium and calcareous conglomerate residuum and occur in MLRA 148."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Negley soils are on outwash terraces, kames, eskers, and kame terraces considered to be of Illinoian age or of pre-Illinoian age. Slope gradient typically is 2 to 35 percent, but ranges to 70 percent. The soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and the underlying outwash material. The underlying substratum material is calcareous stratified sand and gravelly sand. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1092 mm (37 to 43 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alford, Cincinnati, Fox, Haubstadt, Medora, Otwell, Parke, and Rossmoyne soils. The more silty Alford soils are on nearly level or gently sloping areas of high terraces and loess hills. The Cincinnati soils and the moderately well drained Rossmoyne soils have slower saturated hydraulic conductivity and are on till plains. Fox soils are shallower to calcareous stratified sand and gravelly sand and occur in a complex pattern with Negley soils in some steep, eroded areas. The moderately well drained Haubstadt and Otwell soils have slower saturated hydraulic conductivity and are mainly on dissected lake plains. The moderately well drained Medora soils have slower saturated hydraulic conductivity and are typically on summits and shoulders of eskers. The Parke soils are typically on summits and shoulders of dissected outwash plains and outwash terraces and have a thicker mantle of loess."
