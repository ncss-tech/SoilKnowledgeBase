  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Nemote soils are usually moist but they are dry in the upper part of the soil pedon during the months of July and August and sometimes during parts of June and September as well as for short periods in late April and early May.  They have mean annual soil temperatures ranging from 44 to 46 degrees F. and average summer soil temperatures ranging from 60 to 64 degrees F.  The entire soil is very gravelly with percentages of angular gravel ranging from 40 to 80 percent.  It is very gravelly sandy loam to very gravelly loam in the A1 horizon and very gravelly loamy fine sand to very gravelly sand in the A2 horizons with lamellae of loam or clay loam in the B horizon parts of the mixed A and B horizons.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR, value is 5 or 6, and chroma is 2 or 3 in the A1 horizon. Value is 6 or 7 and chroma is 1 or 2 in the A2 horizon and value is 5 or 6 and chroma is 3 or 4 in the lamellae."
