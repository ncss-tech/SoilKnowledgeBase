  "OVERVIEW": "The Norland series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rocks on fan terraces and dissected alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F",

(Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nC horizon - the zone from about 25 inches to 60 inches. (C1, C2 and C3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998\"."
