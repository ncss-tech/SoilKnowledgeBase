Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.  It is slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.

These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary rocks.  The climate is arid.  Average annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and the freeze-free period is 115 to 145 days."

(Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nC horizon - the zone from about 25 inches to 60 inches. (C1, C2 and C3 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eighth Edition, 1998\".\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
