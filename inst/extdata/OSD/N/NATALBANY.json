Reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid except where the surface has been limed.\nThe Eg horizon, where present has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.

Texture is silty clay or clay.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid. Iron accumulations are in shades of brown or olive and range from few to many. Clay films on surfaces of peds are very dark gray or dark gray.\nThe BCg and Cg horizons, have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5BG, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1, or they are neutral with value of 4 to 6.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Panola series in the same family, and the Alligator, Baldwin, Forestdale, Mahew, Midland, Sessum, Sharkey, and Wilson series in closely related families. Alligator and Sharkey soils do not have an argillic horizon. Baldwin soils have a loamy 2Cg horizon and are in a hyperthermic soil temperature regime. Forestdale soils have a loamy BC and C horizon. Mahew soils have shale fragments in the lower horizons and are underlain by soft shale. Midland soils have lower COLE values and do not form cracks during normal years. Panola and Wilson soils are dry for long periods, and form cracks that remain open for more than 90 days in normal years. Sessum soils do not have dark ped coatings in the upper Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Natalbany soils are on level to nearly level flood plains in drainageways that are adjacent to low lying backswamp areas. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. They formed in clayey deposits of Holocene Age or Late Pleistocene Age. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 64 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Abita, Barbary, Colyell, Encrow, and Springfield soils. The somewhat poorly drained Abita and Colyell soils are on higher convex ridges and are less clayey throughout. The very poorly drained Barbary soils are in lower lying backswamps and have fluid mineral layers. The poorly drained Encrow and Springfield soils are on level or nearly level interfluves on higher landscape positions. Encrow soils have a glossic horizon. Springfield soils have an abrupt textural change."
