  "OVERVIEW": "The Needleye series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that have a fragipan at a depth of 18 to 36 inches.  These soils of the upland formed in a thin mantle of loess over residuum from limestone.  Permeability is moderately slow above the fragipan and very slow in the fragipan.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",
