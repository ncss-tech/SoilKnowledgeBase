  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The A and upper B horizons contain less than 5 percent chert by volume.  The lower B horizon above the fragipan contains 0 to 20 percent chert by volume.  Chert content in the fragipan ranges from 20 to 70 percent and below the fragipan ranges from 10 and 50 percent.  The chert cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent above the fragipan and from 5 to 25 percent in and below the fragipan.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and in most pedons, a chroma of 2, but ranging to 4.  A horizons with values of 3 or less are 4 or less inches thick.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is neutral to very strongly acid.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles with value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less are present in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Lower Bt horizons above the fragipan have 10YR hue and value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, and have high chroma mottles.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and ranges to include gravelly silty clay loam just above the fragipan.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 2Btx horizon is mottled.  It is gravelly, very gravelly and extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay loam or silt loam.  A few distinct clay films, flows or plugs are common.  It is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nA 3Bt horizon is present in most pedons below the fragipan.  It commonly has hue of 2.5YR, but ranges to 10YR, with value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Distinct or prominent mottles are common.  It is gravelly or very gravelly  analogues of clay or silty clay and extremely acid to strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These gently sloping soils of the uplands are on the tops, terminal points, and side slopes near the crest of broad ridges.  Slope gradients are commonly 1 to 3 percent, but range from 0 to 5 percent.  The regolith consists of a thin mantle of loess over residuum from cherty limestone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bado, Viraton, and Wilderness soils.  Bado soils contain more clay in the argillic horizon and are on nearly level and depressional areas. Viraton soils are fine-loamy and Wilderness soils are loamy-skeletal. Viraton soils are on similar areas, and Wilderness soils are on steeper side slopes."
