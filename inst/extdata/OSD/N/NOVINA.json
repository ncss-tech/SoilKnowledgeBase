  "OVERVIEW": "The Novina series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils.  They formed in loamy and sandy alluvium on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 64 centimeters (25 inches) at the type location.",
