Redo soils lack Bw horizons, have mean annual soil temperature of 65 to 72 degrees, have Sonoran desert climate, and rock fragments are not dominated by quartzite. Shelley soils lack Bw horizons, and have rock fragments that are not dominated by quartzite. Tonopah soils lack Bw horizons, have mean annual soil temperature of 63 to 71 degrees and calcium carbonate equivalent of the Bk horizons is 10 to 40 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Niavi soils are on stream terraces and inset fans. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from quartzite with minor amounts of limestone, dolomite, shale and sandstone. Elevations are 3,000 to 4,700 feet. The climate is typical of the Mojave desert with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches; mean annual air temperature is 57 to 61 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 200 to 250 days."
