  "OVERVIEW": "The Niavi series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from quartzite with minor amounts of limestone, dolomite, shale and sandstone. Niavi soils are on stream terraces and inset fans. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
