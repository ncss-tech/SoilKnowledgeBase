  "OVERVIEW": "The Nutras series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from basalt and other igneous rocks.  Nutras soils are on mountain slopes, alluvial fans and valley side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
