    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Boston, Chalfont, Gudgel, Haubstadt, Pierpont, Plumfield, Robbs, Sciotoville and Shakamak series. Boston soils have limestone rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Chalfont, Gudgel, Pierpont, Robbs, and Sciotoville soils are less than 203 cm (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Haubstadt soils compete very closely, but they are on water deposited landforms, and typically have horizons with less than 50 percent silt in the 2Bt and 2Btx horizons. Plumfield soils are less than 61 cm (24 inches) to the top of the fragipan. Shakamak soils average less than 10 percent sand in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nabb soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes of loess-covered till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Nabb soils formed in 152 to 229 cm (60 to 90 inches) of loess and the underlying paleosol in Illinoian age till. The upper 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of the loess averages from 10 to 18 percent sand, and the lower part averages from 18 to 25 percent. The lower loess has been called \"gritty loess\". Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 160 to 190 days. Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Avonburg, Blocher, Bonnell, Cincinnati, Cobbsfork, Hickory and Jennings soils. The somewhat poorly drained Avonburg soils and the poorly drained Cobbsfork soils are on nearly level summits and flats. The well drained Bonnell and Hickory soils are on more sloping shoulders and backslopes. The moderately well drained Blocher soils and the well drained Cincinnati soils do not have iron depletions in the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic horizon. The moderately well drained Jennings soils have the lower part of the solum formed in residuum from black shale bedrock. Blocher soils are on shoulders and backslopes. Cincinnati and Jennings soils are on similar landform positions as the Nabb soils, but typically are on lower lying backslopes."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 61 cm (1.5 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the fragipan and low to moderately high in the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow in the fragipan."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Nabb soils are correlated in lieu of the Rossmoyne soils as subset surveys are updated in Indiana, because the depth to till is more than 102 cm (40 inches) which is outside the Rossmoyne series concept. In addition, Rossmoyne soils have a higher CEC activity class.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 18 cm (7 inches) (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: 33 to 203 cm (13 to 80 inches) (Bt, Bt/EB, 2Btx/Bt, 2Btx, 3Btb horizons).\nFragipan: 84 to 180 cm (33 to 71 inches) (2Btx/Bt, 2Btx horizons).\nRedoximorphic features: present in all horizons between 33 and 203 cm (13 and 80 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data: Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University, Station Bulletin No. 174, File No. JE7004; Station Bulletin No. 222, File No. JF7601; Station Bulletin No. 274, File No. RI7807; Station Bulletin No. 412, File No. JN8009; Station Bulletin No. 451, File No.'s FR8108 and\nSW8107.
