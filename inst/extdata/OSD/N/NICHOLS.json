The well drained Boyer soils are on nearby outwash plains where there is less silt and more sand in the subsoil. The moderately well drained Grays soils are on similar landscape positions where there is more clay and less silt in the subsoil. The somewhat poorly drained Shiocton soils are on slightly lower landscape positions. The poorly drained Keowns soils are on lower landscape positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches)(Ap); cambic horizon - 20 to 66 ccm (8 to 26 inches) (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3); oxyaquic feature - redox accumulations and saturation within 102 cm (40 inches).\nThis soil series was originally established in Outagamie County Wisconsin in 1975. It was later correlated in Calumet and Manitowoc Counties in 1976 and in Kewaunee County in 1977. The series was made inactive about 1987. The series site location was revisited in June 2006 and described to 80 inches. Since 11,292 acres in Outagamie County are moderately well drained and 9479 acres in the Calumet-Manitowoc survey are described as well drained and moderately well drained but have a moderately well drained TUD, the series concept is changed to moderately well drained (Oxyaquic) with this revision. A new series may be needed for 315 well drained acres in Kewaunee Co. and any well drained acres in Calumet and Manitowoc Counties.\nSince all of Calumet Kewaunee and Manitowoc counties are in the mesic temperature area and about 98% of Outagamie County (including all the acres of Nichols) is mesic, the temperature regime is changed to mesic in this revision.\nAdditional field and laboratory study is needed to verify the family texture and the presence or absence of an argillic horizon. About 2180 acres of similar soil on the same landform in Shawano County were correlated as coarse-loamy, argillic Salter Variant.\nAn additional 980 acres of this soil were correlated in Outagamie County as a clayey substratum phase. A new series may be needed for these acres.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
