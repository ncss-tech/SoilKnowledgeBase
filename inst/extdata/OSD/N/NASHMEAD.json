The soil, between a depth of 10 to 30 inches, is dry in all parts from June to October and is moist in all parts from December to May.  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 59 degrees F.  Organic matter to a depth of 10 inches is assumed to be greater than 1 percent.  Base saturation is 50 to 90 percent throughout the profile and less than 75 percent in some part of the top 30 inches.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; or 2.5Y 3/2.  It is gravelly sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/2 or 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4 or 5/4.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam, very cobbly loam and very cobbly sandy clay loam with 15 to 27 percent clay, 10 to 30 percent gravel and 10 to 35 percent cobbles.  Total volume of rock fragments ranges from 35 to 60 percent.\nThe BC or C horizon, when present, has a similar range in color, texture and total rock fragment content to the Bt.  It has weaker structure and fewer clay films."
