  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist and they are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between 4 and 12 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has granular or subangular blocky structure. It averages 20 to 27 percent clay. It is very strongly to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry; and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. It is extremely to very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It averages 20 to 25 percent clay. It has 0 to 30 percent soft gravel. It is extremely to very strongly acid."
