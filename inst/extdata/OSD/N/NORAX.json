These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 4 to 8 inches.  Clay content of the particle size control section ranges from 27 to 35 percent. Depth to accumulation of secondary carbonates ranges from 26 to 43 inches. Depth to weakly or moderately cemented duripan is 40 to 60 inches. There is 0 to 10 percent sand-size ash, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter and 5 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the particle size control section and in the profile above the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon chroma is 2 through 4 moist.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. It is a silty clay loam or clay loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Btk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist. Texture is a sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent is estimated to range from 5 to 15 percent.\nThe 3Bqm horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. Cementation is weak or moderate and the cementing agent is silica or silica and calcium carbonate. When crushed, the duripan textures to gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam, very gravelly silt loam, or very gravelly fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a 3Bkqm horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Norax soils are on knoll tops and shoulder slopes primarily with south and west aspects on uplands at elevations of 2,400 to 3,200 feet. Slopes are 3 to 30 percent. Norax soils formed primarily in pre-Wisconsin age loess with a small amount of volcanic ash. A minor component of post-Wisconsin age loess is incorporated within the surface horizon. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Average January temperature is about 26 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 70 F., and average annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 165 days."

McCue soils are on plateaus and have more than 35 percent clay in the control section."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 4 inches, an argillic horizon from 4 to 54 inches, a zone of secondary lime accumulation from 34 to 54 inches and a weakly cemented duripan from 54 to 60 inches. The particle size control section is the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon from 4 to 24 inches (the 2Bt1, 2Bt2, and part of the 2Bt3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial NSSL lab data is available on this pedon NSSL pedon number 89P0221. A sampling error was made in sampling the surface horizon at 0 to 3 inches instead of the more typical 0 to 4 inch thickness. A 4 to 8 inch thick Ap surface horizon is more representative of the Norax series overall.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
