  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Notchko soils occur on moderately broad ridges and upper slopes of mountains. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevations are 80 to 700 meters (260 to 2300 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from  weakly consolidated fluvial, beach, dune and estuarine deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1780 to 2290 millimeters (70 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 280 days."

Scaath soils are 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to a lithic contact.   The Scaath soils are on narrow spur ridges and convex slopes. The Wiregrass soils are alongside the Rockysaddle soils on colluvium of lower rock content."

Parasesquic mineralogy - There is 11 percent dithionite-extractable sesquioxides in the clay fraction of the particle-size control section\n6. Palehumult features - Clay remains at least 80 percent of its maximum to a depth of 178 centimeters\n7. CEC to clay ratio is 16 to 30 cmol/kg of clay in the major part of the argillic horizon\n8. Particle-size control section - the zone from 18 to 68 centimeters, averages 37 percent clay, and 3 percent rock fragments.\n9.
