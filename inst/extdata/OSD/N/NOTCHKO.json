  "OVERVIEW": "The Notchko series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial, beach, dune and estuarine deposits derived from mixed sources. Notchko soils are on mountains and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters (85 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
