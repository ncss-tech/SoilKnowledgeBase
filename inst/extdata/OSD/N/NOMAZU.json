    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nomazu soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans, alluvial plains, fan skirts, and basin floor remnants.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,365 to 1,750 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
