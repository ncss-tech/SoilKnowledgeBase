  "OVERVIEW": "The Nomazu series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  Nomazu soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans, alluvial plains, fan skirts, and basin floor remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
