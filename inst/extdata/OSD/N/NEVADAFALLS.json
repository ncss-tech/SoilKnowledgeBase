  "OVERVIEW": "The Nevadafalls series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium or till derived from granitoid rock. These soils are on moraines, ground moraines, mountain slopes, landslides, bedrock benches, stream terraces and ephemeral streams. Slope is 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches (1,041 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F (10.6 degrees C).",
