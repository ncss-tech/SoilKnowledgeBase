Mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist between depths of 13 and 50 inches and are dry in all parts only from late July until early October.  Texture is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam throughout the solum and is modified by rock fragments.  Rock fragments average 35 to 65 percent of the soil below a depth of 10 inches.  Typically pebbles, cobbles, stones and boulders are all present.  These soils have ochric epipedons with chromas of 4 or more either at the surface or within 3 to 9 inches of the surface.  Base saturation is less than 60 percent in all parts between 10 and 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4 or 7.5YR 3/2 or 4/2.
