  "OVERVIEW": "The Nephi series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from shale, limestone and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
