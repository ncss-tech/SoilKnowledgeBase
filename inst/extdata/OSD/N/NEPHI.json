The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 70 degrees F.\nThe mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick. The solum thickness is 24 to 42 inches.  Depth to the horizon of carbonate accumulation is 18 to 30 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It has 23 to 27 percent clay.  The Ap horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, chroma is 3 or 4.  It has 27 to 35 percent clay and has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The Btk horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Ck horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 or 5 dry and 4 through 6 moist.  It is a silt loam, loam or silty clay loam and is moderately to strongly alkaline."

Parleys, Parlo, Bingham and Timpanogos soils lack 5YR hue.  Parleys soils are also slightly acid or neutral in the A and B horizons.  Parlo soils have contrasting textures in the particle size control section.  Bingham soils have a gravelly argillic horizon.  Timpanogos soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section."
