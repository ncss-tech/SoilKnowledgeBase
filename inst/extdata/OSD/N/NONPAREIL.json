  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nonpareil series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone.  Nonpareil soils are on ridgetops, hillslopes and convex footslopes and have slopes ranging from 3 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist, but is dry throughout the control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent soft gravel sized fragments and 0 to 15 percent soft cobble sized fragments.  Most of these are weathered and crushable.  The maximum amounts commonly are on the steeper slopes.  The base saturation is less than 60 percent between the depth of 10 inches and to the paralithic contact.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, silty loam, or clay loam and averages 20 to 35 percent clay.  Clean sand and silt coatings are common in some pedons."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum wethered from sandstone and siltstone.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F., and the annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."

Oakland soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
