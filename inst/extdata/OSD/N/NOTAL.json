  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Hanksville (UT), Shear (UT) and Yuba (UT) series.  Hanksville soils are moderately deep to shale. Shear and Yuba soils are in the Great Basin Desert and are drier in the summer and more moist in the winter. In addition, Shear soils formed in eolian clays on wind deposited dunes and have very fine granular structure that gives the appearance and loose consistence of medium sand; Yuba soils have salic horizons and mean annual soil temperatures of 51 to 54 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Notal soils are on low stream terraces on valley floors and alluvial fans on valley sides, fan terraces, and small depressions of undulating plateaus. Notal soils formed in stratified alluvium, stream alluvium, and fan alluvium derived from Cretaceous and Tertiary shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Thin, locally derived deposits of eolian material are present in some areas. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."

Hamburn soils are fine-loamy and occur on flood plains. Jeddito soils are coarse-loamy and occur on low stream terraces. Razito soils are sandy and occur on stable dunes and fan terraces."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon  the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)\nEntisol feature - the lack of diagnostic horizons within 3 to 40 inches (Bw, BCy, and Cy horizons)\nThe By horizon does not qualify as a cambic horizon because it lacks consistently higher chroma, redder hue, or higher clay content than an underlying horizon, and also because of the lack of evidence of removal of calcium carbonates. Bk or Ck horizons are not present below the By horizon, probably due to the young age (Holocene) of the alluvial deposits these soils occur in.  Carbonates are present in the parent material and in the dust that falls on the soil.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nThe taxonomic classification was changed from Typic Camborthids to Typic Torriorthents in 1993.  Present classification represents the soil as mapped in the drier areas of San Juan County, New Mexico.  The upper end of the precipitation range has been restricted to 8 inches to better represent the Typic Aridic moisture regime as it occurs in northwest New Mexico.  Areas mapped as Notal in the Eastern Part of San Juan County, New Mexico, which have 8 to 10 inches of mean annual precipitation, are within the range of the established Lybrook series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: One pedon in San Juan County, NM was sampled for full characterization by the NSSL as pedon No. S86NM-045-9.\nSoil and Range Inventory Report of District 12; U.S.D.I., BIA, Shiprock Agency, 1978.  Soil profile #4506-1 is within the range of this series.\nSalinity values were determined on the type location and four additional pedons with a Wheatstone bridge or Instant EC salinity kit. SAR values are partially estimated.  Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined with a field volume calcimeter.\nUpdated and revised for the correlation of Ft. Defiance Area AZ715 2/08  DWD\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
