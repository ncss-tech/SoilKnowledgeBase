    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock are more than 60 inches.  The soils are dry between depths of 11 and 29 inches from May to late October and usually are moist all the rest of the year.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The clay content does not decrease by as much as 20 percent of the maximum within a depth of 60 inches from the soil surface.  The particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent gravel in the control section.  It is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/4; 2.5YR 3/4 or 3/6.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6, 5/8; 2.5YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/4, 4/6 or 5/6.  Moist color is 5YR 3/4, 4/4; 2.5YR 3/4, 3/6, 4/6 or 4/8. Chroma of greater than 4 is found in at least the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Both moist and dry colors with hues of 2.5YR only occur in the lower part of the argillic.  Some pedons have variegated colors.  It is very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay with 27 to 55 percent clay.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 55 percent."
