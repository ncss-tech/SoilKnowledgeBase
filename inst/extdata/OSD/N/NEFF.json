    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or silt loam and the clay content ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Reaction ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid, except where it has been limed and then it ranges to neutral.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Iron depletions and accumulations are in shades of gray or brown. Texture is loam or silt loam and the clay content ranges from 18 to 26 percent. Reaction ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray and brown. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam and the clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray, brown, or yellow. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam and the clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid. Sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in diameter make up 0 to 15 percent by volume."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Neff soils are on broad nearly level or very gently sloping flood plains in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in loamy alluvium. The climate is humid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 56 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 61 degrees to 64 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 64 to 76."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cupco, Dela, Kenn, Pocola, Rexor, and Speer series. Cupco and Pocola soils occur on slighty concave areas. Dela soils occur on similar landscapes closer to the stream channel, are coarse-loamy, and relatively younger. Kenn soils commonly occur upstream closer to the source of sediments, and are fine-loamy. Pocola soils have more than 35 percent clay content in the control section and aquic moisture regime. Rexor soils occur on slightly higher convex areas. Speer soils have a fine-loamy control section, are well drained, and occur on similar landscape positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Neff soils are moderately well drained. Runoff is slow, and permeability is moderately slow. A water table is at a depth of 0.5 to 2.5 feet in winter and spring. These soils are subject to occasional or frequent flooding for brief or very brief periods from November to June."
