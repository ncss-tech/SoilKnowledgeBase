  "OVERVIEW": "The Neff series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These nearly level or very gently sloping soils are on broad flood plains in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains, MLRA 119, and Arkansas Valley and Ridges, MLRA 118. They are saturated in winter and spring. Slope is dominantly less than 1 percent but ranges up to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 46 inches.",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cupco, Dela, Kenn, Pocola, Rexor, and Speer series. Cupco and Pocola soils occur on slighty concave areas. Dela soils occur on similar landscapes closer to the stream channel, are coarse-loamy, and relatively younger. Kenn soils commonly occur upstream closer to the source of sediments, and are fine-loamy. Pocola soils have more than 35 percent clay content in the control section and aquic moisture regime. Rexor soils occur on slightly higher convex areas. Speer soils have a fine-loamy control section, are well drained, and occur on similar landscape positions."
