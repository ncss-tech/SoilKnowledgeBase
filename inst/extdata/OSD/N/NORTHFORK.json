  "OVERVIEW": "The Northfork series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent in mountains and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
