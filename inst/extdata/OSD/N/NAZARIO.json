  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nazario series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, schist, and loess over residuum derived from granitic fanglomerate and sandstone.  Nazario soils are on narrow beveled summits and shoulders of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
