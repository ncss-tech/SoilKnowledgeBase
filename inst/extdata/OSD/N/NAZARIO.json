They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist and Quaternary loess over residuum derived from Tertiary granitic fanglomerate and sandstone.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
