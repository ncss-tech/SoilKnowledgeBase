  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 to 58 degrees F. without an O horizon. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick, the solum is 20 to 33 inches thick, depth to calcareous material is 6 to 23 inches, and depth to the limestone bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The content of organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .8 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with depth. The bulk calcium carbonate equivalent, including fine gravel less than 3 inches in diameter, is 6 to 30 percent in nearly all horizons. Content of coarse fragments is 35 to 70 percent, mostly limestone rock more than 10 inches in diameter but with some limestone gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 1 through 3. It usually has fine granular primary structure but is subangular blocky in some pedons. It is soft to slightly hard and neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and 3 or 4 moist, with chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has prismatic primary structure but is subangular blocky in some pedons. It is typically loam or light clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 25 to 55 percent, and sand from 20 to 50 percent, with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. It is neutral to slightly alkaline. Content of coarse fragments is 35 to 70 percent, mostly limestone rock more than 10 inches in diameter but with some limestone gravel.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR. Content of coarse fragments is 35 to 70 percent, mostly limestone rock more than 10 inches in diameter but with some limestone gravel. The Bk horizon contains 6 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction and the bulk equivalent, including fine gravel less than 3 inches in diameter, is 6 to 30 percent."

Fornor, Fourmile, Geertsen, Hodden, Hoodle, Lagarita, Libeg, Maciver, Norriston, Quander, Ratiopeak, Spanpeak and Teeler soils are more than 40 inches deep. Bowen and Woodhall soils lack consistent k horizons in the solum or above the bedrock. Nathale soils have less than 10 percent stones larger than 10 inches in diameter."

The soil formed in very stony medium textured parent material weathered residually from underlying limestone bedrock. Elevation is 8,500 feet or more. In more northerly latitudes in Wyoming, they are at elevations as low at 5,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer months. Mean annual temperature ranges from 33 to 44 degrees F., and mean summer temperature ranges from 44 to 58 degrees F."
