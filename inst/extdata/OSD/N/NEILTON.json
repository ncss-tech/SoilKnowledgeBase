These soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive following summer solstice.  The particle size control section is 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is less than 60 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  This horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure or it is massive or single grained.  It is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand, extremely cobbly sand, or extremely cobbly loamy sand.  This horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure or it is single grained.  It is moderately acid or strongly acid.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  This horizon is very gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly sand, extremely loamy sand, extremely cobbly sand, or extremely cobbly loamy sand.

Janile soils have granitic bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Snoqualmie and Wiseman soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and lack a color B horizon.  In addition, Wiseman soils are more than 35 percent phyllite channers in the particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches that averages 52 percent coarse fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Neilton soils are on glacial outwash terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in glacial outwash materials derived from granite, quartzite, shale, sandstone, schist, basalt, and andesite.  Neilton soils are at elevations ranging from sea level to 1,600 feet.  They have a mild climate with an average annual precipitation of 30 to 60 inches; cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  The average January temperature is 36 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 63 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 140 to 220 days."

Alderwood, Elwha, Harstine and McKenna soils have dense glacial till at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bellingham soils are fine and have an aquic moisture regime.  Caraco soils are fine-loamy.  Casey soils are fine and have an argillic horizon.  Everett soils have a spodic horizon.  Indianola soils are sandy."
