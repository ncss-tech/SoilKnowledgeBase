  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is 35 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 to 65 degrees F.  and usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil between depths of 4 to 12 inches is usually dry all of the time from May until late October or early November and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in the A and Bt1 horizons to over 50 percent in the Bt2 horizon.  Soil reaction is slightly acid to neutral in the A and Bt1 horizons and slightly acid to mildly alkaline in underlying horizons.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown, grayish brown and yellowish brown with hues of 10YR and 7.5YR.  Moist color values are 3.  The upper 1/2 to 2 inches has weak platy structure and the rest of the horizon is massive and hard when dry.  The texture is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam and gravelly clay loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon is yellowish brown, brown and strong brown with hues of 10YR and 7.5YR.  The texture is gravelly clay and sandy clay.\nThe Bt2 horizon has mixed yellowish brown, brown and reddish brown colors.  The sediments are stratified and the texture includes very gravelly or cobbly clay, gravelly clay or sandy clay loam."

Corning and Hillgate soils have moist values of 4 or more in the A horizon and Corning soils are medium or strongly acid in their Bt horizons.  Kimball soils have hues of 5YR in the upper part of the B2t horizon.  Milpitas, Positas and Tierra soils have A2 horizons.  Tierra soils have B2t horizons that are dark grayish brown or very dark grayish brown in the upper part."

They formed in gravelly alluvium from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and moist cool winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches.  Average January temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.; average July temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 280 days."
