  "OVERVIEW": "The Northway series are very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in outwash sands overlying loamy till. They are nearly level and gently sloping soils on glacial lake plains and adjacent uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 33 inches.",

Most lab data for Spodosols in the northeast supports changing mineralogy classes from mixed to Isotic.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 8 inches (Ap1 and Ap2\nhorizons).\n2) Spodic horizon - from 8 to 12 inches (Bs horizon)\n3) Epiaquods - redoximorphic features in the spodic\nhorizon within 20 inches of the mineral surface,\nperched water table.\n4) Redoximorphic features - accumulation of Fe oxides,\nand/or reduced matrices (all horizons below the\nAp)."
