  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is 18 to 40 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 80 inches. Redoximorphic features consisting of concentrations of Fe/Mn oxides, or Fe and clay depletions occur within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the solum and from 10 to 35 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an Oi or Oe horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Undisturbed A horizons have value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand in the fine earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon. It has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bhs horizon, if present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sand or sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 4 through 6. It has faint to prominent redox concentrations or depletions. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. It has faint to prominent redox concentrations or depletions. Texture is fine sand or sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak subangular blocky or it is single grain. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 through 3. It commonly has distinct or prominent redox concentrations or depletions. Texture is loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction and less commonly silt loam. Clay content averages less than 20 percent. Structure is weak or moderate platy or it is massive. Consistence is friable or firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe AuGres, Avoca, Battlefield, Pipestone, Rapson, Squamscott, and Wainola series are in related families. AuGres, Battlefield and Wainola soils are very deep sands lacking a contrasting family particle size classes, and have frigid temperature regimes. The Pipestone soils are also very deep sands. The Avoca soils have 20 percent or more clay in the 2C horizon. Rapson soils have stratified 2C horizons above 40 inches. The Squamscott soils have substrata with an average clay content ranging from 22 to 35 percent and less than 5 percent rock fragments."

They formed in outwash sands overlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 36 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean frost-free season ranges from 130 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 100 to 500 feet above sea level"

Most lab data for Spodosols in the northeast supports changing mineralogy classes from mixed to Isotic.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 8 inches (Ap1 and Ap2\nhorizons).\n2) Spodic horizon - from 8 to 12 inches (Bs horizon)\n3) Epiaquods - redoximorphic features in the spodic\nhorizon within 20 inches of the mineral surface,\nperched water table.\n4) Redoximorphic features - accumulation of Fe oxides,\nand/or reduced matrices (all horizons below the\nAp).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
