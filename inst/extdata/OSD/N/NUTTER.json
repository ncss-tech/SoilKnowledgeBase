These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary formations with high lime and gypsum content.  Elevation ranges from 4000 to 5000 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 180 days."
