  "OVERVIEW": "The Navan series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy outwash and in stratified mostly clayey and silty  stratified lacustrine deposits on glacial lake basins and low stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Barry, Brookston, Clackamas, Cordova, Jameston, and Navunon soils do not have fine stratification in the lower part of the series control section and have coarse fragments there. In addition, Brookston soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) deep to carbonates; Clackamas soils do not have carbonates within the series control section; and Navunon soils typically have a lithic contact within 152 cm (60 inches). Forestcity soils average less than 28 percent clay in the lower 1/3 of the series control section.  Hamel, and Nosoni soils have mollic epipedons more than 61 cm (24 inches) thick. Millgrove and Rensselaer soils have less than 20 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Radioville soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) deep to stratified lacustrine deposits. Tallmadge soils have a lithic contact at 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches).

The moderately well drained Hebron and the somewhat poorly drained Aztalan and Mosel soils form a drainage sequence with the Navan soils.  These soils are adjacent to and higher lying than the Navan soils.  Aztalan soils have mollic epipedons and Mosel soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Colwood soils formed in stratified silt and sand while Poy soils have finer textured horizons in the upper part of the solum.  Poy and Colwood soils occupy a similar setting as the Navan soils."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the lacustrine deposits. Permeability is moderate in the loamy outwash mantle and moderately slow in the lacustrine deposits.  In some places these soils are subject to common flooding. These soil have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 0 to 31 cm (0 to 1 foot) for long periods in most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\n7/04  This revision redefines the series concept to include only those soils formed in a loamy outwash mantle and the underlying stratified silty and clayey lacustrine deposits. A new typical pedon is used to better reflect this concept. Soils correlated as Navan that formed in loamy outwash and underlying clayey glacial till are excluded. This includes at least some of the acres in the Kenosha-Racine, Ozaukee, and Winnebago soil surveys and possibly some areas in other surveys. These areas should be correlated to another (new?) series when the surveys are updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon -  0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 inches) (Ap, A);  argillic horizon - 31 to 74 cm (12 to 29 inches) (Btg1, Btg2)  aquic feature - saturaton and redox accumulations in the lower part of the mollic epipedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
