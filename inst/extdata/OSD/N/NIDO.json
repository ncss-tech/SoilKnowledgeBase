  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nido series consists of very shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy residuum and colluvium weathered from sandstone. These very gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on dissected ridges. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm (21 in).",
