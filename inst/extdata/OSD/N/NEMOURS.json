    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 50 to more than 72 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the rest of the profile.  Few to common fine flakes of mica are in the B and C horizons of some pedons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, or it is neutral,\nvalue of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 3.  Where the value is less\nthan 3.5, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5\nto 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A and E horizon is fine sandy\nloam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma\nof 6 or 8, commonly with mottles in shades of red, brown, or\nyellow.  Some pedons are mottled in shades of red, brown, and\nyellow.  The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8,\nand chroma of 1 or 2, commonly with mottles in shades of red,\nbrown, yellow, gray, or it is mottled in shades of gray, red,\nbrown, or yellow.  The Bt and Btg horizon is clay or sandy clay.\nThe particle size control section averages 45 to 65 percent clay.\nThe BCg horizon has the same colors as the Btg horizon.  It is\nsandy clay, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma\nof 1 to 3.  It is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand."

Annemaine soils have a Bt horizon with Ca and Mg content averaging about 3 meg/100 gms.  Beason and Eulonia soils have less than 45 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Craven, Creedmoor, Dogue, Helena, Newco, Peawick, and Wolftever soils do not have colors in shades of red in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Lignum, Rosenwall, and Vinita soils have a solum less than 40 inches thick.  Sacul soils are underlain by shale and have a seasonal high water table at a depth greater than 6 feet.  Peawick soils have aluminum saturation greater than 50 percent.  Stapp soils have 15 to 30 percent fragments of shale in the B3 horizon.  Angie, Caroline, Dunbar, Duplin, Lenoir, Persanti,\nPooler, Shubuta, and Tiak soils have less than 20 percent clay decrease from the maximum within 60 inches of the surface.  Wahee soils have gray mottles throughout the argillic horizon."
