  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually dry and dry between 4 to 12 inches for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice and moist for 60 days or more following the winter solstice.  The solum is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The profiles lack coarse fragments but some pedons have desert pavement of pebbles on surface.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe upper part of the B horizon has value of 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is light clay loam or light silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe duripan usually has a root mat at the contact surface with some roots following fractures.  The top 1/2 inch is mostly silica with some thin streaks of calcium carbonates between lenses.  Carbonates predominate below the top 1 or 2 inches."

The soils are formed in lacustrine old lake materials with the surface reworked by wind.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 8 to 11 inches with hot dry summers and cold winters.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 to 45 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean winter temperature is 32 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 50 to 80 days."
