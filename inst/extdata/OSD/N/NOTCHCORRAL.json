  "OVERVIEW": "The Notchcorral series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash derived from dacite and residuum derived from basalt.  Notchcorral soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
