    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Notchcorral soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on summit positions.  These soils formed in volcanic ash derived from dacite and in residuum derived from basalt.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F., mean January temperature is 27 to 30 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
