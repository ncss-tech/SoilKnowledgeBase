    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nenno soils are on ground moraines and on footslopes and broad summits of drumlins. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in loamy till, typically with a thin loess mantle.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 890 mm (26 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 7.2 to 10.6 degrees C (45 to 51 degrees F)."

The well drained Hochheim soils form a drainage sequence with the somewhat poorly drained Nenno soils.  The Hochheim soils are on the more sloping relief.  Where the loess mantle thickens,  the well drained Theresa soils are on the steeper slopes in some areas and the moderately well drained Mayville and somewhat poorly drained Lamartine soils are on the gently sloping or depressional sites in some areas."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the surface and subsoil and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the surface and subsoil and moderately slow in the substratum.  These soil have a seasonal perched high water table at a depth of 31 to 76 cm (1 to 2.5 feet) for some time in most years."

Based on NSSL data for three pedons from series formed in the same till (one Hochheim pedon and two Theresa pedons) the concept of the till is changed to densic material (2Cd).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ap -  the thickness of the epipedon is more than 1/3 the thickness from the top of the epipedon to the base of the argillic horizon); argillic horizon - 25 to 53 cm (10 to 21 inches) (Bt1, Bt2); aquic feature  saturation and redox features within 41 cm (16 inches) of the soil surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
