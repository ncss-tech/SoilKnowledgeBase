  "OVERVIEW": "The Nabor series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium derived mainly from shale.  Nabor soils are on rolling hills and toeslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
