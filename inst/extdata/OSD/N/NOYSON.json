  "OVERVIEW": "The Noyson series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from rhyolite, andesite, and some granite.  Noyson soils are on fan piedmonts and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
