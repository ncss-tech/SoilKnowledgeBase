  "OVERVIEW": "The Navina series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 840 millimeters (33 inches).  Mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
