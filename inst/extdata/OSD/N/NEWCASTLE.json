  "OVERVIEW": "The Newcastle series consists of well drained, moderately permeable, moderately deep, loamy soils that formed in residuum from sandstone over sandstone bedrock.  These gently sloping soils are on uplands.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",
