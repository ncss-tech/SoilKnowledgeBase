  "OVERVIEW": "The Nilrap series consists of deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability.  They formed on relict alluvial fan piedmonts and terraces in medium textured alluvium over skeletal outwash from mixed sources.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",

Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 20 inches or more.  The Bk horizon contains 35 to 50 percent gravel and less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees F., and the mean annual summer temperature is 60 degrees F. or more.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is typically a silt loam but may be loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically a clay but may be a clay loam.  Clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent.

Texture is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam with 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments.  Lime occurs as segregated seams and soft masses.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 14 percent.  Reaction is mildly through moderately alkaline."

The average annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches with over half of the annual precipitation falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October.
