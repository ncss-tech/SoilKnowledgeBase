  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3; hue of 2.5YR, value of 2 to 5; or hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 to 6; hue of 2.5YR, value of 4; or hue of 10R, value of 4, and chroma of 6 to 8.  It is clay or sandy clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid to medium acid.  Olive or brownish mottles are common to many in some subhorizons.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has the same color range as the Bt horizon, or it is mottled in shades of brown, olive, gray, or red.  Glauconitic sand makes up about 20 to 40 percent.  The texture and reaction range is the same at the Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon is mottled in shades of brown, olive, gray, or red.  It is clay or sandy clay.  Reaction is medium acid to mildly alkaline.  Greenish glauconite sand is prominent throughout.  Calcium carbonate accumulations and carbonate concretions range from none to common in the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Natchitoches soils are on nearly level to sloping southern coastal plains.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 12 percent.  The soil formed from thick deposits of sediments high in glauconitic sand in the Cook Mountain Formation.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F, and the average annual rainfall is about 50 inches near the type location."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Natchitoches series is placed in the Hapludalfs great group rather than Paleudalfs, because the lower part of the pedon does not have red colors.  Also, the high content of clay in the C horizons is inherent to the parent material and not the result of clay movement.  Data is available in sample number 372LA-35-1 by the National Soil Survey Laboratory and ample number 374LA-69-1 by the Louisiana State University laboratory.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nArgillic horizon - the Bt horizon from 4 to 38 inches.\nVertic properties - has the necessary cracks, cole, and clay content for the subgroup.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU. S. A."
