  "OVERVIEW": "The Neah series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 85 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 110 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 47 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year (perudic).  Depth to bedrock and thickness of the umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with a weighted average of 5 to 35 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron 2 to 6 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 35 to 50 percent for air dried samples.  Acid oxalate iron is 2.0 to 3.5 percent.  It has 20 to 40 percent organic matter decreasing with depth.  It has 2 to 8 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry. Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 6 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.  It is gravelly medial silt loam, very cobbly medial silt loam, or gravelly medial loam.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid."
