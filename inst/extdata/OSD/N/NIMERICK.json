  "OVERVIEW": "The Nimerick series consist of moderately deep, well drained moderately permeable soils that formed in mixed material from basalt, limestone and sandstone.  These soils are on high plateaus and flat mountain tops, with slopes ranging from 1 to 25 percent.   The mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
