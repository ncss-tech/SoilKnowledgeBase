  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 30 to about 80 inches.  There are a few black concretions throughout most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  The reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral.\nTexture of the argillic horizon is clay or clay loam with clay content of 35 to 55 percent.  The B21t and B22t horizons are variable in color within a distance of a few feet and are mottled or have a matrix of reddish or brownish colors.  They have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 8.  Some mottles have hue of 2.5YR.  The lower B2t horizons are in shades of brown, gray, or yellow and are typically mottled with these or reddish colors.  The B21t and B22t horizons are medium acid through neutral.   The lower B2t horizons are neutral through moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are calcareous in the lower part.\nLower B3 and C horizons when encountered have brown, yellow or olive colors with or without grayish or reddish mottles.  They are clay or clay with strata or pockets of shaly clay.  Some pedons have shaly clay C horizons below a depth of 60 inches.  The reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline with few or common concretions and soft masses of calcium carbonate."

Axtell, Crockett, Crosstell, and Tabor soils have an abrupt texture change between the A and B2t horizons.  Bazette, Normangee and Steedman soils have sola less than 60 inches thick.  The Payne series have COLE of less than .07.  Ponder soils have a 20 percent decrease in clay content from the maximum within a depth of 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The mean annual temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 42 inches.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 52 to 64."
