  "OVERVIEW": "The Nakwasina series consists of shallow, poorly drained soils formed in glacial till overlying paralithic material consisting of dense compact till.  Nakwasina soils are on mountain and hill sideslopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is in excess of 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Weighted average particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 0 to 50 percent gravel, weighted average is than 35 percent.  Reactions increase with depth, ranging from extremely acid to slightly acid. An Oi horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is commonly silt loam or mucky silt loam but ranges to include sandy loam or mucky sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue from 2.5YR to 10YR, value from 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 40 percent gravel.  Mottles are commonly present.  A mottled BC horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has value from 3 to 5 and chroma from 2 to 4.  Texture is commonly sandy loam or loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 50 percent gravel.  Mottles may be present.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue from 2.5Y to 5GY, value from 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is commonly loam but ranges to include sandy clay loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 75 percent gravel.  Weak cementation is common.
