  "BYREV": "Rev. BDD-GLS-RJS",
  "REVDATE": "10/2008",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Niarada series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till, alluvium, colluvium and glacial drift.  These soils are on stream terraces, dissected alluvial fans, hills, and moraines.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
