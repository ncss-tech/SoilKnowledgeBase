  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 60 inches thick. Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in all horizons.  Total thickness of the A and E horizon is less than 30 inches.  Depth to argillic horizon ranges from 40 to 80 inches beneath the soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral and has value of 3 or 4.  Where value is 3, thickness is only 4 or 5 inches.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  In some pedons this horizon has a few mottles in shades of yellow or brown.  Texture of the E horizon is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma 1 to 4.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  The sand grains are well coated with organic matter.  The consistence of this horizon is usually very friable or friable.  It is non-cemented or only very weakly cemented.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4, or value of 3, chroma 4; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 4, with or without mottles in shades of brown or gray.  Texture is usually sand but range includes fine sand.  In some pedons this horizon is absent.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4, or value of 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Mottles of various shades of gray, yellow, and brown are common in some pedons.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe EB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or less with mottles in shades of gray, yellow, or brown or it is a mixture of these colors.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles of red, brown, and yellow are common. Some pedons have matrix color with chroma 3 or 4 with common to many red, brown, and gray mottles.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cassia, Electra, Narcoossee, Pomello, and Zolfo.  Cassia, Narcoossee, Pomello, and Zolfo soils do not have argillic horizons beneath the spodic horizon.  Electra soils have spodic horizons between depths of 30 and 50 inches.  In addition, Pomello soils have a spodic horizon at depths of more than 30 inches, and Zolfo soils have a spodic below a depth of 50 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Average annual precipitation ranges from about 50 to 60 inches and the average annual temperature is about 70 to 74 degrees F."

Adamsville, Millhopper, Sparr, and Tavares soils all lack spodic horizons.  In addition, Adamsville, Myakka, and Tavares soils do not have argillic horizons; and Millhopper and Tavares soils are better drained. Myakka and Pomona soils are poorly drained."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Slow runoff, permeability is rapid in the sandy horizons and slow in the loamy horizons.  The water table is at depths of 18 to 30 inches for 1 to 2 months and at depths of 30 to 60 inches for 2 to 5 months during most years.  It recedes to depths of more than 60 inches during drier periods."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Some areas of these soils are in tame pasture or in special crops.  Most areas remain in native vegetation consisting of slash and longleaf pine and scattered live and laurel oaks.  A few turkey or water oaks are in some areas.  The understory is chiefly huckleberry, blueberry, gallberry, running oak, brackenfern, bluestems, paspalums, pineland threeawn, sawpalmetto, greenbrier, lovegrass, and lopsided indiangrass."
