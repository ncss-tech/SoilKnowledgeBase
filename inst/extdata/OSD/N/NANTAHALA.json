    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 55 inches.  Depth to fractured, weathered bedrock (Cr horizon) is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches. The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed.  Content of mica flakes ranges from few to common throughout.  Content of rock fragments commonly ranges from 0 to 30 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  A horizons that have moist value of less than 3.5 are less than 6 inches thick.  The E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The A and E horizons are loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or the channery or flaggy analogues of these textures.\nThe Bt horizon, and the BA and BC horizons, where present, have hue of 2.5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The Bt horizon is clay loam, clay, silty clay loam, silty clay, or their channery or flaggy analogues.  The BA and BC horizons are loam, clay loam, silt loam, or the channery or flaggy analogues of these textures.\nThe C horizon, where present, is multicolored saprolite that is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or the channery or flaggy analogues of these textures.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is multicolored, weathered, and fractured metasedimentary rocks such as metasandstone.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Agnos, Boden, Braddock, Clifton, Gassville, Groseclose, Howell, Lodi, Monmouth, Muse, Pervina, Sequoia, Trappist, and Unison soils in the same family, and the Bradson, Evard, and Hayesville soils in closely related families.  Agnos and Gassville soils have more than 60 percent clay in the Bt horizon.  Boden soils contains fragments of sandstone.  Braddock and Unison soils are on footslopes, colluvial fans, and high terraces and contain waterworn rock fragments.  Clifton soil contains fragments of rocks high in ferromagnesium minerals.  Groseclose soil contains chert fragments, is slowly permeable, and has high shrink-swell potential. Howell and Muse soils range to hue yellower than 7.5YR.  Pervina soil has annual rainfall of 60 to 72 inches.  Sequoia soil has a Cr horizon of soft shale bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.  Trappist soil has bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.  Bradson soil forms in colluvium.  Hayesville soils contain less silt and has fragments of granite and gneiss.  Evard soil is fine-loamy.  Lodi soils are very deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nantahala soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping ridges and side slopes of intermountain hills of the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  Elevations range from about 1,200 to 2,400 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Nantahala soils formed in residuum weathered from low grade metasedimentary rocks primarily metasandstone and metagraywacke.  Mean annual air temperature is 56 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches near the type location.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches."

Common trees are southern red oak, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, white oak, black oak, and hickory with white pine, Virginia pine, pitch pine, and shortleaf pine.  The understory includes flowering dogwood, mountain laurel, sourwood, buffalo nut, blackgum, and red maple. Some areas are cleared and used for pasture and cropland.  The main crops are corn, burley tobacco, and hay."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included with the Evard and Hayesville series.  However, those soils formed in residuum weathered from high-grade metamorphic rock such as granite and gneiss.  Lab data shows this soil to be clayey (Bt1 horizon - 51 percent clay, CEC/100g of clay-36 meq) and mixed mineralogy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches.\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 10 to 32 inches below the surface.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nMLRA: 130B                 SIR: NC0182\nRevised 02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys, update associated series, geographic setting, MLRA clarification, etablished series\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
