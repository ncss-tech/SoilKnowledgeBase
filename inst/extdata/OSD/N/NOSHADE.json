  "OVERVIEW": "The Noshade series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitoid with limestone rocks. The Noshade soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 millimeters (6 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
