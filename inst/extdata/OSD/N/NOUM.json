  "OVERVIEW": "The Noum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from mixed sandy eolian deposits overlying gypsiferous eolian sands. These undulating soils are on dunes, interdunes, and fan piedmonts.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches (229 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F (18 degrees C).",
