The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the contact with the dense layer has andic soil properties with 35 to 70 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.
