  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the petrocalcic horizon ranges from 6 to 19 inches.  Depth to limestone bedrock is from 7 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to about 75 percent.  Total clay content ranges from 28 to 45 percent, with the silicate clay content ranging from 25 to 35 percent.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 25 to 40 percent in the fraction smaller than 2 cm.\nThe Bkm horizon extends into the cracks in the limestone.  It is white or very pale brown.\nThe R layer is whitish or yellowish limestone.  Some pedons contain thin layers of softer limestone or marl below 40 inches depth."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Pardo series in the same family.  Similar soils are Amistad, Boracho, Cho, Ector, Eola, Kavett, Kimbrough, Mereta, and Tarrant series.  Pardo soils are underlain by ignimbrite bedrock (welded tuff) and contain ignimbrite fragments in the control section.   Amistad, Cho, Ector and Eola soils have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section, and Cho soils also have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the A horizon.  Boracho soils do not have a lithic contact within 20 inches and are formed in unconsolidated beds of igneous gravel.  Kavett, Mereta, and Kimbrough soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Tarrant soils contain more silicate clay, and have smectitic mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

At the type location they are of the Lower Cretaceous, and the Segovia and Buda formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches. and mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 210 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 2,000 to 3,150 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 19 to 31."

Angelo, Nuvalde, Rioconcho, and Tobosa soils are deep soils that occur in valleys or concave areas.  Conger soils have an ochric epipedon.  Ector soils occur at lower elevations and grow significant amounts of trees and shrubs.  Kimbrough and Mereta soils occur on the hill and ridgetops above Noelke soils."
