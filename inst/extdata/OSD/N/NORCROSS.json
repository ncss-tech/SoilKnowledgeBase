    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1 and A2 horizons and part of the Bt1 horizon).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 50 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 25 cm (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons).\nDuripan - The zone from 50 to 79 cm (Bqm horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 79 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 50 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Volcanic glass content determined locally by optical grain counts using a polarizing petrographic microscope. The typical pedon for the series from the Gerber Block of the Fremont National Area and one pedon from Lake County, Oregon, Northern Part were sampled and glass was counted in upper horizons. Oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half oxalate extractable iron values are estimated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
