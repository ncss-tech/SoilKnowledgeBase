  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Navigon series consists of very shallow to shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand derived from Navajo sandstone.  Navigon soils are on scree slopes on structural benches.  Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees.",
