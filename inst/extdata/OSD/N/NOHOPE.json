  "OVERVIEW": "The Nohope series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Nohope soils are on floodplains, stream terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
