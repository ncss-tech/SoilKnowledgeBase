Mannixlee soils have Bw horizons and do not have free calcium carbonate within 152 cm.  Marshbrook soils have free calcium carbonate at depths below 100 cm.  Marshdale soils have sandy-skeletal material within depths of 100 to 150 cm and lack free calcium carbonate.  Nythar soils do not have free calcium carbonate within 150 cm.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nohope soils are on floodplains. They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,600 to 1,955 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 80 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 50 cm (very shallow or shallow free water occurrence classes) sometime between December and June. Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent. Some areas of these soils are susceptible to very rare to occasional flooding for extremely brief to brief periods between February and June."
