These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for 100 to 120 days after the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 5 to 15 percent rock fragments by volume.  The mollic epipedon is more than 25 inches thick.  Depth to the 2Bt discontinuity ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Depth to the secondary lime ranges from 24 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.

Crookston soils have a fine sandy loam Bk horizon and are dry 60 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Newell soils lack a lithologic discontinuity in the argillic horizon and are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Peola soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Raldridge soils have 15 to 40 percent rock fragments and do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  Ralock soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments and lack a lithologic discontinuity in the argillic horizon.  Roystone soils are dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Slickpoo soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 55 inches and are dry for less than 100 days after the summer solstice."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Niben soils are on hillslopes, shoulders, footslopes and plateaus and have slopes of 3 to 30 percent.  They formed in interbedded sediments and slope alluvium with additions of loess.  Elevations are 1,800 to 2,900 feet.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches.  These soils receive extra moisture as runoff from shallow soils above and from moisture moving through the interbeds in the basalt.  The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is about 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 130 to 170 days."
