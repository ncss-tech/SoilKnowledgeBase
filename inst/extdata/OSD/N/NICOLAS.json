  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 17 degrees C (62.6 degrees F), and the difference between the mean summer and the mean winter soil temperature is less than 5 degrees C (9 degrees F).  The soil temperature is always above 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).  The soil between the depths of 38 to 89 centimeters (15 to 35 inches) is moist in all parts sometime in January to March about 60 to 75 days and is dry in all parts from about May or June to November.  The moisture regime is ustic bordering aridic.  The soils are calcareous and moderately alkaline throughout.  The calcium carbonates in the C horizon are the cementing agent giving the soil a slightly hard consistence.  Electrical conductivity is less than 4.0 and ESP ranges from 5 to 15.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, or 7/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, or 5/4.  It is sand or loamy sand.  Gravel content is 0 to about 5 percent.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, or 7/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, or 5/4.  It is sand or loamy sand.  Very coarse sand and coarse sand combined is less than 25 percent.  Ferruginous nodules range from 0 to 10 percent. ESP is 5 to 15 percent.\nAn overwash phase is also recognized in this series and is 10YR 6/2 or 6/3 sandy loam, about 13 to 36 centimeters (5 to 14 inches) thick.  The overwash soil material is the result of accelerated erosion from the steeper slopes."
