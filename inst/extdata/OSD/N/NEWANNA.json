The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F; the mean annual summer soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. In areas not disturbed by logging, an 0 horizon is typical. Depth to basalt and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The particle-size control section averages 10 to 25 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent rock fragments. It has phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, 2.0 to 15 cmol (+)/kg of KCl extractable aluminum, and 15-bar moisture of 20 to 30 percent based on an air-dried sample.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10 YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is 10 to 25 percent clay, 15 to 40 percent gravel, and 0 to 25 percent cobbles. A few stones are scattered over the surface, some are boulder size. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid. It has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is very cobbly medial loam, very gravelly medial loam, or extemely cobbly medial loam. It is 10 to 25 percent clay, 5 to 50 percent gravel, 10 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid. It has a moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.85g/cubic centimeter.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. It is 10 to 20 percent clay. Texture is very stony medial loam, very cobbly medial loam, very gravelly medial loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam It has 5 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 55 percent stones. Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid. It has a moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.85g/cubic centimeter."

In addition, Lilliwaup soils have an ochric epipedon. Brokenfinger soils lack an umbric epipedon.

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt and other volcanic rocks. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 150 inches. The average January temperature is 30 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 58 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 10 to 100 days."

Further investigation is needed to determine if the ferrigydritic mineralogy class is the same in both the Coast Range and Cascade Range mountains. Lab data seem to indicate that the Coast Range soils contain more than 2 cmol (+)/kg of KCl extractable aluminum while the Cascade Range soils have less than 2 cmol.\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
