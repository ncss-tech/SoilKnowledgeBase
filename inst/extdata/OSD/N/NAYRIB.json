  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nayrib series consists of very shallow, well drained soils on pressure ridges of basalt plains.  These soils have formed in eolian deposits from mixed sources.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
