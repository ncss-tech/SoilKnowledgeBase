These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days or more following summer solstice. Depth to a perched water table is 20 to 36 inches.  Saturated conditions are estimated to last for 30 or more cumulative days from January through March. The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 [SW3]grams per cubic centimeter, volcanic glass content of 7 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent (air dried sample). The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 55 percent sand coarser than very fine sand, and 0 to 10 percent unweathered rock fragments. Depth to the Btx horizon is 25 to 40 inches. Base saturation is assumed to be less than 75 percent in the Bt horizon. The solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.[SW4]\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 to 3, dry or moist. Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.[SW5]\nThe E and E part of the E/Bt horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist. Texture of the E horizon is ashy loam or ashy silt lo[SW6]am. Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe Bt part of the E/Bt horizon has a value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4, dry or moist. Texture is clay loam, silt loam, loam, or sandy loam[SW7]. Reaction is neutral to [SW8]moderately acid.\nThe Bt and Btx horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 6, dry or moist. Texture is clay loam, gravelly clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, or sandy clay [SW9]loam below the upper 20 inches. Fragic properties are estimated to make up less than 30 percent by volume.  Reaction is neutral to strongly acid."

Nard soils formed in residuum and colluvium from Roslyn and Swauk sandstone and old alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the surface. Elevations are 1,400 to 4,500 feet. The soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 40 inches. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 145 to 175 days"

Ampad soils are coarse-loamy and 20 to 40 inches to soft sandstone and located on cuestas and back slopes. Blag, Blewett and Brisky soils have lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches and are on mountain side slopes and ridges. Cle Elum soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and are on foothills and mountain side slopes. Kafing soils lack an argillic horizon, have a solum thickness of 22 to 32 inches, and are on mountain side slopes. Shaser and Standup soils are loamy-skeletal and are on mountain side slopes."
