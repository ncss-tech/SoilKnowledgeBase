  "OVERVIEW": "The Nard series consists of deep [SW1]and very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone and old alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the surface. Nard soils are on foothills, dipslopes and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
