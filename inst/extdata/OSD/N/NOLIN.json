  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 40 or more inches.  Thickness of alluvial deposits ranges from 60 inches to many feet.  Coarse fragments, mostly rounded pebbles, ranges from none to about 5 percent in the A and Bw horizon and from 0 to 35 percent in the C horizon.  Redoximorphic features, if present, are below 72 inches.   Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline, but some pedons are strongly acid in the lower part of the Bw and C horizon.  Some pedons have buried A or B horizons below a depth of 20 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, the range also includes stratified layers of these or their gravelly or cobbly analogs."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Jamesfin, Kinnick, Moshannon, and Ray series in the same family.  Jamesfin soils are close competitors and better differentiation is needed between these two series.  Kinnick soils have redox depletions indicative of a seasonal water table between depths of 3 to 6 feet.  Moshannon soils have B horizons with hues redder than 7.5YR, otherwise they are very close competitors.  Ray soils have sola less than 40 inches thick and have evidence of stratification above 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Nolin soils are on nearly level flood plains, in concave depressions, or on natural levees of major rivers and streams.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, siltstone, shale, and loess.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 48 to 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 38 to 50 inches."

Lindside soils are moderately well drained and have low chroma redoximorphic features within 24 inches.  Boonesboro soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Dunning, Melvin, and Newark soils have low chroma redoximorphic features at or within 20 inches of the surface.  Grigsby soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Sensabaugh soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Skidmore soils are in a loamy-skeletal particle size class.  The remaining associated soils are on stream terraces or on uplands and have argillic horizons."

Permeability is moderate.  Depth to a seasonal water table is greater than 6 feet.  The soil is subject to rare to frequent flooding or ponding in depressions for variable duration."

Forested areas are bottomland hardwoods, such as river birch, yellow-poplar, sycamore, elm, willow, boxelder, oak, hickory, and red maple.  Many stream banks and narrow flood plains consist of native canebrakes."
