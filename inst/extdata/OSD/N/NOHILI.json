  "OVERVIEW": "The Nohili series consists of poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium underlain by marly lagoon deposits and marine clays.  Nohili soils are on coastal plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F.",
