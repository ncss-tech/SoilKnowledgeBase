  "STATES": "VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Newmarc series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on flood plains. They formed in alluvium derived from limestones, sandstones, siltstones, and shales. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 55 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

Alonzville, Botetourt, Caverns, Coursey, Ingledove, and Shottower soils have argillic horizons and are on stream terraces. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are less than 60 inches to bedrock, contain more rock fragments in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Broadway, Gladehill, Gullion, Irongate, Nomberville, and Wolfgap soils are better drained and are on similar landscapes. Derroc soils contain more rock fragments in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Frederick and Groseclose soils, are well drained, contain more clay in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Moomaw soils have a fragipan and are on stream terraces."
