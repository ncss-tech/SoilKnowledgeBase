Alonzville, Botetourt, Caverns, Coursey, Ingledove, and Shottower soils have argillic horizons and are on stream terraces. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are less than 60 inches to bedrock, contain more rock fragments in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Broadway, Gladehill, Gullion, Irongate, Nomberville, and Wolfgap soils are better drained and are on similar landscapes. Derroc soils contain more rock fragments in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Frederick and Groseclose soils, are well drained, contain more clay in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Moomaw soils have a fragipan and are on stream terraces."
