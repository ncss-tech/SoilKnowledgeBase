Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has moist color of 10YR 3/2, of 7.5YR 4/6, of 5YR 3/4 or 3/3, or of 2.5YR 3/4, 4/4, or 4/6.  It has an apparent field texture of loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and is gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly.  It is 30 to 75 percent pebble-size iron and gibbsite concretions.  It is as much as 10 percent cobble-size concretions in some pedons.  Reaction in 1:1 water ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nA B1 horizon in some pedons has moist color of 7.5YR 4/4 or 4/6.\nThe B2 horizon has moist color of 10R 4/6, of 2.5YR 3/6 or 4/6, of 5YR 4/6, or of 7.5YR 4/6 or 5/6.  The apparent field texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.  The amount of clay, as measured by the product of 2.5 times the 15-bar water percentage, is more than 75 percent.  The horizon is 2 to 15 percent pebble-sized ferritic and gibbsitic concretions.  Reaction in 1:1 water ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.  CEC is less than 12 meq/100 grams of clay.  Aluminum extractable in 1N NH4C1 is less than 1.5 meq/100 grams of clay in some subhorizons.  Aluminum saturation (NH4OAc/CK1) ranges from 50 to 90 percent.\nThe C horizon has moist color of 10R 3/3, 3/6, 4/4, 4/6, or 4/8, of 2.5YR 4/6, of 5YR 4/6, of 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6, or 6/0, or of 10YR 3/6, 4/4, or 4/6.  The apparent field texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Pebble-size ferritic and gibbsitic concretions range from 2 to 15 percent by volume.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ngardmau soils are primarily on convex ridges and other erosional surfaces of hills and low mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in highly weathered saprolitic volcanic breccia and, less commonly, tuff.  They support a degraded anthropic savannah vegetation.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 689 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 81 degrees F. and does not vary by more than 34 degrees F from month to month.  Mean annual maximum temperature is 88 degrees F. and mean annual minimum temperature is 75 degrees F.  Mean annual rainfall is 145 inches and varies from 130 to 183 inches from year to year, with the driest months of February, March, and April averaging 7 to 9 inches per month."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Aimeliik, Babelthuap, and Palau soils.  Aimeliik and Palau soils also have a higher organic-matter content, CEC, fertility, and lack the high content of concretions.  They are under forest and anthropic savannah that exhibits good stands of grasses and forbs.  Babelthuap soils are on similar topographic positions to Ngardmau soils but are 20 to 39 inches deep to a saprolitic C horizon."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Ngardmau soils have a perudic moisture regime.  The surface layer becomes dry for short periods, particularly during the months of February, March, and April, due to the high coarse fragment content.  The mean annual soil temperature is 82 degrees F.  In local pronunciation of the word Ngardmau, the \"g\" is silent.  This soil meets all the requirements at an oxic horizon except thickness.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
