  "OVERVIEW": "The Nanuku series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy material from `a`a lava and basic volcanic ash.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 360 millimeters (14 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 28 degrees C (82 degrees F).",

These soils are on all hillslope positions of undulating to hilly `a`a lava flows that are 3,000 to 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in sandy material from `a`a lava and basic volcanic ash.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 180 to 510 millimeters (7 to 20 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2030 to 2540 millimeters (80 to 100 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 24 to 30 degrees C (76 to 86 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
