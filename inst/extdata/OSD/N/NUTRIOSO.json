  "OVERVIEW": "The Nutreeah series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in recent alluvium from mixed sources, principally tuff and basalt on flood plains and alluvial fans. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nutrioso soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping flood plains and alluvial fans. The soils are forming in recent alluvium from mixed sources, principally basic tuff and basalt with influence from old alluvium. These soils occur at elevations of 6900 to 8000 feet in a continental climate. The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 22 inches. About 62 percent of the precipitation occurs during July, August and September, with some occurring every month of the year. The mean annual temperatures range from 43 degrees F. to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 110 days."

Bushvalley soils are shallow to bedrock and members of a loamy-skeletal family. The Fruitland soils are moderately coarse-textured in the control section and are calcareous throughout. Shay soils are somewhat poorly-drained, fine-textured and in a mesic temperature class."
