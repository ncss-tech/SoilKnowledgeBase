They formed in colluvium from igneous and highly metamorphosed rock such as granite and rhyolite.  It is at elevations of 4400 feet or more on warm aspects, and 4000 feet or more on cool aspects.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 60 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Nopan series was proposed in the Mt. Rogers National Recreation Area for a special project. It appears on the legend for that area. It was used on the legend for the Grayson County Soil Survey Area. The 8/2000 revision updates this series to the 8th edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. The CEC activity class is estimated from other series that are somewhat similar and have lab data.\nThe 11/2005 revision adds index surface runoff class and other minor changes. The 7/2013 revision updates the series status and Series Established section.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon-0 to 6 inches (A horizon)\nb. Cambic horizon-from 6 to 50 inches (Bg and Bh horizons)\nc. Gleyed feature of the Bg horizons\nd. Indications of accumulation of illuvial, amorphous, dispersible organic matter sesquioxides-from 33 to 50 inches (Bh horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: There are no known data available. Transect data are available from the Grayson County SS Area.\nMLRA = 130\nRevised: 6/19/95-MHC; 8/2000-DHK; 11/2005-DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
