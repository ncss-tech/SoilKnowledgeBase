  "OVERVIEW": "The Nebel series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on base slopes of closed depressions in the Central High Tableland (MLRA 72). Mean annual precipitation is 48 centimeters (19 inches), and mean annual temperature is 12 C degrees (54 degrees F).",
