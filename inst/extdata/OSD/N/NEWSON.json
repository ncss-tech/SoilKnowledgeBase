  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness in the following paragraph is measured from the top of the mineral soil.) depth to the base of soil development typically ranges from 20 to 30 inches, but it ranges to 50 inches in some pedons.  The particle-size control section averages less than 50 percent fine sand and typically averages less than 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  Coarse fragments are absent in most pedons but in some pedons, volume of gravel ranges up to 35 percent in individual subhorizons.  Reaction naturally ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.  Redox accumulations are in the A horizon in some pedons.  Redox accumulations are typically throughout the solum below the A horizon and are in the substratum in some pedons. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less commonly dominate the matrix below the A horizon, but the C horizon in many pedons is the color of the uncoated sand grains.\nSome pedons have an O horizon of muck or mucky peat as much as 7 inches thick. It has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  Some pedons that have O horizons do not have A horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3.  Some pedons with a mucky surface have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR. Texture of the A or Ap horizon is loamy sand, mucky loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. When the upper 6 inches are mixed, the color value moist is 3 or less and color value dry is 5 or less (crushed and smoothed).\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand or the gravelly analogs.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or coarse sand\nThe Cg or C horizon typically has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6, but some pedons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the C horizon above a depth of 40 inches.  In many pedons the color of the C horizon is that of the uncoated sand grains. Texture of the Cg or C horizon is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand or the gravelly analogs."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occupy flats, depressions and drainageways on outwash plains, lake terraces, stream terraces and valley trains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Newson soils formed in very deep sandy outwash, sandy alluvium, or sandy lacustrine deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1950 feet."

The excessively drained Menahga, Omega, and Sartell soils; the moderately well drained Friendship soils; and the somewhat poorly drained Meehan and Nemadji soils form a drainage sequence with the Newson soils.  Dawson and Markey soils are in nearby areas where there is 16 to 51 inches of organic soil over sand."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas are in wetland vegetation consisting of grasses, sedges, reeds, and shrubs.  Some areas are in woodland.  Trees are of poor quality.  Common trees are quaking aspen, paper birch, jack pine and eastern white pine.  Some areas are used for pastureland and some areas have been drained and are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grains, and hay."
