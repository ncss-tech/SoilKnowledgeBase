Blackotter soils have a coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control section and an aquic moisture regime. Bear Lake and Lago soils are on smooth to concave slopes on the inside curves of the Bear River and on wider valley bottoms than Nuffer soils. Blackotter soils are next to Nuffer soils on lower terraces and in concave areas."
