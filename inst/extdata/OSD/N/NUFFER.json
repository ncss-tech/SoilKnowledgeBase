  "OVERVIEW": "The Nuffer series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium. They are on low terraces and slightly elevated areas on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part. Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
