  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments, mostly rounded pebbles, range from none to about 5 percent by volume to a depth of 30 inches, and commonly ranges from 5 to 15 percent below 30 inches, however the range allows 5 to 60 percent below 40 inches. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline throughout the profile. Manganese and iron concretions or nodules are few to many in all horizons. Presence of a C horizon is infrequent and not a requirement for the series.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have thin layers less than 7 inches thick with value of 3. Few to common redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, black, or gray.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional BA horizon with colors and textures similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe Bw has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The horizon has common to many redoximorphic features in shades of brown, black, red, or gray. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less, or has neutral color.  Few to many redoximorphic features are in shades of brown or red.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons can have a BCg horizon with colors and textures like those in the Bwg or Cg horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less, or has neutral color. Few to many redoximorphic features are in shades of brown or red.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam.\nThe C horizon, if present, is commonly in an evenly mottled pattern in hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Common to many redoximorphic features are in shades of gray, red, black, or brown.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have thin strata of loam, fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, or rarely silty clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aetna, Melvin, Petrolia, Rahm, Puget, Stanhope, Wayland, and Wick series. The Aetna soils formed in silty alluvium derived from glaciolacustine material. Rahm soils have buried horizons within a depth of 20 to 36 inches and are acid. Melvin, Petrolia, Stanhope, Wayland, and Wick soils are poorly or very poorly drained. Puget soils are poorly drained and have a western marine climate."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from limestone, shale, siltstone, sandstone, and loess.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 56.9 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 46.3 inches."

Other associated soils include the Otwood, Elk, Lawrence, Weinbach, and Wheeling series.  Ashton, Elk, and Wheeling soils are well drained soils on stream terraces and have argillic horizons.  Lawrence, Otwood, and Weinbach soils are on stream terraces and have a fragipan in the subsoil."
