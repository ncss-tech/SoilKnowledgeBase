  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly included in the Inez series.  This soil does not have an aquic moisture regime.  These soils were formerly classified as Aquertic Chromic Hapludalfs.  This classification was based on a preliminary analysis of soil moisture data collected on a similar soil.  Further analysis of these data indicate these soils do not have aquic conditions in the upper part in years of normal precipitation.  The gray matrix colors are considered a result of a much wetter climate or abnormally wet years. The vertic feature was dropped from the classification from these soils during 2019 due to lab tests showing low linear extensibility and no visible vertic soil features.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 33 cm (0 to 13 in) (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 33 to 203 cm (13 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, and Bt5 horizons).\nAdditional Comments: The series classification of mixed mineralogy is based on a mineralogy study on similar soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle-size anlaysis, salinity, and cation exchange capacity tests were performed at the project office on pedon S2019TX2854000.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
