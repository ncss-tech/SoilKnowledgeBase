  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crookston, Peola, Roystone and Slickpoo series.  Crookston soils are 20 to 28 inches to the secondary carbonates and have medium textured argillic horizons.  Peola soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Roystone soils are 18 to 30 inches deep to carbonates and have Btk horizons.  Slickpoo soils are cobbly in the lower part of the argillic horizon and have a lithologic discontinuity in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Newell soils are in level to moderately steep alluvial and colluvial fans and terraces at elevations of 2,000 to 4,000 feet. The slopes are mostly less than 10 percent and ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived chiefly from basaltic and other basic rock sources but containing some mixture of granite, rhyolite, and related material. The climate is semiarid and has relatively dry summers, a freeze-free period of 110 to 130 days, and a mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, including 3 to 6 feet of snowfall.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 51 degrees."
