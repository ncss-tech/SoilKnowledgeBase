  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nieman series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from fine grained sandstone or igneous bedrock.  These soils are on escarpments, ridges, strath terraces, structural benches, cuestas, hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
