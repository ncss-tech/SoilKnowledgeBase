  "OVERVIEW": "The Neissenberg series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and slope alluvium from basalt on plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is about 41 to 49 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following summer solstice. The natric horizon averages 35 to 45 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and SAR of 13 to 30. The mollic epipedon is 15 to 20 inches thick and includes part of the natric horizon.  A thin E horizon is in some pedons just above the natric horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has prismatic subangular or columnar structure.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It is silty clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bqk horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely cobbly loam or very cobbly loam.  The coarse fragments include 20 to 50 percent lime-silica cemented fragments or lime-silica coated basalt fragments."
