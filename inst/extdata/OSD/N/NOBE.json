  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nobe series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium from sedimentary beds.  They are on till plains, alluvial fans, floodplains, stream terraces, and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
