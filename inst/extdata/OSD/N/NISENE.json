The soil between depths of 6 and 17 inches is usually moist between the end of December and the end of April.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 56 to 58 degrees F.  Organic matter content is more than 1 percent at a depth of 22 to 34 inches.  Base saturation is more than 50 percent in all parts and less than 75 percent in some or all parts of the profile to a depth of 30 inches.  Pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon is very dark gray, very dark grayish brown, dark gray, dark grayish brown or grayish brown (10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 5/2).  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B2t horizon is dark brown, grayish brown, brown (10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2), and in places, at a depth greater than 20 inches, light brownish gray, light yellowish brown, or light brown (10YR 6/2, 6/4; 7.5YR 6/4).  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam and has 20 to 35 percent clay.  This horizon is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Some pedons have a B3t horizon that is yellowish brown or light yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 6/4) and is loam or sandy clay loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon, 5 to 10 inches thick, having a color of light yellowish brown or very pale brown (10YR 6/4, 7/4).  It is loam or sandy clay loam."
