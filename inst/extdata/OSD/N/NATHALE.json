The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 50 to 59 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  Content of rock fragments in the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent with 0 to 15 percent coarse pebbles, 25 to 50 percent angular cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones larger than 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam modified with 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Sand content is more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 25 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y; value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist; and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from interbedded limestone and sandstone, and slate.  Elevation is 5,500 to 9,500 feet.  Annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 34 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is less than 60 days."
