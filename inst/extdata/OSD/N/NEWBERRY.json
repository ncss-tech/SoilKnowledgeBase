    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Newberry soils are on broad summits or in shallow depressions on ground moraines.  They commonly have gradients less than 1 percent, but slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in 30 to 55 inches of loess and the underlying silty or loamy deposits (Roxana silts) that overlie a Sangamon age paleosol.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches, frost free days range from 180 to 200, and elevation ranges from 400 to 600 feet above mean sea level."

Cisne soils are on similar positions to Newberry, and average more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Ebbert soils have a mollic epipedon and are generally in adjacent or nearby deeper depressions.  The somewhat poorly drained Hoyleton soils and the moderately well drained Richview soils are on ridges above Newberry soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  With this update, the typical pedon site was moved and described to 80 inches to an area that captures the central concept of the series. The loess is presumed to be late Wisconsinan Peoria loess.  The underlying silty or loamy deposits are presumed to be early Wisconsinan Roxana silt. The underlying sediments contain more sand than the overlying loess, and in some pedons they include pebbles of the Illinoian diamicton concentrated by erosion.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 16inches (Ap and Eg horizons);\nalbic horizon - the zone from approximately 9 to 16 inches (Eg horizon);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 16 to 80 inches (BEtg, Btg1, Btg2, 2Btg3, 3Btgb1, and 3Btgb2 horizons);\naquic conditions - chroma of 1 or 2 and redox concentrations in all layers below the Ap horizon; a positive reaction to alpha-alpha dipyridyl is assumed.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
