  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  With this update, the typical pedon site was moved and described to 80 inches to an area that captures the central concept of the series. The loess is presumed to be late Wisconsinan Peoria loess.  The underlying silty or loamy deposits are presumed to be early Wisconsinan Roxana silt. The underlying sediments contain more sand than the overlying loess, and in some pedons they include pebbles of the Illinoian diamicton concentrated by erosion.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 16inches (Ap and Eg horizons);\nalbic horizon - the zone from approximately 9 to 16 inches (Eg horizon);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 16 to 80 inches (BEtg, Btg1, Btg2, 2Btg3, 3Btgb1, and 3Btgb2 horizons);\naquic conditions - chroma of 1 or 2 and redox concentrations in all layers below the Ap horizon; a positive reaction to alpha-alpha dipyridyl is assumed."
