These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches when soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to contrasting textures is 25 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is heavy loam, heavy silt loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  This horizon has moderate blocky or prismatic structure.  It has 15 to 50 percent sand coarser than very fine sand, 25 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry.  Texture is silt loam to fine sandy loam and has 5 to 35 percent coarse fragments.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and moist.  It is extremely gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand or extremely gravelly soils."

They occur in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  Average January temperature is 29 degrees F, average July temperature is 74 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 5l degrees F.  Frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
