Depth to contrasting textures is 25 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is heavy loam, heavy silt loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  This horizon has moderate blocky or prismatic structure.  It has 15 to 50 percent sand coarser than very fine sand, 25 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry.  Texture is silt loam to fine sandy loam and has 5 to 35 percent coarse fragments.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and moist.  It is extremely gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand or extremely gravelly soils."
