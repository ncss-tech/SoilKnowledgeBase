  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  This soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.  The amount of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent by volume throughout the profile.  The fragments consist mainly of soft to slightly hard micaceous shale and a few pieces of hard sandstone and limestone.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where disturbed, the A horizon has value of 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam or their channery analogues.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam or their channery or flaggy analogues.\nThe Cr horizon typically has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The colors are variable but seldom as red as the 7.5YR hue.  The shale is soft and micaceous and can be dug into with a hand spade. These shales have a high silt and very fine sand content."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Norris series is the only member in the family.  Other similar series are the Basehor, Bauer, Gosport, Mandeville, Montevallo, Roseland, and Snead series.  Basehor soils do not have shale fragments and have hard sandstone bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Bauer and Snead sols have mollic epipedons.  Gosport soils have fine textured sola.  Mandeville soils have argillic horizons and thicker sola.  Montevallo soils are loamy-skeletal and thermic.  Roseland soils have thicker sola and umbric epipedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed in loamy residuum from acid shale.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 42 inches."
