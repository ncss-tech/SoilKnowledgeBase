  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the recent silty alluvial sediments over the buried soil is 40 to 70 inches.  Depth to free carbonates is 70 inches or more.  The control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent of fine sand and coarser particles.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5YR hue, value of 3 or 4 with value 6 when dry, and chroma of 2.  It is silt loam or loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Cg horizon is stratified in color and texture.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and dominant value of 4 with a range of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 or 2 (see Remarks).  It has distinct or prominent mottles.  It is dominantly silt loam or loam but it has strata of very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, or very fine sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Ab horizon is loamy or silty.  Some pedons have buried organic layers that typically are sapric.  Both the mineral and organic layers are slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Limerick, Oridia, and Samish series in the same family and the similar Orion and Wakeland series.  Limerick soils are more acid and are in a more humid climate.  The Oridia series have B horizons and are in a more humid climate.  Samish soils have more than 40 percent talc in the upper part of the particle size control section.  Orion soils typically are better drained and have a buried soil within 40 inches.  Wakeland soils typically are better drained and have a warmer climate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Newalbin soils have plane or concave slopes with gradient of 0 to 4 percent on flood plains.  They formed in 40 to 70 inches of recent stratified silty alluvium.  These sediments overlie a buried soil.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 34 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Arenzville and Huntsville are the principal associates.  Well drained and moderately well drained Arenzville and Huntsville soils typically occur upstream.  Arenzville soils formed in similar post settlement alluvium.  Huntsville soils formed in fine-silty alluvium, have a thick mollic epipedon, and lack the mantle of light-colored post settlement alluvium."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Mostly poorly drained but some are very poorly drained.  Surface runoff is slow and ponded.  Permeability is moderate.  The soils are subject to occasional flooding of brief duration."
