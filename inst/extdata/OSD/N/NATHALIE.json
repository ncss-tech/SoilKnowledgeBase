  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Nathalie soils were previously mapped as Appling soils. The creation of a mesic region within the southern Piedmont necessitated the establishment of a counterpart to the Appling series. Lab data supports the mineralogy classification of kaolinitic in this portion of MLRA 136, however identification of a kandic horizon is marginal and varied. Some of these soils have been mapped with the Buckhall series. Buckhall soils are not kandic and have mixed mineralogy with moderate shrink-swell potential.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 9 to 52 inches (BA, Bt, and BC horizons)\nKandic horizon--the zone from 9 to 52 inches (BA, Bt, and BC horizons)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: Reference data for particle-size and chemistry of the Bt horizon is available from Virginia Tech., Blacksburg, VA.\nDatabase Information:\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID--103287\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
