    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to fragipan is 16 to 36 inches.  Depth to redox depletions or iron concentrations is 8 to 14 inches.  Content of clay in the control section is 18 to 30 percent.  Rock fragments ranges from 1 to 15 percent in the upper solum above the fragipan, 5 to 25 percent in the fragipan, and 35 to 60 percent in the substratum.  Content of rock fragments in the control section is less than 35 percent.  Kind of rock fragments are metamorphic shale, siltstone, and sandstone channers about 0.5 to 3 inches in diameter and 0.25 inches thick.  In unlimed areas, soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is moderate medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is strong or moderate, coarse or very coarse prismatic parting to moderate, strong coarse or very coarse platy parting to weak fine and medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is firm, very firm and brittle.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is massive.  Consistence is firm or friable."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Albrights, Amwell, Canfield, Rittman, Titusville, Turbotville and Urbana soils are in the same family.  Albrights soils lack hues of 7.5YR or yellower.  Amwell soils have sola thinner than 40 inches.  Canfield and Rittman soils have base saturation greater than 60 percent at a depth 30 inches below the upper boundary of the fragipan.  Titusville soils developed in weathered, pre-Wisconsin glacial till dominantly of sandstone and shale materials.  Turbotville soils range from moderately acid in the upper part of the solum to mildly alkaline in the substratum.  Urbana soils formed in material weathered from crystalline rocks.  Rittman soils have coarse fragments dominated by sandstone and a few erratics."
