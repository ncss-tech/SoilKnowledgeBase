  "OVERVIEW": "The Nockamixon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on hills.  They are formed in colluvium weathered from non-acid gray shale, siltstone and sandstone residuum.  Permeability is moderate above the fragipan, slow to moderately slow in the fragipan, and moderately slow in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 43 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is 54 degrees F.",

Turbotville soils range from moderately acid in the upper part of the solum to mildly alkaline in the substratum.  Urbana soils formed in material weathered from crystalline rocks.  Rittman soils have coarse fragments dominated by sandstone and a few erratics."
