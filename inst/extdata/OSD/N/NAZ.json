Dark colors are due to parent material).\nParalithic contact - at 123cm (Cr horizon)\nLaboratory data exists for a pedon sampled as Naz (xeric moisture regime): Lab Pedon #06N1084, KSSL.\nNaz series is mapped in ID617 at lower elevations (<1525m) and needs to be investigated as a potential frigid taxadjunct to the series.  The depth class and moisture regime of Naz should also be investigated across its extent (currently mapped as deep and very deep).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
