  "OVERVIEW": "The Naz series consist of deep or very deep, well or somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum mainly from intermediate intrusive, quartzitic metamorphic, and porphyritic rocks.  They are on mountains with slopes of 10 to 90 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high.  The average annual precipitation is about 750mm, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Dark colors are due to parent material).\nParalithic contact - at 123cm (Cr horizon)\nLaboratory data exists for a pedon sampled as Naz (xeric moisture regime): Lab Pedon #06N1084, KSSL.\nNaz series is mapped in ID617 at lower elevations (<1525m) and needs to be investigated as a potential frigid taxadjunct to the series.  The depth class and moisture regime of Naz should also be investigated across its extent (currently mapped as deep and very deep)."
