  "OVERVIEW": "The Nestley series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in recent alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, flood plain steps and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
