    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nilesval soils are on inset fans. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Elevations are 1,790 to 1,980 meters (5,870 to 6,500 feet). The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Great Basin. The mean annual precipitation is 260 to 330 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 90 to 135 days."
