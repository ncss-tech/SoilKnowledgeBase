  "OVERVIEW": "The Noseum series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on outwash plains, stream terraces, and glaciofluvial fans and in outwash areas on moraines. They formed in loamy deposits underlain by sandy outwash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the loamy deposits and high or very high in the sandy outwash. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
