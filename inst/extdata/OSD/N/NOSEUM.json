Closely related series are the Croswell, Croswood, Cublake, Gilchrist, Halfaday, Heinz, Manitowish, and Mattix series. All of these soils have mixed mineralogy. In addition, the Croswell, Croswood, Cublake, Gilchrist, and Halfaday soils have less than 15 percent combined content of silt and clay in the upper part of the series control section. The Manitowish soils average more than 10 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section. The Heinz and Mattix soils are calcareous in the lower part of the series control section."
