  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Soil materials are more than 80 inches thick.  Dredging or dragline operations have mixed the materials that have been randomly deposited into a layer that ranges from 6 to 20 feet thick.  Typically 85 percent or more of the mass is clayey material with occasional masses of loamy material. The weighted average clay content of the control section is 40 to 55 percent. Relic iron-manganese and pitted calcium carbonate concretions range from none to common. When dry, cracks 1 to 2 inches wide at the surface extend into the C horizon but remain open for less than 90 cumulative days. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Less than 15 percent of the mass is calcareous.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 8 dS/m in the surface layer and from 2 to 12 dS/m in the lower layers.\nThis soil has color in hue of 10YR to 5Y, and N, value of 4 to 7, chroma of 1 or 2. Masses, layers, streaks, or spots in shades of red, yellow, and brown range from few to many. Relic mollic epipedon materials and cambic materials are throughout the soil."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no soils in the same family. Similar soils are Ijam, Neches, Riolomas, and Sievers soils. Ijam soils are Aquents. Neches and Riolomas soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections and are nonsaline. Sievers soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections and are Aquents."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Neel series consists of man-made soils mainly in marshes. They formed in clayey materials dredged from marshes and shallow bays. These gently sloping to moderately sloping soils are on levees and spoilbanks in the Gulf Coast Saline Prairies and Gulf Coast Marsh. Slopes are typically 2 to 5 percent but range from 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 45 to 60 inches. Frost free days range from 270 to 310 and elevation ranges from 3 to 10 ft above sea level. Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 65 to 82."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Bancker, Leerco, Creole, Harris, Ijam, Surfside, Tracosa, Velasco, and Veston soils. Bancker, Leerco, Creole, and Tracosa soils have n values greater than 0.7 in some part of the pedon. Harris, Velasco, and Surfside soils have mollic epipedons. The competing Ijam soils are on low flat areas adjacent to Neel soils in some areas. All of these soils are slightly lower in the landscape, are wet continually or for very long periods, and serve as source material for Neel soils."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
