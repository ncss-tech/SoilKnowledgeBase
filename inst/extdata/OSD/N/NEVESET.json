  "OVERVIEW": "The Neveset series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from sedimentary rock.  Neveset soils are on cuestas, ledges and structural benches.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
