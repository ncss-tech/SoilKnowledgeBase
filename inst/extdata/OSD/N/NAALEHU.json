The soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to very steep ash fields on lava flows. Slope gradients range from 0 to 70 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 762 to 1,524 millimeters (30 to 60 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1,270 to 1,778 millimeters (50 to 70 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C. (69 to 75 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
