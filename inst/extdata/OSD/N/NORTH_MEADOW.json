  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The North Meadow series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a thin loamy mantle of human transported material over till. They occur on anthropogenic landscapes in and near major urbanized areas of the Northeast. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1196 mm.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the human transported material ranges from 25 to 100 cm. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 percent, with a weighted average of less than 10 percent human artifacts in the control section. Textures are commonly sandy loam, loam or silt loam, but may include thin horizons of loamy sand or sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the human transported mantle, and very strongly acid to neutral beneath.\nSome pedons in wooded areas have O horizons.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Structure is granular or subangular blocky and consistence is very friable or friable, although compacted areas may be platy and/or firm.\nThe ^Bw horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Structure is commonly subangular blocky but can be platy, granular, or the material is massive; consistence is friable or firm.\nSome pedons have ^BC horizons that have properties similar to the ^Bw horizons.\nSome pedons have ^C horizons with hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. The material is generally massive, but may have plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable or firm.\nSome pedons have Ab horizons with hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Structure is granular, subangular blocky, platy, or the material is massive. Consistence is friable or firm.\nSome pedons have 2BAb, 2Bwb or 2Bgb horizons with hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Redoximorphic features are found within 60 centimeters of the mineral soil surface. Structure is granular, subangular blocky, platy, or the material is massive. Consistence is friable or firm.\nSome pedons have 2C horizons with hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. The material is generally massive or single grain, and the consistence is friable or firm."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: North Meadow soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition; excluding them from the concept of Fluvaquentic Dystrudepts. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy in ICOMANTH Circular Letter 7 developed for anthropogenic soils will help to clarify this difference.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 cm (O and A horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 72 cm (Bw horizons).\n3. Aquic subgroup low chroma depletions starting at 61 cm - 58 cm from the mineral soil surface (Bw3 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
