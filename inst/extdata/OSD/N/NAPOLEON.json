  "OVERVIEW": "The Napoleon series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic materials. These soils are in bogs on till plains, outwash plains, lake plains, and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
