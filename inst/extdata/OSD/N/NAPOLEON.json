Mean annual precipitation ranges from 610 to 1067 mm (24 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F)."

The ponded phase has a seasonal high water table from 61 cm (2 feet) above the surface to 15 cm (.5 foot) below the surface throughout the year. Potential surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid."

Principal vegetation is red maple, silver maple, swamp white oak, poison sumac, alder, buttonbush, wild blueberry, dogwood, and Michigan holly in the native state. Pastured soils have reed canarygrass, sedges and some trees. Some of these soils are used for growing domestic blueberries."
