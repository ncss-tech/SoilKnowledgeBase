  "OVERVIEW": "The Needavar series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks with additions of aeolian volcanic ash.  Needavar soils are on lake terraces. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
