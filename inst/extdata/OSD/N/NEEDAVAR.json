  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Needavar soils are on lake terraces. They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with additions of Aeolian volcanic ash. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 2,100 to 2,320 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
