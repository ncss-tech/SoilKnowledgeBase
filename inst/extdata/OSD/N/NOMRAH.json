  "OVERVIEW": "The Nomrah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone. Nomrah soils are on remnant stream terraces and footslopes of stable landslides and have moderate permeability. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
