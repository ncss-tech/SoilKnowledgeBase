Alire soils contain volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions. Pollow and Todest soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Brumley, Goesling, and Maia soils are 40 inches or less to the base of the argillic horizon and the calcic horizon does not include the argillic. In addition, Maia soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments. Banquito soils are inactive."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nomrah soils are on stream terraces and footslopes of stable landslides. They formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sandstone. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 7,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."
