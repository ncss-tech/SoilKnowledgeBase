  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick.  Limestone pebbles and fragments up to 48 inches across and 1/2 inch to 4 inches thick cover 0 to 15 percent of the surface layer.  Most of the fragments are 6 to 24 inches across and 1/2 inch to 2 inches thick. Some fragments are tilted at an angle of 30 to 50 degrees.  Pebbles, cobbles and stones make up 0 to 30 percent by volume of the surface layer.  Calcium carbonate concretions are typically throughout and films, threads, or soft masses of calcium carbonate are within a depth of 15 to 24 inches of the soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay or their stony or very stony counterparts.  Pebbles, cobbles, and stone sized limestone fragments range from 2 to 40 percent by volume but stones and cobbles typically make up 3 to 25 percent.\nThe B horizon has colors mainly in shades of brown with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Yellowish or brownish mottles range from none to a few.  It is silty clay loam, silt loam, or their stony counterparts.  Limestone fragments make up 5 to 35 percent by volume of some layers in this horizon.  However, stony layers are thin, discontinuous, and are absent in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has yellowish, grayish, or brownish colors.  It is interbedded marly and shaly silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  Some pedons have limestone layers 2 to 4 inches thick randomly occurring at vertical intervals of 2 to 6 feet apart."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include Brenham and Denton series in the same family and Bolar, Lewisville, Set and Topsey series in similar families.   Brenham and Set soils have sola greater than 40 inches thick.  Brenham soils formed in Tertiary Age materials.  Set soils formed in Pennsylvania Age materials and are in drier climates.  Denton soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.  Bolar and Topsey soils are fine loamy and in addition, Bolar soils are underlain by hard limestone.  Lewisville soils have mixed mineralogy and do not have stony surfaces."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nuff soils are on erosional uplands. Surfaces are typically convex with slopes of 1 to 6 percent. These soils are on low hills, ridgetops, or narrow stream divides.  Nuff soils formed in the Walnut Clay Geologic Formation of the Lower Cretaceous Period.  Mean annual precipitation is 26 to 34 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 230 to 250 and elevation ranges form 1200 to 1600 feet above sea level.  The Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 44 to 56."

Doss and Real soils are shallow, loamy soils on side slopes below Nuff soils.  Krum and Slidell soils, which are deep, clayey soils, are along drains downslope from Nuff soils.  The loamy Wise soils are on gentle slopes below the Nuff soils."
