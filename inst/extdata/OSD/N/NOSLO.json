Bjork soils are not dominated by 2 to 5 mm diameter gravel, have slightly alkaline argillic horizons, and have moderate or strong prismatic structure.  Dodes soils have 10 to 30 percent pararock fragments of diatomite and do not have weathered granitic rock in the series control section.  Indiano and Pahrange soils have 15 to 35 percent gravel in the argillic horizon and are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Madras and Quiero soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Shoebend soils have mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 12 degrees C. and have frost-free periods of 140 to 155 days.  Simcoe soils have less than 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section and have clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam texture in the argillic horizon.  Uhaldi soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and less than 50 percent sand in the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks with additions of eolian materials.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,925 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
