    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The solum averages 0 to 15 percent rock fragments by volume.  Some pedons have A horizons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It is slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 8 moist or dry.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The reaction is slightly acid through strongly acid.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist or dry.  It is stratified with layers ranging from loamy sand to fine and coarse sand.  Coarse fragment average 0 to 35 percent in the control section and average 0 to 60 percent below.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately acid."

The soils formed in glacial outwash and alluvium with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Average annual precipitation is 50 to 75 inches.  The mean January temperature is 33 degrees F, mean July temperature is 59 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 200 days."
