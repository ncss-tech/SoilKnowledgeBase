Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The solum averages 0 to 15 percent rock fragments by volume.  Some pedons have A horizons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It is slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 8 moist or dry.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The reaction is slightly acid through strongly acid.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 5Y, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist or dry.  It is stratified with layers ranging from loamy sand to fine and coarse sand.  Coarse fragment average 0 to 35 percent in the control section and average 0 to 60 percent below.
