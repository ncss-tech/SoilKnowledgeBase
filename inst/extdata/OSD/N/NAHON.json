  "OVERVIEW": "The Nahon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments on lake plains.  Permeability is very slow in the subsoil. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The ESP exceeds 15 within 2 meters of the upper boundary of the Bt horizon.  Depth to accumulated salts ranges from 16 to 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is moderately acid to neutral. The E horizon is absent in some pedons that have an Ap horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam that averages between 35 and 55 percent clay.  It is neutral to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons do not have gypsum or/other salts in the lower part of the Btn horizon or have a Btnz horizon.\nThe Bz and Bkz horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  They are typically silty clay loam or silty clay but some pedons are silt loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Gypsum and other salts range from few to common. Some pedons have a Bkyz, BC or By horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay, and silty clay.  The lower part is varved very fine sand to clay.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Varves range from 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness.  Some pedons are underlain with sandy materials or loamy glacial till at depths of 40 to 60 inches."

Exline soils have accumulations of salts within 16 inches and have a thinner sola.  Harmony soils do not have a natric horizon.  The Beotia and Great Bend soils are on slightly higher positions.  The Great Bend and Overly soils are on slightly higher positions.  They do not have a natric horizon and are fine-silty."
