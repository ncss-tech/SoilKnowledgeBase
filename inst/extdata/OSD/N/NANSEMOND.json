  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1.  Nansemond soils were formerly mapped as Dragston soils until the Dragston classification was officially changed from Aquic Hapludults to Aeric Ochraquults.  2.  Differentiae between Foreston and Nansemond soils are not clean because of a difference in interpretation of the \"pockets\" and lenses of clean sand grains in Nansemond soils versus \"skeletans\" for these same features in Foreston soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 8 to 29 inches (Bt horizons)\nAquic conditions--the soil has redox depletions and concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon sampled as S95XX003-003.
