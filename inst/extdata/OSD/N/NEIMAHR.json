  "OVERVIEW": "The Neimahr series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from rock gypsum and sandstone. Neimahr soils are on alluvial flats. Slopes are 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F. (18 degrees C)and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches (330 mm).",
