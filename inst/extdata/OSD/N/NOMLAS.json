These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 25 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice (udic moisture regime). Thickness of andic soil material is 20 to 30 inches. The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 1.00 g/cc, 30 to 70 percent volcanic glass, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.7 to 1.2 percent, phosphate retention of 50 to 60 percent, and 15-bar water retention of less than 12 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 80 percent rock fragments. Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist. Texture is very gravelly ashy fine sandy loam or very gravelly ashy sandy loam.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, chroma of 3 to 6 dry and 3 or 4  moist. It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam,  or extremely gravelly fine sandy loam in the upper part.  The lower part includes all the above textures and extremely gravelly loamy sand. It has 20 to 30 percent volcanic glass and 0.3 to 0.4 percent acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

Nomlas soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from andesite, basalt, or mudflow deposits. These soils are in a climate with cool moist summers and cold moderately wet winters. The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F., average July temperature is about 60 degrees F. and average annual temperature ranges from 37 to 43 degrees F. The average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 85 inches. Frost-free season is 35 to 75 days and growing season at 28 degrees F. is 130 to 170 days."
