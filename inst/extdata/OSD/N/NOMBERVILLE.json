Alonzville, Botetourt, Caverns, Coursey, Ingledove, and Shottower soils have argillic horizons and are on stream terraces. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock, contain more rock fragments in the subsoil, and are on uplands.  Broadway soils contain free carbonates and are on similar landscapes.  Derroc soils contain more rock fragments in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Frederick and Groseclose soils are well drained, contain more clay in the subsoil, and are on uplands. Gladehill soils have more sand throughout and are on similar landscapes. Gullion and Irongate soils are moderately well drained and are on similar landscapes. Moomaw soils have a fragipan and are on stream terraces.  Newmarc soils are poorly drained and are on similar landscapes. Wolfgap soils contain more sand in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 13 inches (the Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 50 inches (the Bw horizon).\nFluventic features - irregular decrease in organic matter content with increasing depth.\nUdic moisture regime.\nSoils within the range of the Nomberville series were formerly correlated with the Huntington and Nolin series in several published soil surveys.\nSIR = VA0305\nMLRA = 128, 130, 147\nREVISED = 10/24/05  JWB\nThe 10/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). CEC class is based on the classification of similar and geographically associated soils. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. Competing series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Morphological, chemical, textural, and mineralogical data are reported in:\nEdmonds, W.
