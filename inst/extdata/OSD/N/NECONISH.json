  "OVERVIEW": "The Neconish series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on outwash plains, stream terraces, lake plains and outwash fans. These soils formed in sandy outwash.  Permeability is rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 45 inches. The particle-size control section averages 50 percent or more fine sand. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout the pedon. Depth to free carbonates is greater than 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.  Redox concentrations and saturation occur within 40 inches.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is a mat of highly decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2. It is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon, less than 3 inches thick, with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6. Typically, it is fine sand or loamy fine sand, but some pedons have thin subhorizons of sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is fine sand or loamy fine sand."

The well drained Rousseau and somewhat poorly drained Wainola soils form a drainage sequence with Neconish soils. The moderately well drained Cublake soils are on nearby areas where the sandy deposits are underlain by finer-textured lacustrine sediment at 40 to 60 inches. The moderately well drained Noseum soils are on nearby areas where there is a loamy mantle 10 to 20 inches thick over the sandy deposits."

Typically, timber stands are mostly eastern hemlock, yellow birch, and red maple but some stands are dominantly eastern white pine. Northern red oak, eastern white pine, aspen, paper birch, balsam fir, and red pine are associates in most stands. American beech, sugar maple, northern pin oak, and white oak are associates in some stands. Some areas are cleared and used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland."
