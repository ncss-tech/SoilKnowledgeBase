  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of mineral solum ranges from 15 to 37 inches and depth to carbonates range from 15 to 38 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 3 to 35 percent by volume in the A horizon, 5 to 35 percent in the B horizon, and 5 to 50 percent in the C horizon. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the upper part of the mineral solum, moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part of the solum and neutral to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4, and value 4 through 6, chroma 2 through 5 dry. It ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate granular structure and very friable or friable consistence. Undisturbed areas have an A horizon 2 to 6 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. The B horizon ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure except some subhorizons may be massive. Consistence is very friable or friable. Faint redoximorphic features are at the contact between the B and C horizons in some pedons.\nThe BC or CB horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Faint redoximorphic features are in some pedons. It ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or it is massive with or without plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6. Chroma 2 is a result of parent material or lithologic origin rather than redoximorphic depletion. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Consistence is friable or firm. The C horizon is calcareous and the carbonates are mostly CaCO3. Some pedons have Cd horizons with firm or very firm consistence at 60 inches or below."

Amenia, Massena, and Sun soils are wetter associates of a drainage sequence. Benson soils are shallow to bedock. Honeoye soils have an argillic horizon. Kars soils formed in nearby glacial outwash deposits. Lowville soils are in areas that have silty surficial deposits 18 or more inches thick."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series extends to the cold limit of mesic families in areas where mean annual air temperature is 3 to 3-1/2 degrees below the 47 degree soil temperature limit, but where insulation by snow prevents low winter soil temperature and the expected lower annual soil temperature.\nThe SC file shows this series as being established in 1908. This could not be confirmed, but is being researched.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon:\n1. Ochric Epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 37 inches (Bw1, Bw2, BC1, and BC2 horizons).\n3. Typic Eutrudepts - as evidenced by the cambic horizon and carbonates within a depth of 40 inches.\nLab data for the typical pedon: S85NY031-05.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
