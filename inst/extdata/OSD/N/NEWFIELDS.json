  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 through 36 inches (38 through 91 centimeters). Depth to bedrock is typically greater than 60 inches (1.5 meters). Rock fragments range from 0 through 30 percent in the solum and 5 through 60 percent in the substratum. Rock fragments are dominantly granite, gneiss, schist, and quartzite gravel, but can often include cobbles, stones and boulders. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through slightly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Some pedons have an A horizon that has value of 2 through 3 and chroma of 1 through 3. Some pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the Ap, A and E horizons is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. Texture is dominantly fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction, but includes thin subhorizons of sandy loam and very fine sandy loam in the upper part, with the weighted average of coarse-loamy material containing less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand. Some pedons have a Bs horizon.\nThe BC horizon has color and texture similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, or sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have lenses of sand and gravel. Structure is weak thin platy or the horizon is massive. Consistence is very friable or friable, but may contain thin subhorizons with firm consistence."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in the same family.\nThe Agawam, Branford, Canton, Deerfield, Haven, Narragansett, Scituate, and Sutton series are in related families. Agawam, Branford, and Haven soils have either stratified sand or sand and gravel in the series control section. The Canton and Narragansett soils do not have redoximorphic features. Deerfield soils have sandy textures in the solum. Scituate and Sutton soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Newfields soils are nearly level through moderately steep soils of glaciated uplands and morianes. Slope ranges from 0 through 25 percent. The soils formed in a loamy mantle  over acid sandy melt out till of Wisconsin age derived mainly from granite, gneiss, or quartzite. The till generally contains cobbles and stones with some boulders. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 through 50 inches (889 through 1270 millimeters), and mean annual temperature ranges from 47 through 52 degrees F. (8 through 11 degrees C.)."

Newfields soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Canton soils and the poorly drained Leicester soils. Montauk soils have a dense substratum and are in higher positions on the landscape. Scituate soils have a dense substratum and are in similar positions on the landscape."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 2010 revision reflected changes to the range in characteristics as well as general updating to metric units. This series was classified to the 10th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy with that revision. The former classification was coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Typic Dystrochrepts. Historical notes are maintained in the maintenance file, OSD Historical Notes.\nThere is some debate over the source of the loamy mantle, one theory places it as aeolian.\nThe diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (0 to 23 centimeters) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 35 inches (23 to 89 centimeters) (Bw1, Bw2, BC horizons).\n3. Contrasting particle-size class - both the coarse-loamy part and the sandy part of the particle-size control section are greater than 5 inches (12.5 cm) thick and the transition zone between the two parts is less than 5 inches (12.5 cm) thick.\n4) Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 through 40 inches (25 through 100 centimeters) (part of the Bw1, Bw2, BC, 2C1 horizons).\n5) Lithologic discontinuity - at a depth of 35 inches (89 centimeters).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
