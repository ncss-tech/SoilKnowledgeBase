  "BYREV": "Rev. DFW,RRD",
  "REVDATE": "10/98",
  "STATES": "KY,MD,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Newbern Series are shallow and excessively and somewhat excessively drained with moderate permeability.  They formed in the weathered products of shale, interbedded with thin beds of limestone on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 99 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees E.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness is 10 to 20 inches and depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  Angular shale rock fragments range from 5 to 80 percent in individual horizons, but average less than 35 percent in the control section.  Shale rock fragment content generally increases with depth. Soil reaction is moderately acid through neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  Mottles in shades of yellow or brown occur in some pedons.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 through 8.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 through 8.  It is partially weathered shale with loam or silt loam soil material in cracks and crevices."

Slopes are dominantly 8 to 30 percent but range from 0 to 99 percent.  The soils derived from interbedded shale, siltstone, and limestone.  The climate is humid and cool temperate; mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 44 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 57 degrees F.  The growing season is 160 to 200 days."
