    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nazlini soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces and floodplain steps at elevations of 5,000 to 6,200 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. They formed in stream alluvium from sandstone and shale. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches which occurs as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain and snow. Stream incision is geologically recent, and pedons retain the high stratification and lateral variability of alluvial deposits. The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is  150 to 180 days."
