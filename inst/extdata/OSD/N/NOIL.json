These soils formed in material weathered from gneiss, schist, granite or quartzite with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils occur at elevations of 1,600 to 4,300 feet \t(488 to 1311 meters).  The average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F., with an average annual precipitation of 25 to 55 inches (635 to 1397 mm).  The average frost-free period is from 80 to 130 days."
