  "OVERVIEW": "The Noil series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes and ridges.  They formed in material weathered from metamorphic or granitic rocks with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slope ranges from 35 to 85 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 32 inches.",
