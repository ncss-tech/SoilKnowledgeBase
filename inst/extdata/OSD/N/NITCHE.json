    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  The depth to the loamy glacial till ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The volume of rock fragments in the horizons formed in outwash sediments ranges from 0 to 35 percent mostly gravel in size.  Horizons formed in glacial till typically have 1 to 15 percent gravel size rock fragments and 0 to 5 percent cobble size rock fragments.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology.  The soil moisture control section is moist in all or some parts throughout the year 6 out of 10 years.  In addition, the soil moisture control section is not dry in some or all parts for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 when dry, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy sand.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  The Bt horizon is composed of either continuous or discontinuous horizons or layers.\nThe 2Bt horizon has similar color as the Bt and has textures of loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  The argillic horizon averages between 8 to 18 percent clay and 50 to 70 percent sand.   Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 2Bw horizon with similar properties to the 2Bt but do not have clay bridging between sand grains.\nThe 2Bk horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 3Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  The clay content ranges from 7 to 18 percent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Boyett soils are dry in some or all parts of the soil moisture control section for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nitche soils are on nearly level to sloping landscapes on moraines and till plains that have been mantled by outwash sediments.  They are formed in outwash material and the underlying glacial till that is Late Wisconsin in age.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.  Annual frost free days range from 90 to 140 days.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1500 feet."

The well drained Almora, Dorset and the Lida soils have similar landscape positions but are not underlain by glacial till within 80 inches.  The poorly drained Brandsvold soils are in swales.  The very poorly drained Cathro and Runeberg soils are in depressions and swales.  The well drained Kandota soils have similar landscape positions but formed entirely in glacial till.  The moderately well drained Knute and Clitherall soils are in concave areas and shallow drainageways."
