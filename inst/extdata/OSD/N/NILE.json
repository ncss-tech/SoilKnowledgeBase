These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The upper 14 to 35 inches is dominated by volcanic ash and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 1.10 g/cc, glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.5 to 1.5 percent, phosphorus retention is 25 to 50, and 15 bar water retention of 8 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The lower particle-size control section averages 7 to 16 percent clay, 15 to 30 percent rock fragments and 15 to 30 percent pararock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 2 to 4 moist. Texture is ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam. Reaction is slightly to strongly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon reaction is slightly to moderately acid. Texture is gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, cobbly sandy loam, or very cobbly sandy loam.\nThe 3Bw horizon and BC horizon, when present, has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam, or cobbly sandy loam. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Almac, Codylake, Gahee, Helter and Shanahan series. Soils with similar classification except for mineralogy class are the Gap and Prairie series. Almac, Gap and Gahee soils have argillic horizons. Codylake soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Helter soils have silt loam texture in the upper part of the control section and silt loam, silty clay loam or loam texture in the lower part of the control section with no pararock fragments. Prairie soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Shanahan soils have 5 to 35 percent pumice sized fragments greater than 2 mm in size in the ash mantle and contain 70 to 100 percent glass and glass coated aggregates."

These soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium from conglomorate tuffaceous sandstone of Ellensburg Formation materials. These soils are in a marine influenced climate characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 55 inches. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 62 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free season is 40 to 80 days."
