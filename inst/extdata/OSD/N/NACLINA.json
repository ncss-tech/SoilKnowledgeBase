  "OVERVIEW": "The Naclina series consists of residual soils that are deep to shale.  They are very slowly permeable and well drained.  These soils are on broad gently sloping to steep coastal plains.  The slope is dominantly 5 to 10 percent but ranges from 1 to 35 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  When dry, cracks 1/2 to more than 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches.  Cracks remain open from 60 to 90 cumulative days in most years.  Slickensides and wedge-shaped peds begin at a depth of 10 to 24 inches.  Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls about 4 to 12 inches above the microdepressions.\nDistance from the center of the microknoll to the center of the microdepression ranges from 4 to about 15 feet.  Colors with chroma of 2 or less in the subsoil are considered to be litho-chromic.  Mottles with chroma of 3 or more, or redox concentrations, are considered to be relic or litho-chromic.\nThe A horizon has colors in shades of brown with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Horizons with mollic colors are less than 12 inches thick in more than half the pedon.  The texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has colors mainly in shades of red or brown with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles in shades of gray or brown range for none to common.  The texture is silty clay or clay.  The reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bss and Bkss horizons have colors mainly in shades of  brown, olive, or yellow with hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles with these colors and colors with chroma of 2 or less range from few to many and some subhorizons have a mottled matrix.  The texture is silty clay or clay.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the Bss horizon and from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part.  The reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the Bkss horizon.\nThe C horizon has colors in shades of brown, gray, olive, and yellow.  It is a shale or shale and marl with clay texture.  The material is in variegated layers, platy, or weakly bedded.  Effervesence ranges from very slight to strong in most pedons.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Closely similar soils include the Burkeville, Dylan, Hallsbluff, LaCerda, Morse, Redco, and Tahoula.  Burkeville, Dylan, LaCerda, Redco, and Tahoula soils have very-fine particle-size control sections.  In addition Burkeville, Dylan, LaCerda, and Redco soils have a solum thicker than 60 inches.  Also, LaCerda soils are more acid in the surface layer.  Hallsbluff soils have mollic colors from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches.  Morse soils have mixed mineralogy."

Slopes are mainly 5 to 10 percent but range from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 42 to 52 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degrees F., and the frost free days range from 230 to 245.  The elevation ranges from 200 to 600 feet above sea level.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 66."

Etoile and Woodtell soils have a loamy epipedon and a clayey  argillic horizon.  Etoile soils commonly have slopes less than 5 percent with plane or concave surfaces and are on slightly higher positions.  Woodtell soils are on similar positions in the landscape."

The classification is changed from Aquentic Chromuderts to Chromic Hapluderts based on the new classification for Vertisols.  In addition, this soil does not have aquic soil conditions (January 1994).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon\nare:\nOchric epipedon--the A1 and A2 horizon; also includes the chromic feature, a color value of 4 or more in some  subhorizon within 12 inches of the surface.\nCambic horizon--the Bw, Bss, and Bssk horizons.\nVertic features--cracks when dry that are 1/2 inch wide to a depth of more than 12 inches;  slickesides from a depth of 14 to 46 inches in the Bss subhorizons.\nSOIL INTERPRETATION RECORD:  TX0704\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
