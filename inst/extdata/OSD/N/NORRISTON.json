  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 59 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally exceeds 60 inches but ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to the noncontrasting sandy-skeletal IIC horizon and depth to the base of the argillic horizon range from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments average 35 to 75 percent in the 10- to 40-inch section.  Fragments range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter and are usually less than 1 inch.  Within the sand fraction the content of medium and coarser angular sand having a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains ranges from 15 to about 90 percent and horizons of low organic matter content have a differential between dry and moist consistence that is 1 to 3 times greater than soils of similar texture having finer or more rounded sand grains.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically coarse sandy loam but averages 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 50 to 82 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand and with a large proportion of the sand fraction being coarse to very coarse angular sand.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline line.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5y through 7.5YR.  It is gravelly or very gravelly loamy coarse sand or coarse sand.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

Bowman, Buena Vista, Elwood, Nathrop, and Woodhall soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Blaine, Parkview, and Winada soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Ess, Geertsen, Libeg, Packer, Quander, and Tahquats soils have more than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon and lack a sandy-skeletal substratum above a depth of 40 inches.  Hoodle and Thiel soils have a continuous horizon of secondary carbonate accumulation and have an argillic horizon with more than 18 percent clay.  Fourmile soils have contrasting particle-size in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Norriston soils are on eskers, glacial moraines, alluvial fans, and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent slopes.  These soils formed in thick, noncalcareous, glacial or alluvial materials derived principally from granite.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F."
