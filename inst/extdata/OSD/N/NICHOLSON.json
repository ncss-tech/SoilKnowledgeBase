  "OVERVIEW": "The Nicholson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with a slowly permeable fragipan in the subsoil.  The soils formed in a mantle of loess or silty material underlain by residuum of limestone, calcareous shale, and siltstone.  The soil is on upland ridgetops. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Near the type location, the annual air temperature is 53.3 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 41.3 inches.",

Texture is dominantly silt loam, however in some severely eroded areas it is silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and 5, chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have redoximorphic features in shades of brown or gray below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.

Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8  with few to common redoximorphic features in shades of gray, red, or brown, or is an evenly mottled pattern in these colors.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe 2C horizons has colors similar to that of the 2Bt horizon.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay and their channery and gravelly analogues."

The Bedford soils formed in loess over Mississippian and/or Silurian age limestone, have redder hues in the lower part of the solum and substratum, and have higher Ksat values in the lower part of the solum and substratum. The Boston soils formed in loess, till, and limestone residuum.  The Solsberry and Cincinnati soils formed in loess over materials of glacial origin.  The Hosmer soils formed in loess deeper than 60 inches.  Apalona, Fountainville, and Zanesville soils formed in loess over residuum of sandstone, siltstone, or shale.  Otwell soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess over lacustrine and glacial outwash materials and are well drained. Otwood soils formed in a mixture of loess and silty alluvium and the underlying clayey or loamy residuum of shale, siltstone, sandstone, or limestone on stream terraces. Omulga soils have stratified materials in the lower part of the solum. Weisburg soils are formed in 22 to 40 inches of loess and in Illinoian age glacial till and clayey residuum."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  When the classification of the Bedford soil series was changed from an Ultisol to an Alfisol, these soils became very similar.  The Nicholson soils developed from loess (or silty material) over interbeded limestone, calcareous shale and siltstone of the Ordovician age.  The Bedford soils developed from loess (or silty material) over limestone of the Missippian and/or Silurian age.  The structure in the substratum of the Nicholson soils is not as well developed as that of the Bedford soils because of the interbeded calcareous shale and siltstone.  Therefore, the Ksat in the substratum of the Nicholson soils is slower than the Bedford soils.  The colors of the substratum for the Nicholson soils tend to be yellower than the Bedford soils.  The Nicholson soils are 7.5YR or yellower, and the Bedford soils are 5YR and redder.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (Ap)\nArgillic horizon - 8 to 50 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btx, 2Bt3)\nFragipan - 28 to 38 inches (Btx)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
