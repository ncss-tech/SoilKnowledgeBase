Mccullan soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for shorter periods because of lower rainfall component in addition to warmer soil temperatures as a result of lower elevations. Rayohill soils have gypsum bedrock between 20 and 40 inches of the surface.  Alamogordo and Yesum soils are in the thermic family."
