    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Mccullan and Rayohill series. Similar soils are the Alamogordo and Yesum series. Mccullan soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for shorter periods because of lower rainfall component in addition to warmer soil temperatures as a result of lower elevations. Rayohill soils have gypsum bedrock between 20 and 40 inches of the surface.  Alamogordo and Yesum soils are in the thermic family."

The average annual temperature ranges from 49 to 58 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,500 feet."

Jornaham soils have mixed mineralogy and are on knolls and piedmont slopes. La Fonda soils have a cambic horizon and have mixed mineralogy and are on drainageways."
