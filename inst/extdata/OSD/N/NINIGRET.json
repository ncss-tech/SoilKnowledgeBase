  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 through 38 inches and typically corresponds to the depth of sand or sand and gravel. Rock fragments, mainly rounded pebbles, range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the solum, from 0 to 30 percent in the substratum above a depth of 40 inches, and from 0 to 60 percent below. Unless limed, the soil is very strongly acid through moderately acid to a depth of 30 inches and very strongly acid through slightly acid below 30 inches.\nSome pedons have an O horizon up to 2 inches thick. It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has weak or moderate granular structure, or it is massive\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value and chroma of 2 through 4. Dry value is 6 or more. Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 through 3 and chroma of 1 through 3. The Ap or A horizon is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. The lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is typically fine sandy loam with less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand or very fine sandy loam, but includes silt loam and loam. Stucture is weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky, or it is massive. Consistence is very friable or friable. Some pedons have a sandy loam Bw subhorizon or BC horizon less than 5 inches thick just above the 2C horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 6. It typically has redoximorphic features. The horizon is commonly stratified sand and gravel. Texture of individual layers ranges from coarse sand to fine sand thrrough loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ninigret soils are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on glaciofluvial landforms. Slopes range from 0 through 15 percent, but commonly are 0 through 8 percent. The soils formed in loamy over stratified sandy and gravelly glacial outwash derived from a variety of acid rocks. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 through 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 through 50 inches, and the growing season ranges from 120 through 195 days."

The well drained Agawam and Haven soils and the poorly drained Walpole and Raypol soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Dartmouth and Scio soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections. Deerfield and Sudbury soils are sandy terrace associates. Enfield, Haven, and Narragansett soils do not have low chroma depletions within a 24 inch depth. Raynham soils are poorly drained silty soils in low areas. Tisbury soils are coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Wapping soils are coarse-loamy."

Some areas are idle, wooded, or used for community development. Common trees are red, white and black oak, red maple, sugar maple, white pine, gray birch, white ash, and hemlock."
