  "OVERVIEW": "The Nicholia series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Nicholia soils are on outwash fans, alluvial fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
