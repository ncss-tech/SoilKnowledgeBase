The soils formed in coarse alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  The climate is cold and moist in winter dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation range from 8 to 11 inches.  Average summer temperature is 55 to 58 degrees F. and average annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
