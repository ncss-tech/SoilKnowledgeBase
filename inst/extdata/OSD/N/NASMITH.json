  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 13 to 26 inches.  Depth to contrasting material ranges from 15 to 36 inches.  Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles and range from 0 to 30 percent in the glaciofluvial material and from 0 to 5 percent in the underlying 2C material. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand in the fine earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a C horizon above the contrasting layers that has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay, which may be stratified with layers of loamy fine sand or fine sand. The weighted average clay content in the 2Cg horizon is less than 35 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in this family. The Coveytown and Enosburg series are in related families.  Coveytown soils have endosaturation and are underlain by till.  Enosburg soils have a mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nasmith soils are on lake plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits underlain by loamy glaciolacustrine deposits of Wisconsin age.   The glaciofluvial deposits are derived mainly from phyllite or schist.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 50 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F. The frost free season ranges from 90 to 135 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the somewhat excessively drained Adams, excessively drained Colton, moderately well drained Sheepscot and Nicholville soils, and somewhat poorly drained Lamoine soils.  Adams, Colton and Sheepscot soils are generally at higher elevations on nearby kames and stream terraces.  Lamoine, and Nicholville soils have finer textured sola and are in slightly higher positions on the landscape."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1. The classification is revised with this revision. 2. The Nasmith series replaces some soils formally mapped as Enosburg that have a frigid temperature regime. The former classification was Sandy over loamy, mixed, nonacid, frigid Typic Humaquepts.  3. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Aquents feature - a layer directly under the epipedon that has 50 percent or more chroma 2 in the matrix with redox concentrations (Bg1 horizon).\nc. Aeric feature - hue of 2.5Y with value of 5 and chroma of 2 (Bg1 horizon).\nd. Strongly contrasting particle size class - the transition between the sandy material and the loamy material in the control section (10 to 40 inches) is less than 5 inches.  The loamy material has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
