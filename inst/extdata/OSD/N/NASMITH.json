  "OVERVIEW": "The Nasmith Series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on dissected lake plains and stream terraces. They formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits underlain by loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the solum and slow or very slow in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Depth to contrasting material ranges from 15 to 36 inches.  Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles and range from 0 to 30 percent in the glaciofluvial material and from 0 to 5 percent in the underlying 2C material. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand in the fine earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a C horizon above the contrasting layers that has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay, which may be stratified with layers of loamy fine sand or fine sand. The weighted average clay content in the 2Cg horizon is less than 35 percent."

Adams, Colton and Sheepscot soils are generally at higher elevations on nearby kames and stream terraces.  Lamoine, and Nicholville soils have finer textured sola and are in slightly higher positions on the landscape."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1. The classification is revised with this revision. 2. The Nasmith series replaces some soils formally mapped as Enosburg that have a frigid temperature regime. The former classification was Sandy over loamy, mixed, nonacid, frigid Typic Humaquepts.  3. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Aquents feature - a layer directly under the epipedon that has 50 percent or more chroma 2 in the matrix with redox concentrations (Bg1 horizon).\nc. Aeric feature - hue of 2.5Y with value of 5 and chroma of 2 (Bg1 horizon).\nd. Strongly contrasting particle size class - the transition between the sandy material and the loamy material in the control section (10 to 40 inches) is less than 5 inches.  The loamy material has less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
