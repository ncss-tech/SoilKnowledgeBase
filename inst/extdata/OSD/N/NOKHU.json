  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 17 to 55 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to continuous horizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 17 to 55 inches.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches and depth to base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 55 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum and C and are mainly 0 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A1 horizon if present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically heavy clay loam or clay but averages 35 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt, an 15 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.   This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  This horizon ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline and has 4 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam with clay ranging from 18 to 35 percent."

Asperson, Gateway, and Hatch soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Azarman and Cowdrey soils lack consistent horizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation above a depth of 40 inches and are noncalcareous throughout.  Bead, Lail, and Muggins soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Chubbs, Foxton, McVickers, Wetterhorn, and Wickenson soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Contide soils have sola thicker than 55 inches and have very think A2 and A&B horizons with the top of the argillic horizon occurring at depths greater than 24 inches.  Dell soils lack consistent visible accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate above a depth of 40 inches.  Mikesell soils have sola 40 to 65 inches thick that extend to bedrock and are noncalcareous throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nokhu soils are on gently to steeply sloping alluvial fans, mountainsides, and valley filling side slopes.  Slopes typically range from about 2 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in thick, calcareous, medium to moderately fine textured materials derived from sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F."
