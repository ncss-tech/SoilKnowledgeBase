  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nokhu series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in thick, calcareous, medium to moderately fine textured materials derived from sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks. These soils are on gently to steeply sloping alluvial fans, mountainsides, and valley filling side slopes. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 640 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",

Azarman and Cowdrey soils lack consistent horizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation above a depth of 100 cm and are noncalcareous throughout.  Bead, Lail, and Muggins soils have hue of 5YR or redder.  Chubbs, Foxton, McVickers, Wetterhorn, and Wickenson soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 100 cm.  Contide soils have sola thicker than 140 cm and have very think E and A/B horizons with the top of the argillic horizon occurring at depths greater than 60 cm.  Dell soils lack consistent visible accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate above a depth of 100 cm.
