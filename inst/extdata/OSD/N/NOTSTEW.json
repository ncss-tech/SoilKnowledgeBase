Copenhaver and Nieman soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Donkehill soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.  Hogmalat soils have mean annual soil temperature of 3 to 4 degrees C. and reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid in the argillic horizon.  Layview soils are dominated by gravel and do not have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Maygal soils have lithic contacts that are 36 to 50 cm from the soil surface, are dominated by gravel, and average 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Mosroc soils have rock fragments that are granitic rocks and are not influenced by volcanic glass.  Mountpatterson soils have mean summer soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C.  Nielsen soils are dominated by channers and have rock fragments that are sandstone or quartzite.  Thiefridge soils have Oi horizons, have lithic contacts that are 36 to 50 cm from the soil surface, have 4 to 10 percent organic matter in the A horizons, and have mean summer soil temperature of 10 to 12 degrees C."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Notstew soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,445 to 3,330 meters.  The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
