  "OVERVIEW": "The Niter series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and tuff.  Niter soils are on hillslopes, lake terraces, fan remnants, and valley floors.  Slopes are 1 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",

Watercanyon and Brifox soils lack mollic epipedons.  Iphil, Kucera, Rexburg, Ririe and Watercanyon soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections.  Brifox, Iphil, Ririe and Watercanyon soils are on convex positions on hillslopes.  Kucera and Lanoak soils are on concave positions on hillslopes.  Rexburg soils are on less sloping areas on hilltops and footslopes."
