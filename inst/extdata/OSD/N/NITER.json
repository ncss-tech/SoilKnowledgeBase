These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, quartzite, sandstone, and tuff.  Slopes are 1 to 35 percent.  Elevations range from 1,490 to 2,180 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 500 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 2.2 to 7.2 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 60 to 110 days."

Kucera, Lanoak, Rexburg and Ririe soils have noncalcareous mollic epipedons.  Also, Kucera and Lanoak soils are pachic and Lanoak has a fine-silty textural section.  Watercanyon and Brifox soils lack mollic epipedons.  Iphil, Kucera, Rexburg, Ririe and Watercanyon soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections.  Brifox, Iphil, Ririe and Watercanyon soils are on convex positions on hillslopes.  Kucera and Lanoak soils are on concave positions on hillslopes.  Rexburg soils are on less sloping areas on hilltops and footslopes."

It was previously assumed that stratified lacustrine sediments seasonally perched water. However, no redoximorphic features, nor high water table has been documented in the field.
