  "OVERVIEW": "The Nirling series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash. These soils are on outwash plains, moraines, stream terraces, flood plains, drainageways and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 355 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
