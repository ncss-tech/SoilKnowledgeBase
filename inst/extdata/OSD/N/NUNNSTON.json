  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick. Depth to horizons of carbonate accumulation ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Coarse fragments are typically less than 5 percent and range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 63 degrees F. The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than three-fifths of the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is clay or clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay. Structure is prismatic or angular blocky. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is typically clay but may be clay loam with 30 to 45 percent clay. Structure is fine or medium angular blocky. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is typically clay but may be clay loam with 30 to 45 percent clay. Lime occurs as segregated, irregularly shaped, soft masses. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The Bearpaw soils have till at 30 to 40 inches. The Burnel, Pagoda, Suposo, and Yankee soils are pachic. The Cedarsprings, Friana, Tomasaki, and Tsoodzil soils do not have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation. The Cerro soils have a B/A horizon and have stones in the Bt and Btk horizons. Coben soils have accumulations of gypsum at 40 to 60 inches. Danvers soils have a calcic horizon. Fergus soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder below the Bt1 horizon. The Gerbana, Regent, and Reget soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Gerber soils have a discontinuity of till at 32 inches. Mondamin soils have redox features at 24 to 40 inches. Ridgeview soils have free carbonates at 8 to 12 inches. Savage soils contain more silt and are generally at lower elevations."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are typically 0 to 10 percent but range to 15 percent on rolling landscapes. The soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary rock. Elevation is 4,600 to 7,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 19 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
