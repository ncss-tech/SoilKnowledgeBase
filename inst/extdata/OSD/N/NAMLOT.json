  "OVERVIEW": "The Namlot series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone.  Namlot soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
