  "OVERVIEW": "The Noisy series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Noisy soils are moderately deep to bedrock with fractures less than 10 centimeters apart.  These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1524 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
