  "OVERVIEW": "The Northwater series consists of deep well drained soils formed in material derived from sedimentary rocks.  Northwater soils are on mountainsides, foot slopes and swales.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
