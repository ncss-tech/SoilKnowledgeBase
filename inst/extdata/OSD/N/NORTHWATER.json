  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 40 inches but usually is within 70 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 54 inches.  The profile ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline and is noncalcareous throughout.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is 24 or more inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragments are usually less than 15 percent by volume, but ranges to include up to 55 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam and averages more than 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments from sandstone are mostly thin and flat and range from 35 to 65 percent by volume.  The dominant size is 3/4 to 3 inches in length, but range from 2 millimeters to 24 inches in length.   Some sandstone fragments are rounded to stone size.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y and ranges up to 85 percent rock fragments."

Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Elevation ranges from 7,700 to 9,800 feet, but ranges down to 5,600 feet in Idaho.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 30 inches, of which the greater percentage comes as snow. Mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free period is less than 75 days."
