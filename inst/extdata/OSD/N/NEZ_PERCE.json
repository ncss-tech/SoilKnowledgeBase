    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chicane, Conley, Kooskia, Lookingglass, and Shebang series. Chicane soils have a mollic  epipedon more than 20 inches thick, a cambic horizon above the albic horizon, and lack iron-manganese concretions larger than 2mm in the albic horizon and above a depth of about 40 inches. Conley soils have A1 or Ap horizons 10 inches or less thick, an E horizon that separates horizons making up the mollic epipedon, are somewhat poorly drained, and may have mottles in the E and B2 horizons. Kooskia soils have chroma of 1.5 or more in the upper 7 inches and lack chroma of 2 or mottles or iron-manganese concretions larger than 2mm in the albic horizon.  Lookingglass soils do not have accumulations of secondary carbonates in the Bt horizon.  Shebang soils have a mollic epipedon 7 to 12 inches thick and are 8 to 14 inches deep to the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nez Perce soils are on loess-covered  hills and basalt plateaus at elevations of 2,600 to 4,100 feet and have slopes from 0 to 25 percent. They formed in loess, although the lower part may be formed in material weathered from the underlying basalt. The climate is subhumid with an average annual precipitation of 19 to 24 inches including 4 to 7 feet of snow. Peak precipitation is in May and June and minimum precipitation in July and August. The average annual air temperature is 44 to 48 degrees F.  The average frost-free season (32 degrees F.) ranges from about 100 to 140 days."
