These soils are usually moist, and are dry 30 to 45 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic moisture regime.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal substratum is 14 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section has andic soil properties with a cumulative thickness of 14 to 20 inches and 50 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 12 to 25 percent for air dried samples, and acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  The lower part (thickest part) of the particle size control section lacks andic soil properties.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry and value of 4 or 5 dry.  Reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.  It has 2 to 5 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, or very gravelly medial sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 2 to 7 percent organic matter.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y moist and dry, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It is extremely cobbly sand, extremely gravelly sand, or extremely gravelly loamy sand. Reaction is moderately or slightly acid."
