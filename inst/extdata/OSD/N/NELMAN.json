  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon of the surface 15 inches averages approximately .5 percent.  Sand/clay ratio ranges from 3 to 10.  The control section is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 8 to 18 percent clay.  The C horizon generally contains some visible calcium carbonate accumulation but such accumulation is discontinuous and variable among pedons and is not considered to be definitive of the series.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 78 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist in some part between depths of 8 to 24 inches or to bedrock if shallower for approximately 1/4 to 1/2 of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. and are moist in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches or to bedrock if shallower for less than 60 cumulative days during the 120 days following the winter solstice.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  When the surface horizon is as dark as 5 dry or 3 moist it is too thin or contains too little organic carbon to qualify as a mollic epipedon.  This horizon is mildly to strongly alkaline (pH 7.8 to 8.6).  It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 9.0) and has about 1 to 6 percent calcium carbonate equivalents."

The soils formed in moderately thick, calcareous, moderately coarse textured sediments weathered from sandstone bedrock.  At the type location average annual precipitation is 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and early summer.  Average annual temperature is 40 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 63 degrees F."
