  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. The soil has a udic moisture regime, but has a short dry period of less than 45 days during the four-month period following the summer solstice. Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches. Depth to the Bsm horizon is 24 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Fine concretions range from 0 to 10 percent. It is very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 to 7 dry, chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry. It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay. It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry. It is fine sand or loamy fine sand with 1 to 5 percent clay. It is strongly acid or moderately acid. In some pedons on ridgetops and steeper side slopes where drainage is better, the E horizon is more weakly expressed.\nThe 2Bsm horizon has variegated colors, hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is weakly to strongly cemented. Typically, the stronger cementation is in the thin nearly continuous reddish colored bands rather than the softer intervening layers.\nThe 2C horizon has variegated colors, hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry and chroma of 2 through 6. It is stratified fine sand through silt loam with thin discontinuous lenses of gravel in some pedons. It is massive and compact but has layers that are single grained and others that are weakly cemented."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in this family. The Bandon, Blacklock and Depoe series are in other families. Bandon soils are well drained and contain less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Blacklock and Depoe soils are poorly drained and are less than 20 inches deep to the cemented Bsm horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nelscott soils are on incised marine terraces at elevations of 50 to 300 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. These soils formed in mixed eolian silty material overlying marine sediments. The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 53 degrees F., mean January temperature is about 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 300 days."
