  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 10 to 50 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the A and E horizons, and from extremely acid to moderately alkaline in the other horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma 1 or 2.  Total thickness of the A and E horizons is 9 to 25 inches.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The Bh horizon is 3 to 6 inches thick, and is discontinuous.  It ranges from 50 to 85 percent continuous in most pedons.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4; or hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 6.  In some pedons, this horizon has few or common, fine or medium mottles in shades of gray, brown, and yellow.  Some pedons also have pockets of dark gray or gray fine sand in this horizon.  Pockets are 2 to 5 millimeters in diameter.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a B'h horizon at depths of more than 59 inches.  Color and texture are the same as Bh horizon.\nDominantly the C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4; or hue of 5Y or 5GY, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1.  In the lower part of some pedons the C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Mottles are few to many, fine to coarse, and are in shades of gray, brown, and yellow.  Texture is dominantly sand or fine sand, but ranges to loamy sand in a few areas.\nShell substratum phases are recognized.  Texture includes gravelly sand or gravelly fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cassia, Electra, Newnan, Pomello, and Zolfo series.  Cassia soils have Bh horizons which are continuous in more than 90 percent of each pedon.  Electra and Newnan soils have a Bt horizon below the Bh horizon.  In addition, in Electra the depth to the Bh horizon is 30 to 50 inches.  Pomello soils have A and E horizons that combined are 30 to 50 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Narcoossee soils are on low knolls and ridges within the flatwoods of central and southern Florida.  Slope gradients are 0 to 5 percent, and elevation above surrounding soils is 1 to 3 feet.  Annual precipitation ranges from about 50 to 60 inches, and mean annual temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F.  Precipitation is unevenly distributed throughout the year.  Heaviest rainfall occurs during the summer from about June to October."

Adamsville and Tavares soils do not have spodic horizons and, additionally, Tavares soils are better drained.  Myakka and Smyrna soils are poorly drained and have more strongly developed Bh horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Narcoossee soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is very slow.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the Bh horizon and rapid in the A, E, BC, and C horizons.  The water table is within depths of 2 to 3.5 feet for 4 to 6 months in most years.  During extended dry periods, the water table recedes to depths greater than 60 inches.  During periods of high rainfall the water table may rise to depths of 10 to 20 inches for brief periods."

Native vegetation is dominantly water oak, willow oak, live oak, laurel oak, longleaf pine, slash pine, greenbrier, sawpalmetto, pineland threeawn, creeping bluestem, panicum, purple lovegrass, and lopsided Indiangrass."

The revision changed the series classification to recognize the 1992 amendments to Soil Taxonomy that introduced changes in classification of Spodosols.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 22 inches (the A, E1, and E2 horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from a depth of 5 inches to a depth of 22 inches (the E1 and E2 horizons).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from a depth of 22 inches to a depth of 26 inches (the Bh1 and Bh2 horizons).\nDATA:  Soil Characterization Lab., IFAS, UOF\nS51-1-(1-9), S53-24-(1-7), S54-2-(1-8), S55-9-(1-8),\nS64-3-(1-8)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
