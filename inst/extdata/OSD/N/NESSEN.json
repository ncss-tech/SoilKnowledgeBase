  "OVERVIEW": "The Nessen series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils on lake plains, outwash plains, and moraines. These soils formed in sandy material overlying calcareous sand and gravelly material. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
