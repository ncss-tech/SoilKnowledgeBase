  "OVERVIEW": "The Nosser series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess, slope alluvium and residuum weathered from basalt on hillslopes and dissected plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches following summer solstice and are moist during the winter and spring.  The epipedon does not meet the organic carbon requirement for mollic although the color criteria is met.  The particle-size control section averages 28 to 32 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 20 to 35 percent rock fragments by volume.  Depth to a lithic contact with basalt ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. The Bt2 is gravelly clay loam or clay loam.\nThe 2Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  It very cobbly or extremely gravelly clay loam, very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Abgese, Ackelton, Ackley, Blacknest, Esha, Greenbrae, Hardtrigger, Harsan, Hoosegow, Lankbush, Morfitt, Paulville, Sevy, Shawave, Turria, Windypoint, and Zane soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock.  Colbar soils lack a lithologic discontinuity in the argillic horizon, have pockets of loam in the fractured rhyolite and lack silica coatings. Eusbio and Stiles soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches. Sidlake soils have less than 10 percent coarse fragments."
