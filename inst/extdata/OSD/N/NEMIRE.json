  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nemire series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over older alluvium, glacial outwash, or glaciolacustrine deposits. Nemire soils are in drainageways and depressions on nonglaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
