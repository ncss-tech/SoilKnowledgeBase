  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nemire soils are in drainageways and depressions and on nonglaciated plateaus at elevations of 1,200 to 3,200 feet. These soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over older alluvium, glacial outwash or glaciolacustrine sediments. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Average January temperature is 26 degrees F.; average July temperature is 70 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 180 days."

Potential native vegetation on side slopes is bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, lupine, Wyoming big sagebrush, and threetip sagebrush. Vegetation in drainageways and low areas is basin wildrye, Wyoming big sagebrush and threetip sagebrush."
