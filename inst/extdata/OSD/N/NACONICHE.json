Organic matter content ranges from 2 to 15 percent in the upper 16 inches and averages more than 1 percent throughout the upper 20 inches.  Iron manganese concretions and masses range from none to few.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon including buried A horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of N to 3.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, mucky loamy sand, mucky sandy loam, and mucky fine sandy loam.  Streaks and spots of black, white, gray, or brown range from none to common.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 10YR, value 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redox concentrations in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Pickney series is the only competing series in this family.  Series in similar families include Englehard, Elkins, Melhomes, and Osier.  The Pickney series does not have buried A horizons and formed in marine sediments.  Englehard soils have coarse-silty control sections.  Elkins soils have fine-silty control sections.  Melhomes soils have sandy textures throughout and have a regular decrease in organic matter with depth.  Osier soils have an argillic horizon below a depth of 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Naconiche soils are on nearly level flood plains with poorly defined stream channels and in depressional areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in stratified  sandy and loamy alluvial sediments.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 50 inches.  Elevation ranges from 420 to 450 feet above sea level.  Growing season ranges from 235 to 250 days. The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 66 to 74."

These soils are well drained or excessively drained.  Kawah soils are in depressional upland positions.  They do not have buried A horizons and their water table is typically below a depth of 18 inches. Iuka soils are on adjacent flood plains and they have coarse-loamy control sections and are moderately well drained."

The water table is at or within 12 inches of the surface for 12 months in most years.  These soils are frequently flooded or they pond water for long or very long durations."
