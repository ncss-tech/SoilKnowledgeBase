  "OVERVIEW": "The Nihill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in gravelly alluvium from mixed sources.  They are on late Pleistocene terraces and terrace remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Nihill soils typically contain free carbonates throughout but are leached free of carbonates in the upper few inches in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has a matrix texture of clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam with 15 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments, typically rounded pebbles, range from 35 to 70 percent.  There is typically less than 5 percent larger than 3 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 45 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk or C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to 14 percent.  It is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline."

Elevations range from 2,600 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches but ranges from 10 to 19 inches with about half falling as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F., but ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 105 to 130 days."

Hesper, Keiser, and Wanetta soils have argillic horizons and are nonskeletal.  Shingle soils are shallow to weakly consolidated bedrock."
