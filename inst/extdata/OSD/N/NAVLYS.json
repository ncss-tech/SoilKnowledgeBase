The thickness of the loess is more than 60 inches (102 cm). The particle-size control section averages between 25 and 35 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has properties as follows: Hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 (5 or 6 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4. It is commonly silty clay loam, but some pedons are silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. A BE horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Redox features have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y and have value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. The upper 10 inches (25 cm) of the argillic horizon does not have redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less. Mottles with chroma of 2 are in the middle and lower parts of the control section in some pedons where the soil formed in deoxidized loess. The Bt horizon typically is silty clay loam, but some pedons have silt loam subhorizons. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline. The BC or BCk horizons in some pedons contain carbonates.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6."

Bertrand, Camden, Jackson, Rush, St. Charles and Thebes soils contain more sand and are often stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Blackhammer soils have sola more than 60 inches (152 cm) thick and have texture and color stratified 2Bt horizons. Dodge, Flagg, Piscasaw, and Russell soils contain more sand and rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Dubuque, Knowles and La Farge soils have bedrock within depths of 40 inches (102 cm). Fayette soils lack redox depletions in the upper 3/4 of the series control section and staturation within 6 feet (183 cm). Greenridge and Lambeau soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 45 to 80 inches (114 to 203 cm). Hackers soils contain redder hue in at least part of the series control section. Jemerson soils formed in silty alluvium, with more than 10 percent sand in at least some part of the series control section. Lomira soils formed in less than 38 inches of loess over till and have more than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Martinsburg soils have thicker sola and A horizons. Menfro and Palermo soils are in warmer temperature and greater precipitation regimes and do not have carbonates above a depth of 40 inches (102 cm). Middletown, Ridgway, Rozetta and Ruma soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 40 inches (102 cm). Palsgrove soils have higher average clay in the lower part of the series control section. Pepin soils average more than 35 percent clay and have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Seaton and Stookey soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have a coarse silt-fine silt ratio of 1.5 or more in the Bt horizon. Sylvan soils lack redox depletions in the upper 3/4 of the series control section, and saturation within 6 feet (183 cm). Yellowriver soils average more than 10 percent sand in the upper part of the series control section."

Mean annual temperature varies from 45 to 57 degrees F (7 to 14 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation varies from 32 to 45 inches (813 to 1143 mm). Frost free days range from 140 to 200 days.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were mapped as part of the Sylvan series. These are severely eroded areas of Sylvan soils. These soils are not saturated within a depth of 40 inches (102 cm) for 20 consecutive days or 30 total days in a normal year. Aquic conditions, watertable or redox features are below a depth of 4 feet (112 cm). Areas previously correlated as moderately well drained Sylvan soils will also be included with the Navlys series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of approximately 6 inches (15 cm), (A horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 6 to 31 inches (15 to 79 cm), (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
