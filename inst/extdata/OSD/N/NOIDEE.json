  "OVERVIEW": "The Noidee series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from basalt. Noidee soils are on plateaus and hills. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Noidee soils are on plateaus and hills. They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions. These soils formed in loess derived from mixed sources over residuum derived from basalt. These soils occur downwind of a salty playa (Summer Lake) and frequently receive new deposits of loess high in sodium salts. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,335 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 330 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Felcher soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, have cambic horizons, and a mesic temperature regime. Yankeewell soils are loamy and shallow to duripans."
