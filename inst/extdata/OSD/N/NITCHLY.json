  "OVERVIEW": "The Nitchly series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium weathered from limestone. The Nitchly soils are on mountain sideslopes. Permeability is moderately slow. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
