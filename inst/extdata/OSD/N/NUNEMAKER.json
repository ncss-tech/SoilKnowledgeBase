  "OVERVIEW": "The Nunemaker series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial deposits and in the underlying clayey till.  These soils are on glaciated till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
