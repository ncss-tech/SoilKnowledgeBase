  "OVERVIEW": "The Norrest series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in weathered from siltstone or soft shale on uplands.  These soils have moderately slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  It contains free carbonates throughout except for the surface inch or two under native vegetation in some pedons.  The soil is mildly or moderately alkaline throughout.  The A horizon may be darker than value of 3.5 moist, but is too thin to qualify as a mollic epipedon.  Some pedons have up to 25 percent by volume of pebbles and cobblestones on the surface and in the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam or cobbly silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay averaging between 35 and 45 percent clay.  It typically has few to common accumulation of carbonates.\nThe Bk horizon has the same range in color as the Bt horizon.  It is loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam and contains 1 to 15 percent by volume of fragments of siltstone.  It has common or many accumulations of carbonate as threads and fine masses.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that contains 5 to 35 percent by volume of fragments of siltstone and are clay loam or loam.\nThe Cr horizon is soft bedrock and can be readily dug with a spade.  Fractures extend into the siltstone forming prism like masses."

Agua Fria, Arp, and Panky soils have redder hue; in addition Agua Fria soils are underlain by gravelly alluvium at depths of 18 to 36 inches and Panky soils do not have Cr horizons within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Baca, Hesper, Manzanola, Thurlow, Ulm, and Wyarno soils do not have Cr horizons within depth of 40 inches.  Mughouse, Mughut, and Rencalson soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Renohill soils are leached of carbonates in the upper horizons."

These soils formed in residuum weathered from siltstone or soft shale, some are interbedded with sandstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 50 degreees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches."

Blackpipe soils have a mollic epipedon and are at heads of drainageways in shallow swales.  Cedar Butte soils are on lower nearly level flats, have natric horizons, and do not have bedrock within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Okreek soils are on the broader, more stable ridges and nearly level benches.  Imlay soils are on the more steeply sloping areas having sharp, convex surfaces. Okreek soils have mollic epipedons and Imlay soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 inches."
