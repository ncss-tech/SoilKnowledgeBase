  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 30 to 48 inches. Rock fragments of mixed lithology are dispersed throughout the profile and comprise 2 to 10 percent by volume. Shale rock fragments are a typical component. Soil saturation occurs above a depth of 40 inches for more than one month in 6 out of 10 years. Low chroma redoximorphic depletions do not occur in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 5. The Bt horizon has 18 to 30 percent clay and 30 to 50 percent fine sand and coarser. B/A clay ratios range from 1.2 to 1.9. It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. Clay films in the Bt horizon range from thin to thick and continuous to patchy. They commonly have value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3 with the lower value and chroma in the lower part of the argillic horizon. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BC or Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 6. It is fine sandy loam or loam. It has 15 to 27 percent clay and 30 to 55 percent sand. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The Beech series averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. The Blocher and Dormont series have less than 25 percent sand in the particle size control section. The Cadmus series has a lithologic discontinuity within the series control section and has a firm 2C horizon. The El Dara series has more than 55 percent sand in strata in the C horizon. The Funkstown series has moist chromas of 3 to 6 in the A horizon. The Glenhall series has greater than 55 percent sand in some part in the lower third of the series control section. The Keedysville series is not in the OSD file at this time. The Kensington series is not in the OSD file at this time. The Miami, Royerton and Wapahani series have dense till in the lower third of the series control section that has a bulk density of more than 1.75 g/cc. The Octagon series has more than 34 inches of rainfall (further differentiation is pending at this time). The Pevely series has sola terminated by a lithic contact within 20 to 40 inches. The Rainsville series have a mantle with less than 25 percent sand in the upper one quarter of the series control section. The Rawson series has more than 35 percent clay in the lower third of the series control section. The Richland series have more tan 10 percent rock fragments in the lower one quarter of the series control section. The Shawtown series is not in the OSD file at this time. The Summitville series lacks free carbonates in the series control section. The Teegarden series is not in the OSD file at this time. The Tulip series is not in the OSD file at this time."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane to slight convex slopes with gradient of 1 to 3 percent on moraines. The Nessel soils formed in calcareous glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 to 32 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 120 to 170 days. Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,300 feet above sea level."

The very poorly drained Glencoe soils are in depressions. The poorly drained Cordova, Dundas, and Hamel soils are in nearly level positions and drainageways. The well drained Angus, Hayden and Lester soils are on more sloping terrain."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 6 inches to 38 inches (Bt horizons) Oxyaquic subgroup based on soil saturation above a depth of 40 inches.\nThe Nessel series was previously classified as Glossaquic Hapludalfs. However, due to more investigations, it was noted that this series does not typically have a glossic horizon and is being reclassified as Oxyaquic Hapludalfs. Type Location was moved within Wright County.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 821 for results of some laboratory data.
