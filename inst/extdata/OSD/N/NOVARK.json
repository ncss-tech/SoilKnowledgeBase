  "OVERVIEW": "The Novark series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over glacial outwash and alluvium.  Novark soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature ia about 50 degrees F.",

Novark soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches from about May 1 to October 1.  Depth to contrasting textures ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  This horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe 2C horizon is dominated by dark colored basaltic sand.  It is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand."
