Novark soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches from about May 1 to October 1.  Depth to contrasting textures ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  This horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe 2C horizon is dominated by dark colored basaltic sand.  It is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand."

Ephrata soils are coarse, loamy in the upper part of the particle size control section and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the lower part.  Sagemoor, Shano, and Warden soils lack strongly contrasting sandy material in the particle size control section."

The climate is arid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 75 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 to 53 degrees F.
