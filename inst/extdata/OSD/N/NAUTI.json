  "OVERVIEW": "The Nauti series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in materials weathered from dioritic rock. Nauti soils are on side slopes interfluves on hills and mountains on islands. Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 355 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 21 degrees C (69 degrees F).",
