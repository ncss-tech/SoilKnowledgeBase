  "OVERVIEW": "The Nighthawk series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till of mixed mineralogy over calcareous metasediments.  These soils are on glaciated foothills and low glaciated mountains.  Slopes are 3 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
