  "OVERVIEW": "The Nikishka series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a thin layer of ash-influenced loess overlying glaciofluvial deposits.  Nikishka soils are on outwash plains, stream escarpments, and moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 19 inches.",

There is less than 15 percent gravel in the loess mantle.  The lower part of the control section has 50 to 70 percent coarse fragments with 10 to 15 percent cobbles, and 40 to 55 percent gravel.  The weighted average coarse fragment content of the control section is greater than 35 percent.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from slightly to extremely acid.\nThe E horizon is absent in some profiles.\nThe Bs horizons have hue ranging from 2.5YR to 10YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 2 to 6."

Soldotna soils occur on similar landforms and have loess mantles thicker than 15 inches.  Salamatof soils occur in muskegs and are organic soils."
