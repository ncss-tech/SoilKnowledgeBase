There is less than 15 percent gravel in the loess mantle.  The lower part of the control section has 50 to 70 percent coarse fragments with 10 to 15 percent cobbles, and 40 to 55 percent gravel.  The weighted average coarse fragment content of the control section is greater than 35 percent.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from slightly to extremely acid.\nThe E horizon is absent in some profiles.\nThe Bs horizons have hue ranging from 2.5YR to 10YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 2 to 6."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Nikishka soils occur on very gravelly moraines, stream escarpments, and outwash plains.  The soils formed in a thin layer of eolian silt loam and volcanic ash overlying coarse textured glaciofluvial material.  The climate is maritime transitional.  Mean annual air temperatures range from 33 to 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 22 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent."

Kalifonsky soils occur in depressions and are poorly drained. Naptowne soils occur on similar landforms and are non-skeletal. Soldotna soils occur on similar landforms and have loess mantles thicker than 15 inches.  Salamatof soils occur in muskegs and are organic soils."
