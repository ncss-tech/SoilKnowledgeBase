  "OVERVIEW": "The Narbaitz series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on high terraces. These soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. Slope ranges from 5 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 10 inches, the mean annual temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 230 to 270 days.",
