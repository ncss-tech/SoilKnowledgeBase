  "OVERVIEW": "The Norwest series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains.  They formed in loamy calcareous alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.) at the type location.",
