It is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand and is gravelly in some pedons. By volume, the A horizon is 0 to 20 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Reaction in 1:1 water ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has moist color of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is stratified fine sand, sand, or coarse sand and is gravelly in some pedons. Pebble content ranges from 0 to 25 percent by volume. Cobble content ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume. Coarse fragments average less than 35 percent by volume within the particle-size control section. Reaction in 1:1 water ranges from mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline."
