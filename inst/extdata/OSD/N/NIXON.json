  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 45 inches.  The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Coarse fragments range from less than 5 percent to 35 percent in strata.  The highest concentrations are typically in the surface horizon or the strata.  Coarse fragments are dominantly pebbles or cobblestones composed of quartz, quartzite, sandstone, or shale.  Most pedons contain some basalt, diabase, or granitic gneiss pebbles or cobblestones also.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A1 or Ap horizons have hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 and chromas of 1 through 4.  Some pedons have an A3 horizon that has hues of 5YR to 10YR, values and chroma or 4 through 6.  The texture is sandy loam, loam or gravelly equivalents.\nThe B horizons have hues of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, values of 3 through 5 and chromas of 4 through 6.  The texture is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or gravelly analogues.  Weighted average clay content for the particle size control section is 18 to 25 percent.  The evidence of illuviation of clay ranges from thin to thick, patchy or nearly continuous, clay films on peds to bridging between grains.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.\nThe C horizons have hues of 2.5YR to 10YR, values and chromas of 3 through 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loamy sand or sandy loam.  The C horizons are massive or single grained.  Most pedons contain one or more gravelly or cobbly strata."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Jefferson, Lily, Lonewood, Marr, Sassafras, and Sunnyside.  Jefferson, Lonewood, Marr, Riney Sassafras and Sunnyside all lack obvious red shale detrital components in the coarse fragments and fine earth fraction.  In addition Jefferson soils contain sandstone fragments and flagstones.  The sand fraction of Marr soils is poorly graded, it is almost exclusively fine and very fine sand.  Lily soils are 20 to 40 inches to sandstone bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nixon soils are nearly level to gently sloping.  They have formed in acid coarse textured sediments which were derived from a mixing of red shale and siliceous coastal plain materials.  The average temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.; precipitation is 40 to 48 inches; frost free days range from 160 to 190 per year."
