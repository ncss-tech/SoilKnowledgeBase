These soils formed in a mixture of loess and material weathered from granite, quartzite, gneiss or schist with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. Elevations are 2,700 to 4,200 feet (823 to 1280 meters).  The average annual temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F., with an average annual precipitation of 30 to 45 inches (762 to 1143 mm).  The frost-free period ranges from 80 to 130 days."
