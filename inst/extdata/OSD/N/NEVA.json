  "OVERVIEW": "The Neva series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes and ridges.  They formed in a mixture of loess and material weathered from granite, gneiss, quartzite or schist with a thin mantle of volcanic ash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slope ranges from 5 to 70 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",
