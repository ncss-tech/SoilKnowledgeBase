  "STATES": "AZ,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nalcase series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian sand, alluvium and residuum derived from Navajo sandstone. These soils are on sand sheets and dunes on structural benches, buttes, and mesas with slopes of 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is 11 inches (279 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F (10.0 degrees F).",
