  "OVERVIEW": "The Naughton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from shale. These soils are on hillslopes and cuestas. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.2 degrees C.",
