Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 80 to 140 days. Elevation is 183 to 274 meters (600 to 900 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Algonquin and the poorly drained Springport are closely associated with the Negwegon soils in a drainage sequence. They are on lower positions on the landscape. The well drained Mongo soils are on steeper slopes of dissected lake plains."
