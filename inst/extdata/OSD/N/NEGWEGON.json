  "OVERVIEW": "The Negwegon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in silty and clayey lacustrine deposits on dissected lake plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
