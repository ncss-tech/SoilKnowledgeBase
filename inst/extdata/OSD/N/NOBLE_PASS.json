Dalvord soils have granitic parent materials. Haleburu and Upspring soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the control section. Hindu soils have 20 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalence and formed from calcareous sedimentary bedrock. Paintrocks soils have granitic parent materials and 1 to 3 inches deep to paralithic contact or bedrock. Sutra soils have 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalence and formed from limestone bedrock. Terlingua soils have a paralithic contact at 4 to 14 inches which makes it a typic torriorthents and not lithic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
