  "OVERVIEW": "The Nebgen series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum from Cambrian age sandstone bedrock. These soils occur on backslopes, shoulders and summits of ridges. Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 in).",
