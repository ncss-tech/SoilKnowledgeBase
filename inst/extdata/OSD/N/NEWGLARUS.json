  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact with  dolomite ranges from 40 to 60 inches.   The loess thickness ranges from 12 to 35 inches.  Volume of chert gravel and dolostone channers and flagstones ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loess, 3 to 35 percent chert gravel and dolostone channers and 0 to 15 percent dolostone flagstones in the pedisediment, and 35 to 70 percent dolostone channers and flagstones in the residuum.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have A horizons with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where the value is 3, it is less than 6 inches thick or the dry color value is 6 or more. Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have E horizons with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture  is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma is 3 to 6.   Texture is silty clay, clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, or the channery or flaggy analogs. Clay content ranges from  35 to 65 percent.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The 3Bt horizon has distinctive coatings with value of 3 and chroma of 2 just above the contact with the dolomite.  Texture is loam or sandy loam or the very channery, very flaggy, extremely channery, extremely flaggy analogs. ."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  NewGlarus soils typically are on ridgetops and side slopes in undulating or rolling landscape underlain by dolostone, but some pedons are on bench terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in 12 to 35 inches of loess and the underlying clayey pedisediment and in the loamy residuum weathered from the underlying dolostone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 37 inchesMean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F."

Dodgeville soils are on similar topography and have a mollic epipedon.  Dubuque soils are associated in landscapes where the clayey residuum is less than 6 inches thick.  Fivepoints soils are on similar landscapes, but have thinner loess deposits and lithic contacts within depths of 40 inches.  Palsgrove soils are on sites in similar geographic positions where the loess deposits are thicker."

    "content": "REMARKS:  NewGlarus soils were at one time included with the Dubuque soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - zone from 13 to 45 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2, 3Bt3 horizons); other features - strongly contrasting particle-size class (absolute difference of 25 percent clay).\nProfiles that have the thicker loess deposits may classify as fine-silty instead of fine-silty over clayey.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
