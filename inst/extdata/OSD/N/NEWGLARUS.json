  "OVERVIEW": "The NewGlarus series consists of well drained soils deep to dolostone or other limestone.  These upland and terrace soils formed in loess and clayey pedisediment and in loamy residuum weathered from the underlying  dolostone.  Permeability is moderate in the loess, slow in the clayey pedisediment, moderate  in the loamy  residuum, and slow to moderate in the dolostone.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Dodgeville soils are on similar topography and have a mollic epipedon.  Dubuque soils are associated in landscapes where the clayey residuum is less than 6 inches thick.  Fivepoints soils are on similar landscapes, but have thinner loess deposits and lithic contacts within depths of 40 inches.  Palsgrove soils are on sites in similar geographic positions where the loess deposits are thicker."
