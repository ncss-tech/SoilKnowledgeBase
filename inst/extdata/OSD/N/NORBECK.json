Cordeston (micaceous) and Virkula soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and are below Norbeck soils on the landscape.  Pactola soils formed in residuum or colluvium derived from metamorphic rocks (primarily schist and slate), contain flat rock fragments (channers and flagstones), and typically contain less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand in the fine-earth fraction.  They occur on similar landscape positions."
