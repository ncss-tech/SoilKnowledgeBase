  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 74 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry and are not moist for as long as 60 consecutive days.  The soil is calcareous throughout.  Organic matter content is less than 0.5 percent and decreases irregularly with depth.  Thickness of the sandy material overlying the clayey material is 14 to 36 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent by volume in the surface horizon.\nThe C1 horizon is very pale brown, pale brown, light yellowish brown, light brown or pink (10YR 7/3, 7/4, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 6/4, 7/4) stratified gravelly sand, sand or loamy sand.\nThe IIC2 horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown, very pale brown, light brown, pink, light reddish brown (10YR 6/3, 6/4 7/3, 7/4; 7.5YR 6/4, 7/4; 5YR 6/3, 6/4) clay, silty clay or clay loam with more than 35 percent clay.  Vertical cracks in the clayey strata are often filled with sandy material and crack surfaces may have yellowish red stains.  The IIC horizon ranges from non-saline to strongly saline."

Carrizo soils have over 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Gilman soils have less than 18 percent clay to a depth of 40 inches.  Holtville soils are clayey in the upper part and are sandy in the lower part of the control section.  Imperial soils are clayey throughout to a depth of 40 inches.  Meloland soils are coarse-loamy over clayey in the control section.  Rosamond soils are fine-loamy throughout the control section and have mean soil temperature less than 72 degrees F.  Rositas soils are sandy throughout to a depth of 40 inches or more,"

They formed in coarse mixed alluvium overlying fine alluvium at depths of less than 36 inches.   Slopes are usually less than 1 percent but range up to 5 percent.  Average annual precipitation is less than 4 inches.  The average January temperature is about 50 degrees F., average July temperature is about 90 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 300 days."
