  "STATES": "NM,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nepalto series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils. These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from sandstone and shale on alluvial fans and drainageways on structural benches. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

All of the above soils have 10YR hue or yellower. Bluewing, Gynelle, and Wardenot soils have visible carbonates accumulation in the series control section. Inmo, Izo, and Leo soils are stratified throughout the profile. Willwood soils contain 0 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium and neutral hue in the soil matrix. Itme soils have more than 50 percent rock fragments in the 2 to 5 millimeter size fragments and are moist in the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days following summer convection storms between July and October."
