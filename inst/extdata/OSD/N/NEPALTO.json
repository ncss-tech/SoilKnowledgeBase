All of the above soils have 10YR hue or yellower. Bluewing, Gynelle, and Wardenot soils have visible carbonates accumulation in the series control section. Inmo, Izo, and Leo soils are stratified throughout the profile. Willwood soils contain 0 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium and neutral hue in the soil matrix. Itme soils have more than 50 percent rock fragments in the 2 to 5 millimeter size fragments and are moist in the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days following summer convection storms between July and October."

Slope gradients are 1 to 8 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from sandstone and shale. The climate is arid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 5 to 10 inches. The mean annual temperature is 52 to 59 degrees F, and the freeze-free period ranges from 150 to 195 days."
