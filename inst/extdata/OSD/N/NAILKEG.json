Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is very channery loam with l0 to 25 percent clay.  It has 35 to 50 percent channers and 0 to 5 percent flagstones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very channery loam, very channery clay loam, or extremely channery loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  It has 25 to 50 percent channers and 10 to 15 percent flagstones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nailkeg soils occur on metastable broad ridgetops and slump benches, and on metastable to active side slopes of mountains.   Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist or phyllite rock types of the Colebrooke Schist Formation.  Elevations are 200 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."
