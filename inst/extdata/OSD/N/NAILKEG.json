  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nailkeg series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist or phyllite rock types.  Nailkeg soils are on broad ridgetops and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is very channery loam with l0 to 25 percent clay.  It has 35 to 50 percent channers and 0 to 5 percent flagstones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very channery loam, very channery clay loam, or extremely channery loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  It has 25 to 50 percent channers and 10 to 15 percent flagstones."

The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.
