  "OVERVIEW": "The Nahda series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, well drained soils formed in fan alluvium derived dominantly from acid igneous and metamorphic rock.  Nahda soils are on erosional fan terraces with slopes of 1 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 68 degrees F.",
