These soils are on all hillslope components of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to very steep `a`a flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 380 and 760 millimeters (15 to 30 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from January through July.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1520 to 1780 millimeters (60 to 70 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 17 to 21 degrees C (63 to 70 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
