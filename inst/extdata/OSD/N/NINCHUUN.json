Bradway and Tanana soils have substantial mica content and lack coarse fragments in the control section. Chetlake soils have cobbles and stones. Tanana soils also contain lenses of fine sand or fine sandy loam. Tetlin series soils formed in micaceous loess on bedrock cored hills and lack coarse fragments in the control section."
