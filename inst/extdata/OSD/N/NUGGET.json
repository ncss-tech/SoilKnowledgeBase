  "OVERVIEW": "The Nugget series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from granite, granodiorite, and quartzite. Nugget soils are on hills and mountains.  Slope ranges from 3 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
