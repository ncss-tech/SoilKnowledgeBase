  "OVERVIEW": "The Nations series consists of moderately deep and well drained soils formed from recent eolian material and sandy and loamy sediments.  Permeability is moderately slow above the very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon and rapid below the petrocalcic horizon.  A cemented pan at about 25 inches underlies these soils.  These soils are on fan remnants and wide alluvial flats on basins floors between mountain ranges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

The climate is arid with average annual rainfall of 8 to 11 inches.  Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 67 degrees F.
