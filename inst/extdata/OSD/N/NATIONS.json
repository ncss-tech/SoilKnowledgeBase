Slopes are mostly less than 3 percent. The regolith consists of very thick sandy to loamy bolson sediments many hundred feet deep. Elevations range from 3,000 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is arid with average annual rainfall of 8 to 11 inches.  Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 200 to 240 days."
