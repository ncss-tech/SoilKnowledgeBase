  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Navajo soils are on alluvial fans, flood plains, and playas and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations are 4,500 to 6,800 feet.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium from basalt, shale, pyroclastics and sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches occurring as thunderstorms in summer and as gentle rain or snow in winter.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."
