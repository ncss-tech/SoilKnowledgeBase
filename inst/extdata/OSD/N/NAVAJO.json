  "OVERVIEW": "The Navajo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Navajo soils are on flood plains, alluvial fans and playas.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The soils formed in mixed alluvium from basalt, shale, pyroclastics and sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches occurring as thunderstorms in summer and as gentle rain or snow in winter.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."
