Schoer soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and have sandy-skeletal material within depths of 100 cm.  Zymans soils have 45 to 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section and do not have sandy loam C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Northmore soils are on fan remnants that are somewhat dissected by intermittent drainageways.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks such as granodiorite and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,680 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 110 days."
