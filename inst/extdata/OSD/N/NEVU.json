The soils formed in gravelly alluvium primarily from welded tuff with some limestone. The climate is cool, continental with a mean annual precipitation of 250 to 300 mm, with much of it coming as snow and as periodic summer thunderstorms. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C and the frost-free season is about 90 to 120 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly classified as having a frigid temperature regime, but local temperature data supports a mesic soil temperature. Changed to mesic temperature in October 2002. Moved the type location and changed to ashy, glassy, Vitritorrandic in June 2005.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to  28 cm (A and Bt horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 69 cm (Bt, Btk, and Btqk horizons).\nDuripan (indurated) - The zone from 69 to 91 cm (Bqkm horizon).\nVitritorrandic feature - The zone from 13 to 63 cm with 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass in the 0.02 to 2 mm fraction and averages 0.02 to 0.04 percent Al plus 1/2Fe, extracted by ammonium oxalate (Bt, Btk, and upper part of the Btqk horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 63 cm (Bt, Btk, and upper part of the Btqk horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
