  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Nortonville soils are calcareous in the A and Ccs horizons but grade to noncalcareous C horizons at depths of less than 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 10 to 35 percent in the upper part of the control section, and there are some subhorizons more than 4 inches thick above a depth of 20 inches that exceed 15 percent.  Exchangeable sodium decreases as depth increases.  Depth to the gypsic horizon ranges from 8 to 24 inches.  Depth to skeletal materials ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The control section is usually loam or clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 50 percent sand with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline in the upper part of the C horizon but grades to mildly or moderately alkaline in the lower part.  A gypsic horizon occurs in the upper part of the C horizon, but content of calcium sulfate decreases as depth increases."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Nortonville soils are on flood plains and low alluvial fans.  Slope gradients range from 0 to about 6 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial parent materials.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer."
