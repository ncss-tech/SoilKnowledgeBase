Other small areas have been planted to pine, or remain in their native vegetation. The overstory in most wooded areas consists of white oak, scarlet oak, red oak, eastern white pine, red maple, sugar maple, hickory, pitch pine, Virginia pine, and yellow-poplar. The understory contains mountain laurel, flowering dogwood, eastern white pine, cedar, honeysuckle, blackberry, raspberry, blueberry, sourwood, sassafras, Virginia creeper, greenbrier, and young hardwoods."
