  "OVERVIEW": "The Northpoint series consists of shallow to fractured hard bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on glaciated mountain slopes and mountain headwalls.  Slopes are 40 to 100 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 90 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 12 to 25 percent for air dried samples.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  It has 15 bar water of 15 to 25 percent.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam or extremely cobbly medial sandy loam.  It has 15 bar of 12 to 15 percent in a layer 6 to 12 inches thick (vitric).  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.
