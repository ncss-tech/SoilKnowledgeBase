  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Newbar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rocks on low terraces and gravel bars on mountain valley floors. Newbar soils are saturated with flowing water that fluctuates in depth with stream flow.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature about 44 degrees F.",
