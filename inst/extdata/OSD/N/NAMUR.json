Cracks are more than 10 cm (4 inches) apart and commonly are 0.6 to 3.0 meters (2 to 10 feet) apart. These cracks are filled with soil (residuum, loess, or till) but occupy less than 5 percent of the volume."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Namur soils are on glaciated karst uplands underlain by dolostone. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. These soils formed in a very thin silty or loamy mantle over the bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 838 mm (28 to 33 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 3.9 to 7.2 degrees C (39 to 45 degrees F). The frost-free period ranges from about 80 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 187 to 427 meters (600 to 1400 feet)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Namur soils are associated with the Kolberg, Ruse, and Summerville soils. The well drained Kolberg soils are nearby where the soil has more clay and is moderately deep to dolostone. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Ruse soils are nearby in depressions where the soil is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick to dolomite. The well drained Summerville soils are nearby in landscape positions similar to those of Namur soils where the soil is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick to dolostone."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Excessively drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the silty or loamy mantle and moderately low very high (0.42 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the dolostone, depending on fracturing. Permeability is moderate in the silty or loamy mantle and slow to rapid in the dolostone, depending on fracturing."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are used for pastureland. Some areas are used for cropland or orchards. Where orchards are grown, the soil's effective depth often has been increased by blasting to a depth of several meters (feet). Native vegetation is sparse deciduous and coniferous forest with grassy understory."
