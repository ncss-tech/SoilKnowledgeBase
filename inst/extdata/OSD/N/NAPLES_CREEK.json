  "OVERVIEW": "The Naples Creek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on floodplains. They formed in nearly level, silty alluvial deposits that occasionally overlie lacustrine sediments. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low through high throughout the mineral soil. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 8.8 degrees C (47.8 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 88 centimeters (34.6 inches).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 61.0 through 198.1 cm (24 through 78 inches). Rock fragments generally are less than 5 percent throughout. Depth to bedrock is more than 152 centimeters (60 inches). Reaction ranges from strongly acid through moderately alkaline. Some pedons may have carbonates below 102 centimeters (40 inches).\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5 Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 5. The texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam. Structure is fine or medium subangular blocky or granular.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3. The texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Structure is subangular blocky or granular.\nSome pedons have a BC or C with colors and textures similar to the B horizon. In areas where this soil overlies lacustrine deposits, textures in the BC or C horizon may range to silty clay, but the weighted average of clay in the particle size control section is from 18 through 34 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Naples Creek soils are level and nearly level soils on flood plains along low gradient streams. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent. The soils formed in recent alluvium derived from glaciated uplands predominantly of shale, siltstone and limestone. In some valleys the silty alluvium overlies lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 79 through 112 centimeters (31 through 44 inches), mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.3 degrees through 9.1 degrees C (45 degrees through 48.4 degrees F), and growing season ranges from 107 through 171 days."

The Ontario soils are on nearby till mantled uplands, the Palmyra soils are on nearby outwash deposits, and the Schoharie and Odesssa soils are on nearby glacial lacustrine deposits. Guyanoga (T) soils are located on higher alluvial fan landscapes adjacent to the Naples Creek soils."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 through 23 centimeters (0.0 through 9.1 inches) (Ap horizon).\n(2.) Cambic epipedon - the zone from 23 through 183 centimeters (23 through 72 inches) (Bw, Bg1, and Bg2  horizons).\n(3.) Udic soil moisture regime.\n(4.) Pedon originally described in English units, then converted to metric units."
