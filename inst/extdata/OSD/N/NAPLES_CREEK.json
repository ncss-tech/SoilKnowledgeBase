  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 61.0 through 198.1 cm (24 through 78 inches). Rock fragments generally are less than 5 percent throughout. Depth to bedrock is more than 152 centimeters (60 inches). Reaction ranges from strongly acid through moderately alkaline. Some pedons may have carbonates below 102 centimeters (40 inches).\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5 Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 5. The texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam. Structure is fine or medium subangular blocky or granular.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3. The texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Structure is subangular blocky or granular.\nSome pedons have a BC or C with colors and textures similar to the B horizon. In areas where this soil overlies lacustrine deposits, textures in the BC or C horizon may range to silty clay, but the weighted average of clay in the particle size control section is from 18 through 34 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Newark series is the only soil in the same family. Newark soils are formed from alluvial materials derived from residual soils, not till.\nThe Holderton and Wakeville series are similar soils in related families. Holderton soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Wakeville soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Naples Creek soils are level and nearly level soils on flood plains along low gradient streams. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent. The soils formed in recent alluvium derived from glaciated uplands predominantly of shale, siltstone and limestone. In some valleys the silty alluvium overlies lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 79 through 112 centimeters (31 through 44 inches), mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.3 degrees through 9.1 degrees C (45 degrees through 48.4 degrees F), and growing season ranges from 107 through 171 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Naples Creek soils are the somewhat poorly drained member of a drainage sequence which includes the well drained Geneseo, moderately well drained Hemlock, and poorly and very poorly drained Wayland soils. The Ontario soils are on nearby till mantled uplands, the Palmyra soils are on nearby outwash deposits, and the Schoharie and Odesssa soils are on nearby glacial lacustrine deposits. Guyanoga (T) soils are located on higher alluvial fan landscapes adjacent to the Naples Creek soils."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Naples Creek series was set up to cover the fine-silty somewhat poorly drained floodplain soils not represented by any other series in MLRA's 101 and 140.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n(1.) Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 through 23 centimeters (0.0 through 9.1 inches) (Ap horizon).\n(2.) Cambic epipedon - the zone from 23 through 183 centimeters (23 through 72 inches) (Bw, Bg1, and Bg2  horizons).\n(3.) Udic soil moisture regime.\n(4.) Pedon originally described in English units, then converted to metric units.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the typical pedon is available through the NSSC lab, sample number S10NY123011.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
