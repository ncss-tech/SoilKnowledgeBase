Juva soils have hue of 10YR or yellower.  Glenton, Ives and Juva soils are finely stratified in the control section and have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Ives and Thoroughfare soils are strongly calcareous in the control section.  Also, Thoroughfare soils have a fine sandy loam series control section.  Vanderhoff soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Cirac and Juva soils are strongly to very strongly alkaline and have an SAR of greater than 13 and salts greater than 16 mmhos in some part of the series control section. Eghelm soils have more than 50 percent sand. Glenton soils, typically, have soil temperatures of 47 to 51 degrees F., and are intermittently moist during April, May and June. Yelives soils have yellower (2.5Y) hue."
