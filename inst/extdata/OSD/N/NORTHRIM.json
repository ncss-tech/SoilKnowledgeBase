  "OVERVIEW": "The Northrim series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Northrim soils are on hills, ridges, and in canyons.  Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

Potential competitors still classified as Eutroboralfs are Eaglecreek, Fairport, Haugan, and Jemez series. Alderon, Allens Park, Bayerton, Belltower, Eaglecreek, Elmark, Fairport, Jemco, Jemez, Lumpgulch, Rule and Shoemaker soils are moderately deep. Elbeth soils are weathered from schist and granite and have albic horizons. Elbuck soils receive 24 to 26 inches of precipitation. Haugan soils have visible secondary carbonates. Hoyt soils are moist in the spring and have more influence from granite and till material. Kunz soils are dry in any part of the moisture control section for 90 or more cumulative days in most years.  Losindios soils contain more than 50 percent sand in the argillic horizon.  Plome soils are redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Sweetwater soils have glossic horizons, are more moist in the spring, and formed in colluvium from volcanic mudflow breccia. Tunitcha soils have a C horizon with less than 15 percent clay."
