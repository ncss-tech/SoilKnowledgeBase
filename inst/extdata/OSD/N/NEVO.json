  "OVERVIEW": "Nevo series consists of very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in loess and residuum from basalt on hillslopes, ridgetops and benches. Slopes are 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are dry in all parts above the lithic contact more than half of the time that the soil temperature is above 40 degrees F. The particle-size control section averages 25 to 33 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 40 to 75 percent basalt fragments by volume. Solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact ranges from 5 to 10 inches. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has  value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and  chroma of 2 or 3 moist. Texture is very cobbly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. Texture is very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly loam."

Atlow soils are 14 to 20 inches deep and are moderately to strongly alkaline in the argillic horizon. Boomstick soils are 14 to 20 inches deep and are dominantly channers and flagstones in the profile. Checkett soils are moderately or strongly alkaline throughout and are 14 to 19 inches deep. Cottle soils have secondary carbonates in the lower argillic horizon. Fortyday soils are 14 to 20 inches to bedrock and are 18 to 25 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Gabbvally soils are 15 to 25 percent clay in the control section. Hooplite soils are 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have slight or strong effervescence in the argillic horizon. Olac and Soughe soils lack silica coatings on fracture planes. Old camp soils have carbonates on coarse fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Phliss soils are moderately alkaline throughout and effervescence increases with depth. Rowel soils have an abrupt textural change and an argillic horizon with 40 to 55 percent clay. Sedsked soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to lithic contact (metasedimentary bedrock) and have a pscs dominated by sedimentary rock fragments.  Stewval soils are calcareous throughout. Thike soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon."
