  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "MAA-KDV",
  "REVDATE": "02/2003",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Newcomer series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess and residuum from sandstone interbedded with shale or in residuum.  These soils are on uplands and have slope gradients of 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to soft sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Hard bedrock is at a depth greater than 40 inches.  In some pedons there are up to 15 percent coarse fragments of sandstone throughout the B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has color value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam.  Reaction commonly is moderately acid to neutral, but includes slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have an E or BE horizon.\nThe Bt and 2Bt horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  They are silt loam, loam or clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 8.  It typically is loam, but includes sandy clay loam, sandy loam, and clay loam.  This horizon has few to many clay flows and clay pockets.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  Some pedons have a 2C horizon."
