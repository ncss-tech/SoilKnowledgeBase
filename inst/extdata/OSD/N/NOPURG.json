  "OVERVIEW": "The Nopurg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed metamorphic and sedimentary rocks.  Nopurg soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 10 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
