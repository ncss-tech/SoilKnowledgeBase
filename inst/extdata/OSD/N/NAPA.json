  "OVERVIEW": "The Napa series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These soils occur on flood plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 690 millimeters (27 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F)at the type location.",
