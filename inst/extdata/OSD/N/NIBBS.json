  "OVERVIEW": "The Nibbs series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately\npermeable soils on coalesced fan terraces.  They formed in mixed\nalluvium of quartz latite and quartzite with some loess influence.\nSlope ranges from 2 to 8 percent.  The average annual temperature is\nabout 46 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 11\ninches.",
