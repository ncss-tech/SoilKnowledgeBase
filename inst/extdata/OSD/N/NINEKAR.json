    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.   The mean annual soil temperature varies from 51 to 57 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section (5 to 14 inches) is dry throughout from June 1 thru November 1 (153 days).  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from April 15 thru November 15.  Cracks 4 cm wide extend from the top of the argillic to about 0.5 cm wide at 23 inches.  The cracks do not extend to the surface.  Rock fragments on the surface, mostly stones and cobbles, range from 10 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2 or 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/2 or 4/2.  It is loam or silt loam modified by 20 to 50 percent cobbles and stones.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  The epipedon has dry value of 6 or has moist value or chroma of 4 or is too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 7/6, 6/4, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4; 5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4.

Reaction ranges from neutral thru moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in residuum from hard basalt, andesite, or tuff bedrock.  Small amounts of volcanic ash is present in some pedons.  The climate is cool semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Snowfall is 30 to 60 inches.  Average January temperature is 27 degrees F.; average July temperature is 67 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 70 to 80 days."
