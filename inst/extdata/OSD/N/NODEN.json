  "STATES": "CO,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Noden series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from fine-grained sandstone and occasionally in slide deposits. They occur on dissected fan aprons, terraces, pediments, and rotational slides. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
