The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  Coarse fragments are typically absent but range from 0 to 10 percent angular gravel.  These soils are noncalcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6  dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

The Ascalon, Asparas, Capulin, Datil, Featherlegs, Harlan, Moskee, Palmer Canyon, Recluse, Satanta, Shalona, Sugardee, Wages, and Wolf series have continuous horizons of carbonate accumulation.  The Bresser and Lavate soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the Bt horizon. The Cedak, Chacuaco, Dagflat, Hargreave, Hemingford, Hirac, Kirtley, Rosebud, and Ryegate soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Critchell and Lorac soils contain 10 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Noden soils are on dissected fan aprons, pediments, and terraces.  They formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from noncalcareous fine-grained sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 3,500 to 5,600 feet in Wyoming and up to 7,000 feet in Colorado.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and ranges from 12 to 19 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F. and ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 110 to 135 days."
