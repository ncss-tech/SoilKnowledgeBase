  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The organic material extends to a depth of 40 to 130 centimeters. Woody fragments, consisting of twigs, branches, logs, or stumps, commonly occur throughout the organic soil materials and average from 2 to 15 percent by volume in the control section. Fragments range in size from 20 to 300 millimeters in diameter, and in lieu textures include woody modifiers. The reaction of the organic material ranges from ultra acid to slightly alkaline. The reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.  Some pedons have free carbonates in the mineral soil material.\nThe surface tier has hue of 10YR to 5YR, or is neutral; value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 6. It is peat, mucky peat, or muck (fibric, hemic, or sapric materials). The surface tier is massive or has weak or medium, coarse to fine granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe subsurface tier has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, or is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4. It is commonly massive, but some pedons have granular, weak coarse blocky or thick platy structure. It is typically muck (sapric materials), but some pedons have thin layers of mucky peat (hemic materials).\nThe bottom tier, where present, has characteristics similar to the subsurface tier.\nThe 2C or 2Cg horizon has a hue of 5YR to 5GY, or is neutral; value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. It is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or gravelly analogues of these textures. Rock fragments range in size from gravel to stones and from 0 to 30 percent by volume."

Klossner and Philbon soils have A horizons directly below the organic material. Linwood soils are moist for more than 60 cumulative days in any part of the upper 15 centimeters of the soil in a normal year. Palms soils formed primarily in herbaceous materials, lack woody fragments, and average less than 920 mm of precipitation annually. Medo soils have sandy textures in the lower part of the series control section. Shalcar soils have mean summer temperatures that average less than 18 degrees Celsius."

These soils formed in woody and herbaceous organic materials. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 7 to 13 degrees Celsius. The mean annual precipitation is 920 to 1800 millimeters. The frost-free period is 130 to 240 days."
