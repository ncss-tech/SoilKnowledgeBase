    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, except where limed. Nodules or fragments of ironstone range from 0 to 25 percent, by volume, in the A and B horizons. Few to common flakes of mica occur in the lower parts of some pedons.  The control section has an average clay content of 35 to 50 percent and an average silt content of less than 20 percent.  Plinthite ranges from 0 to 3 percent, by volume, in the Bt horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 1 through 5.  The horizon is less than 6 inches thick when moist color value is 3.  Texture is sand, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Some eroded pedons have a surface texture of sandy clay loam.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, and brown range from none to common.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have a thin sandy clay loam Bt1 horizon where the BE horizon is absent\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has the same range of colors as the upper part or there is no dominant matrix color and it is multicolored in shades of red, yellow, and brown and below a depth of 40 inches, gray.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, red, brown, and below a depth of 40 inches, gray range from common to many.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8 with redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray ranging from common to many; or there is no dominant color and is in shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray. Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Pockets and thin strata of loamy sand, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, and sandy clay occur in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6; or there is no dominant color and is multicolored shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray range from common to many.  It has the same texture range as the BC horizon."

Appling, Bethlehem, Cecil, Georgeville, Herndon, Hulett, Madison, Pacolet, Saw, and Wedowee series formed in residual parent material in the Piedmont. Nanford and Tarrus soils weathered from slate in the Carolina slate belt.  Tumbleton soils have more than 20 percent silt in the control section."
