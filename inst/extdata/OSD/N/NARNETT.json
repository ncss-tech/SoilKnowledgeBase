  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Narnett series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources, dominated by loess, with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  The Narnett soils are on stream terraces and mountain footslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
