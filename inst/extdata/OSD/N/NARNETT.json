    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Narnett soils are on old stream terraces and mountain footslopes.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources, dominated by loess, with a thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 5 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 3,200 to 4,400 feet.  The climate is cool and moist.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches; mean annual temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is 30 to 100 days (9 in 10 years to 1 in 10 years, respectively)."
