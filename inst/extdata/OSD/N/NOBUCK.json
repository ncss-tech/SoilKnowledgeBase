  "OVERVIEW": "The Nobuck series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  The Nobuck soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
