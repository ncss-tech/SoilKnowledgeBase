  "OVERVIEW": "The Norge series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable upland soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to sloping soils occur on flats and upper side slopes of upland terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in).",
