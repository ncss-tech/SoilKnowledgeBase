It has weak granular structure or is massive.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, and  chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is very or extremely gravelly.  This horizon is slightly to strongly acid in the upper part and moderately to slightly acid in the lower part.  It is massive or single grained.\nThe C1 and 2C horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is very gravelly, extremely gravelly or very cobbly.  It is slightly to strongly acid.  It is massive or single grained.\nThe 4Bwb horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, dry value of 6 or 7, and dry chroma of 3 or 4.
