These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 12 and 35 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days.  The particle-size control section averages more than 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry.    This horizon is moderately or strongly acid.  It has weak granular structure or is massive.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, and  chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is very or extremely gravelly.  This horizon is slightly to strongly acid in the upper part and moderately to slightly acid in the lower part.  It is massive or single grained.\nThe C1 and 2C horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is very gravelly, extremely gravelly or very cobbly.  It is slightly to strongly acid.  It is massive or single grained.\nThe 4Bwb horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, dry value of 6 or 7, and dry chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is gravelly, extremely gravelly or very cobbly.  It is slightly to strongly acid."
