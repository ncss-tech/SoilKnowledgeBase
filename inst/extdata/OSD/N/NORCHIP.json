Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm (60 in). Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent by volume in the horizons above the fragipan and from 15 to 50 percent in the Bx and C horizons.\nSome pedons may have an O horizon up to 7.5 cm (3 in) thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Some pedons have a mucky modifier. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral. Some pedons have an A horizon up to 15 cm (6 in) thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value or 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate angular blocky, subangular blocky, platy, or granular. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a Bg or Bw horizon in place of or in addition to the E horizon.\nThe Bx or 2Bx horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam. Structure is prismatic, blocky, or platy. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has weak subangular blocky or platy structure. Color and texture is similar to the Bx horizon.\nThe Cd or 2Cd horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam. It has plate-like divisions or is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral. Some pedons contain a C horizon with similar colors and textures to the Cd."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Camroden and Ontusia series are in the same family. Camroden soils are somewhat poorly drained and dominated by shale rock fragments and are in areas that dominantly have higher precipitation. Ontusia soils are somewhat poorly drained and are more acid in the Bx and C horizons.\nThe Dannemora, Marcy, and Trussel series are soils in related families. Dannemora soils are coarse-loamy. Marcy soils have chroma of 2 or less dominant throughout the profile. Trussel soils formed in colluvium derived from residual soil material, have more angular rock fragments, and a lower bulk density in the fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Norchip soils occupy nearly level areas or depressions on glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The parent material is usually a firm till derived mainly from sandstone, siltstone, and some shale. Surficial deposits of alluvium or colluvium up to 51 cm (20 in) thick are present in some pedons. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm (32 to 70 in) and the frost free days range from 110 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 1100 m (1394 to 3608 ft) above sea level."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The fine-loamy family classification of Norchip needs confirmation. More lab data is needed to confirm particle size family. The Aeric subgroup differs from that of the Chippewa, the mesic analog and should be investigated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in). (A, and Eg horizons).\n2. Fragipan - the zone from 41 to 163 cm (16 to 64 in). (Bx1 and Bx2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
