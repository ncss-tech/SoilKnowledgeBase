  "OVERVIEW": "The Norchip series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. These soils are in upland depressions and have a dense fragipan from 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 in). Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the fragipan in the mineral soil and low or moderately low in the fragipan and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1120 mm (44 in).",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Camroden and Ontusia series are in the same family. Camroden soils are somewhat poorly drained and dominated by shale rock fragments and are in areas that dominantly have higher precipitation. Ontusia soils are somewhat poorly drained and are more acid in the Bx and C horizons.\nThe Dannemora, Marcy, and Trussel series are soils in related families. Dannemora soils are coarse-loamy. Marcy soils have chroma of 2 or less dominant throughout the profile. Trussel soils formed in colluvium derived from residual soil material, have more angular rock fragments, and a lower bulk density in the fragipan."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm (32 to 70 in) and the frost free days range from 110 to 155 days.

The Aeric subgroup differs from that of the Chippewa, the mesic analog and should be investigated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 41 cm (0 to 16 in). (A, and Eg horizons).\n2. Fragipan - the zone from 41 to 163 cm (16 to 64 in).
