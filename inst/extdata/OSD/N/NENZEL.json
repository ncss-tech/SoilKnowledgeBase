  "STATES": "NE,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nenzel series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils that formed in mostly eolian sands on interdunes on sandhills. Some areas formed in alluvial sands on stream terraces on valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location.",
