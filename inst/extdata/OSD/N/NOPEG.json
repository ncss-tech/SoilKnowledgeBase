  "OVERVIEW": "The soils of the Nopeg series are shallow, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium from volcanic rocks over residuum from soft tuff. Nopeg soils are on rock pediments. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7.2 C.",
