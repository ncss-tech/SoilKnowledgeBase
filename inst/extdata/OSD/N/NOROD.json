  "OVERVIEW": "The Norod Series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils formed in colluvium from basalt and loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface on hill slopes, canyon walls, and ridge tops.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The particle size control section averages 23 to 33 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 65 percent rock fragments by volume.    Depth to secondary carbonates range from 25 to 38 inches.  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 25 to 40 inches.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bt and 2Btk horizons have a value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4, dry or moist.  The upper part is very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam, or very cobbly loam.  The lower part is extremely cobbly loam, very cobbly loam or extremely gravelly clay loam.   The 2Bt horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.  The Btk horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline."
