These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 100 to 120 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 25 inches.  The upper 7 to 10 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent on air dried samples.  The particle size control section averages 23 to 33 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 65 percent rock fragments by volume.    Depth to secondary carbonates range from 25 to 38 inches.  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 25 to 40 inches.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bt and 2Btk horizons have a value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4, dry or moist.  The upper part is very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam, or very cobbly loam.  The lower part is extremely cobbly loam, very cobbly loam or extremely gravelly clay loam.   The 2Bt horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.  The Btk horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Blint soils lack secondary carbonates and are dry 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Bunselmeier soils have sandy clay loam textures, are 40 to 60 inches to unweathered cinders and have mollic epipedons that are 10 to 14 inches thick.  Fleenor soils have hues of 5YR or 7.5YR. are very deep, and are 25 to 40 inches to stones and boulders.  Hehe soils have 10 to 25 percent medium, coarse, and very coarse sand and are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days.  Lainand soils lack secondary carbonates and are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact.  Leidl soils lack secondary carbonates and have mollic epipedons 10 to 18 inches thick and are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  Skooker soils lack secondary carbonates, are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact, and are dry 60 to 90 consecutive days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Norod soils are on hill slopes and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium from basalt and loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface.  Elevations are 1,800 to 2,500 feet.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 12  to 15 inches.  Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 69 degrees F.; and average average annual temperature is 49 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 170 days."
