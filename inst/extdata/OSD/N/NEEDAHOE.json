  "OVERVIEW": "The Needahoe series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rock such as andesite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Needahoe soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rock such as andesite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,400 to 2,600 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 35o to 40o mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
