  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Needahoe soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on summit positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rock such as andesite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,400 to 2,600 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 35o to 40o mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Mopana soils have duripans within 50 cm of the soil surface, have an aridic moisture regime, and have an abrupt increase in clay in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Uawda soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section, do not have duripans, and have paralithic contacts within 100 cm of the soil surface."
