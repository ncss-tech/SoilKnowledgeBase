  "OVERVIEW": "The Nopemountain series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from shale. These soils are on mountain slopes and escarpments. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 800 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees c.",
