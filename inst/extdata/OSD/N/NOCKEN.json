  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sandstone is 20 to 40 inches.  Sandstone pebbles, cobbles, stones, and boulders comprise 35 to 85 percent by volume, with less than 35 percent of the coarse fragments being pebbles. Some pedons contain ironstone fragments.\nThe A1 horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A2 horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. The fine earth fraction is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam. Reaction is neutral to medium acid.  Combined thickness of the A1 and A2 horizons is less than 20 inches. The B21t horizon has a hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.\nThe Bt1 horizon has a hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  The Bt2 horizon has a hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  The fine earth fraction is sandy clay or clay, with a clay content of 40 to about 65 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.  Base saturation ranges from 50 to about 75 percent.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has the same hue, value, and chroma range as the Bt2 horizon.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay with a clay content of the fine earth fraction of 30 to 50 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is reddish, brownish, or yellowish weakly to strongly cemented sandstone containing interbedded ironstone, shale, shaly clay, or loamy earths."

The soil formed in weakly consolidated to cemented sandstone that is frequently interbedded with ironstone, shale, or shaly clay.  Slope gradients are 1 to 25 percent.  The climate is moist and dry subhumid with a mean annual precipitation of 24 to 34 inches, and an annual P-E index of 38 to 52.  At the type location the mean annual temperature is 70 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 70 degrees F."
