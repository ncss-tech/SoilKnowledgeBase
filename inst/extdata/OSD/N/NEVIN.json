  "OVERVIEW": "The Nevin series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium. Nevin soils are on treads and risers on low stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 835 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
