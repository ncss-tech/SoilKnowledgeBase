Depth to bedrock is greater 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Dark colors continue below 20 inches, but organic matter is less than one percent.  The profile has 5 to 18 percent clay and 45 to 75 percent sand throughout.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline throughout.  Depth to secondary carbonate accumulation is 30 to 44 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 20 to 30 percent cobbles, and 10 to 20 percent gravel.  The lower part of the A horizon has textures of sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is sandy loam or loam with 0 to 10 percent stones, 20 to 35 percent cobbles, and 15 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is sandy loam or loam with 30 to 45 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent gravel.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 2 to 5 percent."

Copperton soils have a weakly to moderately cemented horizon at a depth of 12 to 30 inches.  Hupp soils have 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle size control section and depth to secondary carbonates is 10 to 24 inches.  Lakewin soils have secondary carbonates at a depth of 17 to 27 inches and has very gravelly sand at a depth of 20 to 35 inches.  Middle soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Stricker soils have 24 to 30 percent clay in the cambic horizon, more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the calcic horizon, and 18 to 32 inches to secondary carbonates.  Hondee soils have secondary carbonates at 10 to 20 inches.  Tammany soils have carbonates at 15 to 30 inches."

The massive Picture Gorge Basalt exfoliates forming dark colored fine earth material dominantly in the sand fraction.  Slopes are 2 to 90 percent.  Elevation is 2,200 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
