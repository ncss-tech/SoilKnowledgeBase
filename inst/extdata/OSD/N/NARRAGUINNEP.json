  "OVERVIEW": "The Narraguinnep series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from shale. These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, mountain slopes, landslides, drainageways and swales. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
