  "OVERVIEW": "The Nagitsy series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from igneous and quartzitic metamorphic rocks on mountains and foothills.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the average annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",

The Behanin, Blanca, Busterback, Caballo, Compone, Darland, Gateview, Hapgood, Harcany, Hobacker, Lionhead, Lolon, Marcetta, Nazaton, Poleline, Povey, Snag, and Spearhead soils lack bedrock above 40 inches.  Belsac soils have secondary lime and lack cambic horizons.  Croesus, Prong, and Splitbutte soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Dateman soils have clay films in the cambic horizon and in fractures of the bedrock and have continuous \"O\" horizons.  Namela soils have channers and angular cobbles, and are not continually dry for 60 days following the summer solstice.  Nevtah soils lack cambic horizons."
