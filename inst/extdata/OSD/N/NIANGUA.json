  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Niangua series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in cherty sediments and residuum from dolomite. These soils are on upland side slopes and footslopes. Slopes range from about 9 to 50 percent. Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The particle-size control section averages over 60 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam, gravelly silt loam, or very gravelly silt loam. Reaction is neutral to very strongly acid.\nThe E horizon and BE horizons, if present, have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is the gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to vert strongly acid.\nThe upper 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is silty clay or clay or their gravelly analogues. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid. The middle part of the 2Bt horizon has matrix colors in hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is clay or gravelly clay. Reaction is moderately or strongly acid.\nThe lower 2Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is clay or gravelly clay. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline. Chert content in the 2Bt ranges from 0 to about 25 percent. In some pedons this horizon rests on bedded chert 3 to 10 inches thick over dolomite bedrock. In others, it directly overlies the weathered surface of hard dolostone. Some pedons have a sandy clay or sandy clay loam 3Bt horizon with the same colors as the 2Bt."

Endcav soils have cooler temperatures and more rainfall in July and August, lower Thornwaite PE indices and have fewer coarse fragments in the surface layer. Oshkosh soils have thinner sola and do not have bedrock within a depth of 60 inches."

Doniphan, Gepp, and Goss soils are deeper to bedrock and higher in elevation. Doniphan soils are on narrow ridge positions and Gepp and Goss are on side positions. Gasconade soils are shallow and typically on south facing aspects. Union soils have fragipans and are on ridge summit positions."
