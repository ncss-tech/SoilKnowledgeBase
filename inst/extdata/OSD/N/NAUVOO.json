  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches and depth to weathered bedrock is 40 to 80 inches. Coarse fragments of sandstone, shale, or quartz range from 0 to 5 percent in surface layer; 0 to 10 percent in the upper part of the subsoil; and 0 to 15 percent in the lower part. Reaction ranges from moderately to very strongly acid, except for surface layers that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have A horizons less than 6 inches thick with value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. In some pedons, the lower part has lithochromic mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red.\nThe BC horizon is similar in color, except that it may be mottled without dominant value or chroma. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon consists of level bedded, weathered sandstone or interbedded sandstone and shale in shades of red, yellow, or gray. It ranges from very weakly cemented and easily crushed to moderately cemented, massive, and coherent. It is rippable by heavy equipment and can be cut in most places with hand tools.  Some pedons have C horizons, from 2 to 10 inches thick, overlying the paralithic contact."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Apison, Biffle, Cahaba, Durham, Euharlee, Granville, Linker, Murfreesboro (T), Pikecity (T), Pirum, Sipsey, Stringtown, and Suffolk series in the same family and the Hartsells and Spadra soils in closely related families. Apison, Biffle, and Sipsey soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches of the soil surface. Cahaba, Murfreesboro, and Pikecity (T), and Suffolk soils formed in loamy, sandy, or gravelly alluvium on Coastal Plain terraces. Durham soils formed in loamy residuum weathered from acid crystalline rock on broad ridges of the Piedmont region. Euharlee soils formed in upland materials weathered from cherty limestone, and interbedded siltstone, sandstone, and shale of the Southern Appalachian ridge and valley region and they have moderately slow permeability. Granville soils formed in residuum weathered from Triassic aged sandstone and shale of the Piedmont region. Stringtown soils formed in weakly consolidated loamy sediments of the late Tertiary or early Pleistocene age. Pirum soils have an irregular lower boundary over tilted and folded sandstone bedrock at depths between 22 and 55 inches. Hartsells and Linker soils have lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. The Durham, Euharlee, Granville, Pirum and Stringtown soils allow yellowier colors in their subsoil and substratum."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nauvoo soils are on broad plateaus, hilltops, mountainsides, and benches. Slope is dominantly 2 to 10 percent but ranges to 35 percent. The soil formed in loamy residuum weathered from soft sandstone or interbedded sandstone and shale. Near the type location, average temperature is 60 degrees F., and average annual rainfall is about 53 inches."
