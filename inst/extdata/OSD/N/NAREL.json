  "OVERVIEW": "The Narel series consists of deep, well drained permeable soils that formed in material weathered from feldsparic sandstone.  Narel soils are on mountainous areas and have slopes ranging from 8 to 90 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches.",

Lytell soils have firm shotlike concretions in the upper part of the control section, 27 to 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section and have moderate or strong structure in the B2 horizon.  Palix soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Silcox soils are moderately coarse textured.  Swem soils are moderately well drained and have more than 15 percent hard rock fragments in the A and upper B horizons.  Sylvia and Willapa soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less and lack soft sandstone fragments.  Wahkiakkum soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, are neutral to medium acid, have moderate structure in the B2 horizon and have hard basalt gravel in the control section.  Wellman soils have chroma of 2 in the B horizon.  Zenker soils have less than 4 percent organic carbon in the upper part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in material weathered from feldspathic sandstone.  Elevation ranges from near sea level to 1,100 feet.  The soils occur in a coastal marine climate with cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches.  The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 59 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 180 to 220 days."
