The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 20 to 27 percent clay.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  Soil reaction is strongly acid or extremely acid.  Organic carbon ranges from 4 to 7 percent in more than 1/2 of the upper part of the control section.  The umbric epipedon is 11 to 19 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 through 4 dry.  Structure is subangular blocky or granular.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.

Astoria, Boistfort, Lebam, and Vesta soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Bunker, Kinney, and Knappton soils average more than 15 percent hard rock fragments in the control section.  Lytell soils have firm shotlike concretions in the upper part of the control section, 27 to 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section and have moderate or strong structure in the B2 horizon.  Palix soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Silcox soils are moderately coarse textured.  Swem soils are moderately well drained and have more than 15 percent hard rock fragments in the A and upper B horizons.  Sylvia and Willapa soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less and lack soft sandstone fragments.  Wahkiakkum soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, are neutral to medium acid, have moderate structure in the B2 horizon and have hard basalt gravel in the control section.  Wellman soils have chroma of 2 in the B horizon.  Zenker soils have less than 4 percent organic carbon in the upper part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Narel soils are colluvial footslopes and backslopes in mountainous areas deeply incised by many small drainageways.  Slopes are 8 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from feldspathic sandstone.  Elevation ranges from near sea level to 1,100 feet.  The soils occur in a coastal marine climate with cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches.  The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 59 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 180 to 220 days."
