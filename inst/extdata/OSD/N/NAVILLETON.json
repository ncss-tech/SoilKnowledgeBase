Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 102 to 117 cm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free days range from 170 to 200; elevation ranges from 152 to 274 meters (500 to 900 feet)."

    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was included with Crider soils in the 1974 Clark and Floyd Counties, Indiana soil survey, and is identified in the updating of Floyd County. Some data shows the family particle-size class to be contrasting (fine-silty over clayey), but as of 03/2006 this soil is considered dominantly to be in the fine-silty class.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm or 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon)\n2) Argillic horizon: 20 to 183 cm or 8 to 72 inches (Bt and 2Bt horizons)\n3) Lithic contact: 183 to 203 cm or 72 to 80 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for the typical pedon S97IN-043-5 and a similar pedon S97IN-043-2 is available at the NSSL in Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
