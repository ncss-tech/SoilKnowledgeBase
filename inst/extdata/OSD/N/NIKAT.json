  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nikat series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone.  These soils occur on alluvial fans, fan remnants, colluvial aprons, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
