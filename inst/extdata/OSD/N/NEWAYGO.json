  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Newaygo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are moderately deep to stratified sand and gravel. The Newaygo soils formed in loamy materials and are on outwash plains, terraces, and valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).",
