  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Norborne series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy stratified alluvium.  These soils are on slightly elevated positions on flood plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Reaction ranges from neutral to medium acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR; value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3 in the upper part and hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 in the lower part.  Clay content of the Bt horizon ranges between 12 and 18 percent with more than 15 and less than 40 percent sand coarser than very fine.  Textures are very fine sandy loam, loam, and to a lesser extent silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.   Few fine distinct yellowish brown and grayish brown mottles are below 40 inches in many pedons.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand."

Coyne soils are deeper than 40 inches to the upper boundary of the argillic horizon.  Elston and Nottawa soils have sands that are dominantly medium and coarser.  Hesch soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Onarga soils have a mollic epipedon less than 24 inches thick.  Rasset soils are stratified in the B horizon."
