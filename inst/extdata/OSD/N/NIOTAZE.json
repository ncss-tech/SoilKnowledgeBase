Surface creep has distributed fragments of sandstone over the surface of the soil in most locations and the loamier A and E horizons have developed in this material while the clayey B horizons have developed in material from the underlying shale. Discontinuous stone lines are common at top of the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL and Oklahoma State University indicate that the mineralogy is variable across the series and geological range. Both smectitic and mixed pedons have been sampled.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
