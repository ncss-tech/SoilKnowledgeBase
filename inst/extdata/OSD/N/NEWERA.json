  "OVERVIEW": "The Newera series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from rhyolite and altered granite. Newera soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
