  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to dense till (paralithic contact) ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Content of rock fragments is 2 to 15 percent in the upper part and 5 to 20 percent in the lower part of the series control section. The argillic horizon has 8 to 18 percent clay, 45 to 65 percent fine sand and coarser material, and 15 to 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly is loam, but the range includes fine sandy loam and sandy loam.   It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is fine sandy loam, but the range includes sandy loam and loam or thin subhorizons of loamy sand.  It has faint to prominent mottles.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It commonly is sandy loam, but the range includes fine sandy loam and loam.  It has faint to prominent mottles.  There are coatings on peds with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.  Bulk density ranges from 1.45 to 1.75 gm/cc.\nThe BC and Cd horizons have hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5.  Faint to prominent mottles are in the BC horizon and commonly in the upper part of Cd horizon.  These horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  They range from moderately acid to neutral.  Bulk density ranges from 1.95 to 1.90 gm/cc in BC and 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc in Cd horizon.  The BC horizon is restrictive to root penetration due to the platy structure, which is a property of the dense till, but is not as restrictive as the Cd horizon.  The Cd horizon is considered to be a paralithic contact."

Nokay soils formed in noncalcareous dense loamy glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 24 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150 days.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1450 feet."

The well drained Flak and moderately well drained Brainerd soils are on higher lying or more sloping terrain.  The poorly and very poorly drained Parent soils are on flats and have mollic epipedons.  The very poorly drained Prebish soils have mollic epipedons and are in depressions."

Competing series and other updates will be made later.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
