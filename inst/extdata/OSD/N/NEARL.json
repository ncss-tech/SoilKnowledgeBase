The soil formed in a cap of local alluvium derived from mixed sources over residuum from fine textured lacustrine sediments. Elevations range from 5,700 to 8,000 feet. The average annual precipitation is 24 to 35 inches. The average annual air temperature is 33 to 38 degrees F. The frost free season is 15 to 50 days."

Fitzwil soils have argillic horizons that average 18 to 27 percent clay beginning at depths of 24 to 40 inches. Rhylow and Koffgo soils average less than 18 percent clay throughout the profile."
