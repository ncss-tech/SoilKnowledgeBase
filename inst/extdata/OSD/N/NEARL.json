  "OVERVIEW": "The Nearl series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils in mountain basins and on saddles. Slopes are 4 to 20 percent. These soils formed in local alluvium derived from mixed sources over residuum from lacustrine sediments. Nearl soils have slow permeability. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Average annual air temperature is about 33 degrees F.",
