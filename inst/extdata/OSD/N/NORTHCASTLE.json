  "OVERVIEW": "The Northcastle series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from volcaniclastic and tuffaceous material.  Northcastle soils are on fans and stream terraces with slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
