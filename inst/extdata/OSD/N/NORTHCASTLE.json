  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Northcastle soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping fans and stream terraces at elevations of 5,000 to 5,900 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from volcaniclastic and tuffaceous material.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter, and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, and average annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 95 days."

Bluecreek and Yatahoney soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Blackwell soils are on lower alluvial bottomlands.  Bluecreek, Paynecreek, and Yatahoney soils are on similar landscape positions or on higher terraces and fans."
