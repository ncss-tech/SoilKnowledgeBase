The mean annual soil temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F and the temperature remains above 47 degrees F throughout the year.  The soil is dry between 7 and 17 inches in most years for a period of 120 to 150 days from June to October 15, moist in all parts for a period of 135 to 165 days from December 1 to May 1 and moist in some part the rest of the year.  Clay content of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon by weighted average is 27 to 35 percent.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 4/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 3/3; 5YR 3/4.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent.  The horizon is hard and massive in all parts or in at least some part of the upper 10 inches.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 5/6, 5/4, 4/6; 2.5YR 5/6, 4/8, 4/6, or 4/4.

Reaction is medium acid to neutral in the upper part and strongly acid to slightlly acid in the lower part.  Sand grains are on ped faces or in seams throughout the lower part of the Bt horizon in most profiles.

Bruella soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section and 10 to 20 percent coarse plus very coarse sand in the argillic horizon.  Manzanita soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the lower Bt horizon and slow permeability.  Perkins soils have a 20 percent drop in clay content from the maximum and have greater than 75 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon.  Red Bluff soils have a fine textural control section."

Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 17 inches (A1, A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 29 to 78 inches  (Lower part of Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons); plotted.\nClay content of the Bt horizon usually does not drop 20 percent from the maximum within a depth of 60 inches.  Maximum clay content of any subhorizon of the Bt is 35 percent.  Some or all parts of the argillic horizon have a hue of 5YR.\nUltic subgroup feature - base saturation is 64 to 69 percent (HACH Kit) throughout the argillic horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
