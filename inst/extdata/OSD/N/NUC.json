These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone with a component from other sedimentary rocks and some volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,829 to 2,256 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
