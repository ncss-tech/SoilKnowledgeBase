  "OVERVIEW": "The Nawt series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from welded tuff and volcanic ash.  Nawt soils are on breaks.  They have slopes of l5 to 75 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and the average annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",

Gosinta soils occur on terraces, and are fine-loamy.  Rogerson and Schnipper soils occur on terraces and toeslopes.  Rogerson soils are shallow to a hardpan. Schnipper soils are moderately deep to a hardpan.  Stricker soils lack an argillic horizon, and are skeletal."
