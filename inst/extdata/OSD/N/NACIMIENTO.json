  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 60 degrees F. to 64 degrees F. Soil between the depths of about 4 and 12 inches usually is dry all of the time from May until November and usually is moist all the rest of the year. The soil from the surface to or nearly to the paralithic contact is loam, clay or silty clay loam and has 25 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Pieces of shale and other rock fragments range from 1 to 35 percent, but in most pedons are less than 20 percent in most parts of the profile. After plowing the soils are slightly to very strongly calcareous throughout. All of the C horizon and in some pedons the lower part of the A horizon have few to many fine filaments and soft masses of lime. When dry cracks 1/4 to 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of 10 to 20 inches in some pedons but slickensides are absent. Organic matter content ranges from 2 to 5 percent in the upper part and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent within 20 inches of the surface.\nThe A horizon has a dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 4/3, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 2.5Y 3/2. It is soft or slightly hard when dry.\nThe Bk horizon has a dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/4, 8/2, 8/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 6/4, 7/2, 7/4, 8/2, 8/4. Moist values are 4 or more. Some pedons have mixing of the A and C horizons as a result of rodent activity."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Apollo, Domengine, Fontana, Thomhill, Sorrento and Woo series.  Apollo soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Domengine soils have none to slight effervescence in the A horizon and do not have shale fragments or cracks.  Fontana soils lack lime in the upper 10 inches. Sorrento, Thomhill and Woo soils do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nacimiento soils are on mountainous uplands at elevations of 50 to 4,800 feet. Slopes are 9 to 75 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from calcareous shale and sandstone. The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 24 inches. The average January temperature is about 46 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 71 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees to 61 degrees F. The average freeze free season is 150 to 300 days."

Diablo soils are clay soils with slickensides and are more than 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Perkins soils have a hard and massive A horizon and a B2t horizon. San Benito soils are not calcareous in the upper part and have a paralithic contact more than 40 inches below the surface. Santa Lucia soils are medium acid and have more than 35 percent fragments."
