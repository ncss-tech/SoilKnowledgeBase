The horizons are often mixed and churned due to treethrow.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value from 3 through 5 moist, and chroma from 1 through 4 moist.  Texture is silt loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent with 0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobble.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value from 3 through 6 moist, and chroma from 2 through 4 moist.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 70 percent with 15 to 40 percent gravel, 15 to 40 percent cobble.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.  Reaction with HCl is none to slightly effervescent."

Chena soils contain substantial amounts of mica.  Chenega (T) and Mirror Lake soils have pH less than 5.5 in the control section.  Graylock and Ovando (T) soils have cambic horizons.  Nizina (T) soils have less than 15 percent cobbles in the control section.  Obscurity, Polepatch, and Studebaker soils contain volcanic ash in the control section.  Stecum soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface."

The climate is humid maritime with the average annual precipitation ranging from 21 to 65 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 1700 feet.  The frost free season is 90 to 150 days."

Foad and Tolstoi soils occur on adjacent mountain sideslopes and are moderately deep and shallow over bedrock.  Lutak soils occur on alluvial terraces and have spodic horizons.  Kupreanof soils have spodic horizons."
