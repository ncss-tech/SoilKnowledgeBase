  "OVERVIEW": "The Nataga series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in very cobbly alluvium and colluvium on alluvial fans and toeslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

The horizons are often mixed and churned due to treethrow.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value from 3 through 5 moist, and chroma from 1 through 4 moist.  Texture is silt loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent with 0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobble.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value from 3 through 6 moist, and chroma from 2 through 4 moist.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 70 percent with 15 to 40 percent gravel, 15 to 40 percent cobble.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.  Reaction with HCl is none to slightly effervescent."

Chena soils contain substantial amounts of mica.  Chenega (T) and Mirror Lake soils have pH less than 5.5 in the control section.  Graylock and Ovando (T) soils have cambic horizons.  Nizina (T) soils have less than 15 percent cobbles in the control section.  Obscurity, Polepatch, and Studebaker soils contain volcanic ash in the control section.  Stecum soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface."
