  "OVERVIEW": "The Naranjo series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in materials weathered from limestone.  They are sloping to very steep soils on side slopes, foot slopes, and hilltops of the humid uplands.  These soils are very dark grayish brown clay, calcareous in the A horizon, lighter colored, calcareous B and C horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 30 inches.  Depth to the soft limestone is over 60 inches.  Texture is clay in the whole profile.  Consistence is slightly sticky or sticky and plastic.  Gravel fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  These soils are calcareous throughout and effervescence increases with depth.  Pressure faces may or may not be present.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 74 to 76 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR to 2.5Y, and values and chromas of 2 or 3.\nThe B horizons have hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 5 to 7, and chromas of 6 to 8.\nThe C horizons have yellow, brownish yellow, very pale brown, and light gray colors in varying proportions.  Effervescence is violent."

The Aguilita, Coamo, Colinas, Ensenada, Guanabano, Pozo Blanco, Sion, Soller and Yauco series are similar soils in related families.  The Santa Clara soils are shallower with hard rock within 40 inches.  The Aguilita soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in their profiles and lack cambic horizons.  The Coamo, Guanabano and Ensenada, have argillic horizons.  The Colinas have coarser textured profiles.  The Pozo Blanco, Sion and Yauco soils are coarser textured and have ustic moisture regimes.  The Soller soils are shallow to the hard limestone."
