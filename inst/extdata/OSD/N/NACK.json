  "OVERVIEW": "The Nack series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium over flood deposits with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  These soils are on alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section has 25 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments by volume. The depth to a 2Bt ranges from 12 and 20 inches. Thickness of mollic epipedon is more than 60 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 to 4 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is ashy L, cobbly ashy L, or gravelly ashy L.  It has 0.25 to 0.4 percent Alox plus  Feox, 15 to 25 percent volcanic glass, and moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.4 g/cc.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent.\nThe Btk horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline. Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 2 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.
