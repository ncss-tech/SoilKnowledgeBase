    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to the uppermost limit of the irrigation-induced water table is 12 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section has 25 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments by volume. The depth to a 2Bt ranges from 12 and 20 inches. Thickness of mollic epipedon is more than 60 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 to 4 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is ashy L, cobbly ashy L, or gravelly ashy L.  It has 0.25 to 0.4 percent Alox plus  Feox, 15 to 25 percent volcanic glass, and moist bulk density of 1.15 to 1.4 g/cc.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent.\nThe Btk horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline. Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 2 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. Texture is extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, extremely gravelly sandy clay, or extremely cobbly sandy clay loam. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline. Redoximorphic concentrations with chroma of 6 or 8 range from few to many."
