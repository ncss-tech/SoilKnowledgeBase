  "OVERVIEW": "The Nirac series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from calcareous sandstone and limestone with a component of loess.  Nirac soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
