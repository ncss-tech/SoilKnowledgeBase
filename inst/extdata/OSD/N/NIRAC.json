These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from calcareous sandstone or limestone with a component of loess.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,590 to 2,535 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
