  "OVERVIEW": "The Nona series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation of early to mid-Pleistocene age.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in).",

A study of salinity levels was conducted on this and other soils to determine the amount of seasonal variability. During the wetter time of year, ESP levels are typically 1 to 3 points lower than the drier time.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number (S96TX-199-008) from series type location in Hardin County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data available from Texas A&M University (TAMU) Soil Characterization Lab on sample (S96TX-199-008) from the series type location in Hardin County, Texas.
