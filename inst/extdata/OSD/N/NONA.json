A study of salinity levels was conducted on this and other soils to determine the amount of seasonal variability. During the wetter time of year, ESP levels are typically 1 to 3 points lower than the drier time.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number (S96TX-199-008) from series type location in Hardin County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data available from Texas A&M University (TAMU) Soil Characterization Lab on sample (S96TX-199-008) from the series type location in Hardin County, Texas.
