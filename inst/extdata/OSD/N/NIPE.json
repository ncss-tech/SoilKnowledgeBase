  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to serpentinite rock is more than 80 inches.  Fine iron concretions range from none to few throughout the profile.  Base retention is 1 meq. /100 grams of clay in some subhorizon of the oxic.  CEC is less than 16 meq/100 grams of clay in the Bo horizons.  Organic matter content is less than 20 kilograms in a volume of 1 meter square to a depth of 1 meter.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe Oi horizon, where present, consists of decomposed material such as bark, branches, leaves, and twigs.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay.\nThe Bo horizon has hue of 7.5R to 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Cementation is common in areas that are devoid of vegetation and exposed to wetting and drying conditions.  Texture is clay."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nipe soils are on stable ridge tops of hills and mountains in the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent. They formed in iron-rich residuum weathered from serpentinite bedrock.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 73 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 73 to 77 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Delicias and Rosario soils have a cation retention capacity of more than 1 meq. per 100 grams of clay in all parts of the oxic horizon.  In addition, Delicias soils are on lower positions and have less clay in the control section while Rosario soils are moderately deep to serpentinite bedrock.  El Cacique (T) and La Taina (T) soils are on more sloping positions, are shallow to serpentinite bedrock, and are Mollisols.  Maresua and Santa Marta are moderately deep to serpentinite bedrock.  In addition, Maresua and Santa Marta soils are nonacid, lack the red and dusky red colors, and have less weathered profiles.  Maresua soils are Mollisols, Santa Marta soils are Ultisols."
