The particle size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay, and 0 to 5 percent rock fragments.  Mineralogy is mixed. Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent to a depth of 8 inches. Historic over drafting of the groundwater of the Santa Clara valley has drained Newpark soils of water in the lower soil profile, and the soils are considered partially drained today. Historically, Newpark soils were saline in the natural state but decades of irrigation and lowering of water tables has reclaimed these soils, electrical conductivity now ranges from 1 to 3 ms/g.\nThe A horizons dry color is 10YR 5/2, 4/2, 4/1, 3/2 or 3/1. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 2/2 or 2/1. Texture is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. Clay content ranges from 27 to 35 percent. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent gravel.
