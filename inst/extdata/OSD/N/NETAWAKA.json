  "STATES": "KS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Netawaka series consists of very deep well and somewhat excessively drained soils on strongly sloping to steep convex shoulder or side slopes on uplands.   These soils formed in calcareous loess.  Slopes range from 10 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.)  Mean annual precipitation is about 89 centimeters (35 inches).",
