The combined thickness of the A, E, and Bt horizons is 55 to more than 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 57 to 59 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 30 to 45 consecutive days during the late summer. Rock fragments consist of angular pebbles, cobbles, and stones, and range from 20 to 25 percent in the A horizon, 35 to 55 percent in the E horizon, and 50 to 65 percent in the Bt horizon. The control section (10 to 40 inches) ranges from 35 to 55 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It ranges from 15 to 19 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry or moist. It ranges from gravelly or very gravelly clay loam to gravelly loam, and is 19 to 28 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry or moist. It is gravelly or very gravelly clay loam with less than 35 percent clay. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse, subangular blocky. Clay films are thin and range from few to many.
