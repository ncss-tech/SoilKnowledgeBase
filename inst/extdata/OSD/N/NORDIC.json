Depth to the upper boundary of the B2t horizon ranges from 40 to 45 inches. The combined thickness of the Al, A2, and B2t horizons is 55 to more than 60 inches. me mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 45x to 47xF. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 57x to 59xF. The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 30 to 45 consecutive days during the late summer. Rock fragments consist of angular pebbles, cobbles, and stones, and range from 20 to 25 percent in the Al horizon, 35 to 55 percent in the A2 horizon, and 50 to 65 percent in the B2t horizon. me control section (10 to 40 inches) ranges from 35 to 55 percent rock fragments.\nThe Al horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 Or 3 dry and moist. It ranges from 15 to 19 inches thick.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of lOYR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and moist. It ranges from gravelly or very gravelly clay loam to gravelly loam, and is 19 to 28 inches thick.  The B2t horizon has hue of lOYR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry and �oist.  It is gravelly or very gravelly clay loam with less than 35 percent clay. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse, subangular blocky. Clay films are thin and range from few to many. Reaction is medium acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of lOYR or 7.5YR. It is very gravelly or very cobbly heavy loam.\nCompeting Series� These are the Loggert, Lucky Star, Norway Flat and Schuster series. Lvggert soils have very stony A�B or B&A horizons, extremely stony sandy clay l�am argillic horizvns and the combined thickness of the Al and A2 hvrizons is less than 20 inches. Lucky Star soils have A�i3 horizons, and have hue vf SYR or redder in at least part of the argillic horizon. Norway Flat soils have A�B hvrizons below a depth of 40 inches and have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Schuster soils have hue of SYR or 2.5YR in the argillic horizons and the upper boundary of the argillic horizon i5 shallower than 40 inches.\nGeographic Setting: Nordic soils are at elevaLions vf 5,200 to 7,000 feet. They vccur dominantly vn nvrth- and east-facing mountain glopes.  Slvpe gradients are 30 to 60 percent. Parent materials are residuum and colluvium weathered from argillite, phyllite, and schist. The climate is humid, and the average annual precipitation ranges frvm 25 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43x �o 45xF.  The mean summer temperature is 53x to SSxF., and the frost-free period ranges from 70 to 100 days.\nAssociated Soils: These are the Lamondi, Patio, and Yeates Hollow soils.  Lamondi soils have mvllic epipedons more than 20 inches thick, and lack both A2 and argillic horizQns. Patio soils lack argillic hvrizQns and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Yeates Hollow soils have clayey-skeletal argillic horizons, lack A2 horizons, and have mean summer soil temperature vf more than 59xF.\nDrainage and Permeability� Well drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.\nUse and Vegetation� These soils are used for watershed, range and wildlife habitat. The present native vegetation is maple and oak with an understory of fern, Oregon grape, larkspur, and blue wildrye.\nDistribution and Extent� Northern Utah. This series is inextensive.\nSeries Established� !4organ Area, Weber County, Utah, 1974."
