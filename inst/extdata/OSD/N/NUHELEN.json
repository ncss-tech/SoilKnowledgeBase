    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from 3 to 23 cm (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 33 cm (Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 33 cm to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 3 to 33 cm (A, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nClassification was updated to 11th edition on 07/2011 changed Lithic Argixerolls to Aridic Lithic Argixerolls.\nThis series was established under the assumption that it generally has a higher content of volcanic glass than the competing Bellehelen series.  Further study of the differentiating characteristics with the Bellehelen series needs investigation.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data for this pedon is available as S05NV017005 (NSSL Pedon # 05N0666).\nPrevious authors and editors include: JWM/CWL/TM.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
