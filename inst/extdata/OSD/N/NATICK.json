  "OVERVIEW": "The Natick series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvial sands on stream terraces of valleys dissecting the Nebraska Sandhills (MLRA 65). Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 56 centimeters (22 inches) at the type location.",
