Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 20 percent in the surface and spodic horizons and from 5 to 35 percent in the glossic horizons through the substratum. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent and volume of stones ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly  acid to neutral in the substratum. Redox concentrations are below the spodic horizon but within 40 inches. Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.

Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or their gravelly analogs.\nNewood soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E' part has colors and textures like the E' horizon above. The Bt part has colors and textures like the Bt horizon described below.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. The argillic material averages from 6 to 17 percent clay. Bulk density ranges from 1.7 to 1.9 g/cm3.\nThe BCd horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 g/cm3.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.80 to 2.05 g/cm3."

Timber stands are mostly red maple, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, paper birch, and northern red oak with eastern hophornbeam, bigtooth aspen, white ash and yellow birch as associates in most stands. A few areas are cleared and used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grains, and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland."

W. River Falls soils lab with the following results: typical pedon S87WI-069-209: 2.04, 1.99, and 2.04 g/cm3; pedon S87W1-069-196: 1.94, 1.93, and 1.99 g/cm3.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
