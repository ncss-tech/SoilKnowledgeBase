  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Newot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are deep to a densic contact. They formed in loamy till on end moraines, disintegration moraines, ice-walled glacial lake plains, and drumlins. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, slow in the lower part of the solum, and very slow in the substratum. Slope ranges from 10 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
