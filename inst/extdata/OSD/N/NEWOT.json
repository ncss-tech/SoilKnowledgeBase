Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 20 percent in the surface and spodic horizons and from 5 to 35 percent in the glossic horizons through the substratum. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent and volume of stones ranges from 0 to 3 percent throughout. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.
