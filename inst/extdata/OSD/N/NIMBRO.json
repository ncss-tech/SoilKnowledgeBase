  "OVERVIEW": "The Nimbro series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in alluvium.  These flood plain and low terrace soils have slopes of less than 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The control section averages between 25 and 35 percent clay.  Typically the soil is calcareous throughout but has thin layers that are noncalcareous in some pedons.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  Some pedons have buried horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Thin strata of soil materials with higher values are in most pedons, but when mixed have moist values of less than 3.5.  It commonly is silty clay loam or loam but is silt loam or very fine sandy loam in some pedons.  It has thin to thick platy structure in areas of native grass.\nThe AC and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  The C horizon typically is stratified clay loam but is silt loam, or silty clay loam with thin layers of fine sand in some pedons.  Thin layers of fine sand to clay are in most pedons.  Few or common mottles are in some layers in most pedons.  Sand and gravel substrata are between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

Wendte soils are fine textured.  Both Munjor and Wendte soils are in similar positions on the landscape.  Promise and Swanboy soils contain more clay and are on foot slopes and fans above areas of Nimbro soils."
