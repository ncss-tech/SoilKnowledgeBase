  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 40 inches. Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid throughout except where limed. Depth to a horizon that is dense and compact with 5 to 30 percent brittleness ranges from 25 inches or more. Content of ironstone and gravel ranges from 0 to 50 percent in the Bt horizon and from 0 to less than 35 percent in the A, E, BC, BCt, and C horizons. Some pedons have strata or pockets of white or gray kaolin clay in horizons below the Bt horizon. Some pedons have less than 5 percent plinthite in the lower B horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loamy sand or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon is friable and has hue of 5YR to 10YR, but may range to 2.5YR in some pedons, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. None to common, fine or medium mottles in shades of red and brown may occur. Texture is sandy clay or clay. Some pedons have thin transitional horizons with sandy loam texture 8in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon is dense and compact and has hue of 10R through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. It has common to many medium to coarse mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow, or it may be coarsely mottled with these colors. In some pedons the mottles may range to chroma of 1. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy clay or clay in the yellow parts that are firm or friable, and sandy clay loam or sandy clay in the red parts that are dense and compact.\nThe BC or BCt horizon has the same range of colors as the lower part of the Bt horizon. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay and is friable or firm. Some pedons may be partially dense and compact.\nThe BCx or BCtx horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the lower part of the Bt horizon. Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay in the fine-earth fraction. They are dense and compact and have between 5 and 30 percent brittleness.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR 10 10YR, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8, or is variegated in shades of these colors. Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay in the fine-earth fraction. None to common yellowish to brownish heavier-textured mottles may occur."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: (This section not updated this date; 6/16/97) These are Appling, Aragon, Cataula, Cecil, Chestatee, Georgeville, Herndon, Hulett, Kolomoki, Madison, Mayodan, Nankin, Pacolet, Spotsylvania, and Wedowee series in the same family. Appling, Cataula, Cecil, Mayodan, Pacolet, and Wedowee soils have weathered rock (saprolite at depths less than 60 inches. Aragon, Georgeville, Herndon, and Kolomoki soils contain more silt. Chestatee soils are stony. Hulett and Madison soils contain mica. Nankin soils do not have a dense and compact lower subsoil. Spotsylvania soils contain weathered bedrock in the lower part of the solum. Other closely competing soils are the Ailey, Cowarts, Gilead, and Vaucluse series. Ailey soils have a sandy epipedon 20 to 40 inches thick. Cowarts and Vaucluse soils are fine-loamy. Gilead soils have gray mottles in the upper part of the solum."

Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Near the type location, the average annual temperature is 64 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 44 inches."

    "content": "REMARKS: Particle-size data and CEC data are available on several pedons. 05/2008. Minor revisions in support of the Montgomery County, NC correlation were made and reference to slight cementation in the Bt horizon was removed. It is unclear as to the red part of the lower Bt horizon being cemented by the present cementation definition. Additional investigation is needed to determine proper taxonomic placement, presence of relic or contemporary redox features and appropriate diagnostic characteristics.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nSC0114 NEESES      2- 15   60- 66  220-240  44- 48   100- 750\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nSC0114 NONE          6.0-6.0              -     60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nSC0114  0- 8  SL                      0-  0  90-100  5-15  .5-  2\nSC0114  0- 8  LS                      0-  0  90-100  5-12  .5-  1\nSC0114  8-28  SC C                    0-  0  95-100 35-50   3- 10\nSC0114 28-54  SCL SC C                0-  0  92-100 25-50   2- 10\nSC0114 54-85  SL SCL                  0-  0  92-100 15-35   2-  3\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
