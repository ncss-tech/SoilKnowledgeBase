  "OVERVIEW": "The Nara series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils. The soils formed in sandy, eolian deposits of Holocene age. These soils are on very gently to gently sloping interdunes. Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 406mm (16in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Woody shrubs consist of yucca, skunkbush sumac, and sand sage, and the occasional sand plum thickets. This is a fragile site and is subject to severe wind erosion if not protected by cover.
