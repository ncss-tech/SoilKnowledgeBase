Thickness of the solum ranges from 17 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon has moist color of 10YR 2/2 or 3/3.  By volume, it is 20 to 35 percent pebbles and 15 to 25 percent cobbles.  Reaction in 1:1 water is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has moist color of 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, or 4/6 or of 10YR 3/4, 4/4, or 4/6.  It has an apparent field of texture of very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly silty clay loam.  By volume, the B horizon is 15 to 25 percent pebbles and 20 to 25 percent cobbles.  Reaction in 1:1 water is strongly acid or medium acid.  Clay content, as measured by the product of 2.5 times the 15 bar water percentage, is more than 60 percent.\nThe C horizon has lithochromic moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 3/6, or 4/4.  Pebble content ranges from 40 to 85 percent by volume.  Reaction in 1:1 water is strongly acid or medium acid."
