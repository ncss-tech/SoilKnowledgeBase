  "OVERVIEW": "The Nekken series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills and ridgetops.  These soils formed in residuum derived from andesitic and basaltic breccia and tuff.  Slope is 12 to 75 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 145 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 81 degrees F.",

Thickness of the solum ranges from 17 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon has moist color of 10YR 2/2 or 3/3.  By volume, it is 20 to 35 percent pebbles and 15 to 25 percent cobbles.  Reaction in 1:1 water is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has moist color of 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, or 4/6 or of 10YR 3/4, 4/4, or 4/6.  It has an apparent field of texture of very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly silty clay loam.  By volume, the B horizon is 15 to 25 percent pebbles and 20 to 25 percent cobbles.  Reaction in 1:1 water is strongly acid or medium acid.  Clay content, as measured by the product of 2.5 times the 15 bar water percentage, is more than 60 percent.\nThe C horizon has lithochromic moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 3/6, or 4/4.  Pebble content ranges from 40 to 85 percent by volume.  Reaction in 1:1 water is strongly acid or medium acid."
