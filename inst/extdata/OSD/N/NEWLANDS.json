  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Newlands soils are on slightly concave, gently sloping to strongly sloping mountain, or foothill toe slopes, or moderately sloping to steep mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  They formed in residuum and local colluvium derived from basic rocks including andesite, basalt, andesitic tuff, and tuff breccia.  These soils occur at elevations ranging mainly from 1,830 to 2,135 meters, but are as low as 1,427 meters on north exposures.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 400 mm and comes mostly from snow.  The climate is cold, having mean annual temperature of 5 to 7 degrees C."
