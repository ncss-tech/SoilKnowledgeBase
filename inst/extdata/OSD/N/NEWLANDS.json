  "OVERVIEW": "The Newlands series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basic rocks.  Newlands soils are on mountain, plateau or foothill toe and side slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  They formed in residuum and local colluvium derived from basic rocks including andesite, basalt, andesitic tuff, and tuff breccia.  These soils occur at elevations ranging mainly from 1,830 to 2,135 meters, but are as low as 1,427 meters on north exposures.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 400 mm and comes mostly from snow.  The climate is cold, having mean annual temperature of 5 to 7 degrees C."
