Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C., mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 790 mm.  Annual frost free days range from 80 to 140.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 cm (A and E horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 15 to 114 cm (Bw horizons); Oxyaquic subgroup - based on soil saturation above 102 cm; densic contact at 122 cm. The soils do not have an increase in organic carbon materials in the subsoil and are not believed to be Spodosols.\nThe designation of the 2BCd horizon is based on fractures and platy structure in the densic material.  Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record number MN0848 (obsolete).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
