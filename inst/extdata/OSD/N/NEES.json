  "OVERVIEW": "The Nees series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from diorite and similar igneous rocks.  Nees soils are on mountain slopes, and ridges.  Slopes range from 35 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
