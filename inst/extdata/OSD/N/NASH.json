  "OVERVIEW": "The Nash series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable upland soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone of Permian age.  These nearly level to moderately steep soils on convex ridges and side slopes of uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 32 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.",

Minco soils are more than 40 inches thick to bedrock.  Amber and Apalo soils lack a mollic epipedon and have a solum more than 40 inches thick.  Canadian and Crisfield soils have a coarse-loamy control section and are more than 40 inches to bedrock.  Enterprise, Gotebo, and Woodward soils lack a mollic epipedon and have secondary carbonates within 36 inches of the soils surface.  Keokuk and Lugert soils have an irregular distribution of organic matter and are more than 40 inches to bedrock.  Loco and Lucien soils have a solum less than 20 inches thick.  Nashville soils have a fine-silty control section.  Reinach soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and are more than 40 inches thick to bedrock."
