  "OVERVIEW": "The Narbona series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone on ridges of stable landslides and on backslopes of escarpments. Permeability is rapid in the upper part and moderate below. Slopes are 15 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
