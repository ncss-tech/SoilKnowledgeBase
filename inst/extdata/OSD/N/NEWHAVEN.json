  "OVERVIEW": "The Newhaven series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy outwash on low terraces and high flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
