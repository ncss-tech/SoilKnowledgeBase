  "OVERVIEW": "The Nargon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from loess and basalt on lava plains.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
