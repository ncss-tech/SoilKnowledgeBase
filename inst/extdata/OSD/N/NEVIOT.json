  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Neviot soils are on hillslopes and canyon walls and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium from basalt and loess with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Elevations are 1,300 to 2,900 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 170 days."
