  "OVERVIEW": "The Neviot series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from basalt and loess with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Neviot soil are on hillslopes and canyon walls. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F..",
