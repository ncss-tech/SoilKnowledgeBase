  "OVERVIEW": "The Nusmag series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Nusmag soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
