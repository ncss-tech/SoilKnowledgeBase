  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 15 inches.  Depth to unweathered chalky shale and soft limestone ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick. The material in all horizons, including coarse fragments less than 1 inch in diameter, averages more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Coarse fragments in the solum comprise less than 35 percent of the soil mass.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is silt loam and less commonly loam.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  This horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam, and less commonly channery counterparts.  It has moderate or strong, very fine to medium granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, and less commonly channery counterparts.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Nibson series is the only member of the family.  Competing series in other families are the Brownell, Clime, Corinth, Hedville, Heizer, Kipson, Sogn, Talihina, Timken, Vinland, and Wakeen series.  Brownell and Heizer soils are loamy-skeletal.  In addition, Brownell soils have lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Clime, Corinth, and Wakeen soils have paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  In addition, Clime and Corinth soils are fine.  Hedville, Heizer, and Sogn soils have a lithic contact at a depth less than 20 inches.  Kipson soils have mixed mineralogy and are in a wetter climate.  Talihina and Timken soils are clayey.  Vinland soils are in a wetter climate and lack free carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nibson soils are on erosional uplands.  The slope gradient is 3 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in loamy material weathered from interbedded chalky shales and soft limestone (all of cretaceous age in the known area of occurrence).  The mean annual temperature varies from 50 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation varies from 21 to 26 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 35 to 46."
