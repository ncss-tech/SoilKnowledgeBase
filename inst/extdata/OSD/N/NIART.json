  "OVERVIEW": "The Niart series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived mainly from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, mountains, stream terraces, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
