Niart soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived mainly from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 105 to 125 days.  In Colorado elevations are 6,800 to 8,100 feet, the frost-free period is 75 to 95 days, and the mean annual precipitation ranges to 15 inches."
