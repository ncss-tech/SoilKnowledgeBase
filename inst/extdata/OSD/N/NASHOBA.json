  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches and is extremely variable within short distances due to the irregular boundary between the Bw horizon and the underlying tilted bedrock. The soil is moderately acid or strongly acid except where the A horizon has been limed. The fine-earth fraction of the soil is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Stony and gravelly phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 4 or 5, and chromas of 2 or 3. Flat fragments of sandstone less than 3 inches in length make up 10 to 35 percent by volume and more than 3 inches in length make up 10 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 5 or 6, and chromas ranging from 3 to 6. Flat fragments of sandstone less than 3 inches in length make up 20 to 45 percent by volume and more than 3 inches in length make up 15 to 45 percent by volume.\nThe Cr layer is brown, red, or yellow, soft, fine grained sandstone that is fractured and tilted 20 to 90 degrees from horizontal.\nThe R layer is brown, red, or yellowish, hard, fine grained sandstone that is fractured and tilted 20 to 90 degrees from horizontal."

Goldston soils are developed from slaty saprolite and have B2t horizons. Hector soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section and are less than 20 inches thick to bedrock. Manteo, Montevallo and Pickens soils have mixed mineralogy and are less than 20 inches thick to bedrock. Roseland\nsoils have A horizons with moist values of 3 or less. Sulphura soils are less than 20 inches thick and have B2t horizons."

Bismarck soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to soft, shale bedrock, and are on similar and steeper landscapes. Clebit soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to hard, sandstone bedrock, and are on similar and steeeper landscape positions. Honobia soils are on similar areas and have clayey-skeletal control sections. Littlefir soils are in a fine textural class, are moderately well drained, and are on similar landscapes. Mazarn soils formed in loamy sediments adjacent to upland drains and intermittent streams, have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, and are somewhat poorly drained. Mena soils formed in pedisediments and old alluvium, have sola greater than 60 inches, and are in a fine textural class. Sherless soils are on similar landscapes, formed in interbedded shale and sandstone, have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, and have an argillic horizon."
