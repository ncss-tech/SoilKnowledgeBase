  "OVERVIEW": "The Ness series consists of deep poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium and eolian sediments. These nearly level soils are in depressions on uplands or valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 53 centimeters (21 inches), and mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
