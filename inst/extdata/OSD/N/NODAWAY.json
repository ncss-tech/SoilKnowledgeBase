  "OVERVIEW": "The Nodaway series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, upland drainageways, and alluvial fans. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 830 millimeters.",
