  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F.  The subsurface tier is composed dominantly of hemic material but includes thin layers of fibric and sapric material.  Thickness of the organic material ranges from 16 to 51 inches.\nThe Oi horizon is comprised dominantly of sphagnum moss fibers and woody debris that are relatively undecomposed. Thickness of the Oi horizon ranges from 2 to 21 inches.  Thin discontinuous strata of volcanic ash are common.\nThe Oe horizon is comprised dominantly of moss and sedge fibers that are in an intermediate stage of decomposition.  The pH ranges from 4.2 to 5.7.  Thin discontinuous strata of volcanic ash are common.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 45 percent with 25 to 35 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobble."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nuka soils are formed in partially decomposed mosses, sedges, and woody material, that are always saturated, over compact glacial till.  Nuka soils are on slopes affected by seepage and in depressions between glacial moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Elevations are 10 to 1000 feet.\nThe climate is maritime with mild winters and cool summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 65 to 75 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 70 to 120 inches.  Mean January temperature is 25 degrees F., mean July temperature is 54  degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 39 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Kasitsna and Koyuktolik soils.  Kasitsna soils are well drained mineral soils that occur on glacial moraines in complex with Nuka soils.  Koyuktolik soils do not have the mineral layers within the control section and occur in deeper depressions than Nuka soils."
