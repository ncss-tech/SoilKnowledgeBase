    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nire soils are on plateaus and mountains.  These soils formed in eolian material derived from volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,195 to 2,804 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 460 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 99 cm (A1, A2, BAt, and Bt horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade properties - The zone from the soil surface to 76 cm (A1, A2, and BAt horizons and part of the Bt horizon).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 38 to 152 cm (BAt, Bt, and 2Bt/E horizons).\nMajor lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to clayey material at 99 cm (upper boundary of 2Bt/E horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 38 to 100 cm (BAt and Bt horizons and part of 2Bt/E horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: A revision of May 2001 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal over clayey, mixed Argic Pachic Cryoborolls.  The volcanic glass content of the upper horizons is estimated.  Field investigation is needed is confirm that glass contents are not higher than 30 percent.\nPrevious authors include: CMH-EWB-WED.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
