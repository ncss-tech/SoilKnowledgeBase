  "OVERVIEW": "The Nire series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Nire soils are on plateaus and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

These soils formed in eolian material derived from volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,195 to 2,804 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 460 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."

The volcanic glass content of the upper horizons is estimated.  Field investigation is needed is confirm that glass contents are not higher than 30 percent.\nPrevious authors include: CMH-EWB-WED.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
