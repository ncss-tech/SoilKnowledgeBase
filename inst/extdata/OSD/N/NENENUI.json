Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash and cinders over pahoehoe lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 380 to 760 millimeters (15 to 30 inches).  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 1780 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 13 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees F).  The mean summer and winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
