  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nofet soils are on low terraces of the Carson River at elevations of 1,375 to 1,405 meters. Slopes are less than 2 percent but the terraces are cut by many deep broad drainage channels and sloughs. The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from granite, basalt, rhyolite, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks. The climate is cool, semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of about 200 to 250 mm that comes mostly in the winter and spring months, mean annual temperature is about 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 90 to 110 days."
