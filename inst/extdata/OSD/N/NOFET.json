  "OVERVIEW": "The Nofet series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. The Nofet soils are on low river terraces and have slopes of less than 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
