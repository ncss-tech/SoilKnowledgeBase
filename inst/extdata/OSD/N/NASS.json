  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  The soil moisture is seldom at the wilting point.  A permanent water table ranges from 6 inches below to 24 inches above the soil surface.  It has a peraquic moisture regime.  The electrical conductivity varies seasonally and with rainfall but is usually between 2 and 16 dS/m in the upper 20 inches and between 4 and 25 dS/m below 20 inches.  The SAR is less than 15.  The texture ranges from fine or very fine sand to very fine sandy loam.  The control section contains at least one horizon that is loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, or finer.  Few to many gray, brown, and yellow redox features are present in most pedons.  Most pedons contain sand sized shell fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or N, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less. Where the value is 3, the thickness is less than 7 inches.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or N, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Colors in matrix are due to uncoated sand grain.  Some pedons have loamy strata below 40 inches.  Some pedons have thin strata that contain up to 30 percent marine shells."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.  Similar soils are the Dianola, Karankawa, Mustang, and Tatton series.  Karankawa soils are more saline, have SAR of more than 15, and are subject to tidal flooding.  Dianola and Mustang series are poorly drained, are deeper to a permanent water table, and have textures of loamy fine sand or coarser throughout the control section.  Tatton soils have texture of loamy fine sand or coarser, have higher electrical conductivity, and are barren of vegetation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches and is distributed throughout the year.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 72 degrees to 74 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 50 to 75."

Galveston, Mustang and Sabine soils are in higher positions, have a deeper water table, and have textures of loamy fine sand and coarser throughout."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

A permanent water table is at of near the surface for nine months of the year.  In addition, the soil is seasonally ponded and fluctuates from 0 to 24 inches above the soil surface.  Most areas are flooded by sea water during severe storms."

Field observations indicate that the darker subhorizons are not buried A horizons but are caused by enrichment of dark material.\nClassification changed from Typic Haplaquents to Typic Endoaquents 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  Further study of the series is needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nPeraquic moisture regime\nOchric epipedon-0 to 27 inches (A horizon).\nLow chroma colors due to wetness\nADDITIONAL DATA: Texas A&M data from type location (S79TX-167-39).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
