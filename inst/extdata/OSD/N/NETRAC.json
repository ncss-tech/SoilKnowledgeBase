Netrac soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days between depths of 8 to 24 inches following summer solstice.  They are slightly acid or neutral throughout.   The particle- size control section averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.\nThe Al horizon have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of l or 2 moist and dry.\nThe 2Alb and the 2B2b horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are sand, loamy fine sand or gravelly fine sand.\nThe 2C horizon is extremely gravelly sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly fine sand. It has 60 to 90 percent coarse fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Netrac soils are on glacial outwash terraces and have slopes of 0 to l5 percent. They formed in glacial outwash with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations are 800 to l,500 feet.  The soils are in a marine type climate with average annual precipitation of 50 to 70 inches occurring mostly as rain during the winter; mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is l25 to l75 days."

Nevat soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Ledow soils lack the surface layer of ash and have less than 35 percent  rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Schooley soils are coarse-loamy and have an aquic moisture regime."
