  "OVERVIEW": "The Nomisurvay consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Nomisurvay soils are on hills. Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
