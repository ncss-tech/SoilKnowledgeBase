In addition Crawley and Siscab soils have rock fragments dominated by 2 to 5 mm diameter gravel. Luppino soils are 30 to 50 cm to paralithic materials and have rock fragments dominated by 2 to 5 mm diameter gravel. Wedekind soils are 25 to 50 cm to paralithic materials and lack a lithic contact within 50 to 75 cm."

Slopes are 4 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,525to 1,800 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 cm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 80 days."
