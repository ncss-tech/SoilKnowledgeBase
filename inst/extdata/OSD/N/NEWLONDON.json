  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 0 to 25 cm (0 and 10 inches). The 25 to 102 cm (10 to 40 inch) particle-size control section averages between 28 and 35 clay, although some thin horizons have up to 42 percent clay. Content of fine sand and coarser ranges from 15 to 30 percent. Bulk density in the lower part of the series control section ranges from 1.6 to 1.8 gm/cc. Rock fragments of mixed lithology comprise 1 to 5 percent of all horizons. Shale is a common component of the coarse sand fraction.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is typically clay loam but where a thin lacustrine mantle exists it is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less are above a depth of 24 inches.  It is typically clay loam but where a thin lacustrine mantle exists it is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe BC or C horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam. It is slighlty alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Newlondon soils are on convex slopes on moraines. Slope ranges from 6 to 18 percent. They formed in a thin discontinuous fine textured mantle overlying firm till thought to be of Pre-Wisconsin age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 9 degrees C (45 to 48 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is 660 to 711 m (24 to 30 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 155 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 320 to 381 m (1050 to 1250 feet) above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Parkton, Corves , Cosmos, Danielson, Kandiyohi , Lora and Stout soils. The moderately well drained Parkton and Stout soils are on less sloping areas and have a mollic epipedon. Somewhat poorly drained Kandiyohi soils are on nearly level summits. The poorly drained Cosmos soils are on nearly level lower lying positions on the landscape. Poorly drained Corves soils are on rims bordering depressions. Poorly drained Danielson soils are on foot slopes. Very poorly drained Lura soils are in depressions."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is .42 to 4.23 micrometers per second (.06 to .6 inches inches per hour). Perched seasonal high saturation is as high as 30 cm (12 inches) at some time during March to July and October to November in normal years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic features recognized in this pedon include: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (7 inches); (Ap horizon); other features: aquic subgroup - low chroma matrix (redoximorphic depletions) within 61 cm (24 inches) of the surface; udic moisture regime. The normal slope-water table relationship is not valid in this soil due to the bulk density and restricted permeability causing perched conditions.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station Central File Code numbers 4521 and 4522 for results of laboratory analyses of some pedons of this series.\nRefer to the PhD thesis, 1984, by James Crum, University of Minnesota on the nature Kandiyohi till entitled \"Soils and Till Stratigraphy of West-Central Minnesota.\"\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
