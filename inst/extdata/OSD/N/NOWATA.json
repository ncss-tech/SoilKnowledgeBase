  "OVERVIEW": "The Nowata series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy material weathered from cherty limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  These very gently sloping to sloping soils are on slightly convex side slopes of uplands in the Cherokee Prairies.  Slope ranges from 2 to 7 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 15.5 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
