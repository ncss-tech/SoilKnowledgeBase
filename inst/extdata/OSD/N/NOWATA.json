Soils in similar families are the Caspiana, Catoosa, Claremore, Clareson, Eldorado, Fitzhugh, Lula, Mason, Mer Rouge, Newtonia, Scullin and Tiptonville series.  Caspiana, Eldorado, Fitzhugh, Lula, Mason, Mer Rouge, Newtonia, and Tiptonville soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches).  Claremore soils are shallower than 51 cm (20 inches).  Catoosa soils have a fine-silty control section, and Scullin soils have a fine control section.  Clareson soils have a clayey-skeletal control section."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1143 mm (38 to 45 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13.8 to 18 degrees C (57 degrees to 64 degrees F).
