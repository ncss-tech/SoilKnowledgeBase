    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ninepoint soils are on broad, nearly level alluvial flats in a semi-bolson landscape.  They formed in fine-silty alluvium of Holocene age, derived mainly from Cretaceous limestone and mudstone.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent, mostly less than 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches, and occurs as high intensity rainfall during convectional afternoon thunderstorms from June through September. Frost-free period is 240 to 280 days.  Elevation is 1,800 to 3,500 feet."
