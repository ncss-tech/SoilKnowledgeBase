Bushpart soils have a udic moisture regime.  Copenhaver and Nieman soils are defined as having an ustic moisture regime. Donkehill soils have a mean summer soil temperature of 46 to 50 degrees F. and has secondary carbonates below the mollic epipedon.  Hogmalat soils are strongly or moderately acid.  Layview soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 43 to 47 degrees F.  Maygal soils have rock fragments consisting of angular rhyolite and andesite.  Mosroc soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granite with rock fragments consisting of angular granite.  Mountpatterson soils have 15 to 30 percent glass and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.2 to 0.4 percent (Vitrandic).  Notstew soils have rock fragments dominated by andesite and the surface horizons (a) contain 25 to 50 percent glass and have an abrupt boundary with a 15 percent clay increase between the A and Bt horizons.  Thiefridge soils have a mollic epipedon 14 to 20 inches thick and have a mean summer soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F."
