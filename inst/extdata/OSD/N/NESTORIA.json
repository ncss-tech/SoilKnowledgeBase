  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Nestoria Series are shallow and well drained.  They formed in materials that weathered from Triassic and Jurassic red beds of siltstone, and fine grained sandstone.  They are on side slopes in dissected landscapes in the Culpeper Basin of the Northern part of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees  F., and annual precipitation is about 41 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to Cr horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches, and depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of siltstones and sandstones range from 15 to 50 percent in the A horizon, and from 35 to 75 percent in the B and C horizon.  The fine earth fraction of the textural control has more than 50 percent silt plus very fine sand. The mineralogy of the sand and silt fractions are dominated by iron oxides, quartz and muscovite mica.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly through medium acid unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of lOR through 5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Then A horizons include chroma of 2.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of lOR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, or loam, in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of lOR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of lOR through 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is dense in place but well weathered red beds that can be dug with hand tools.  Bedrock is not removable with hand equipment."

Catlett soils are developed from hornfil and granulite parent materials and do not have red hue in the solum.  Oteen and Klinesville soils are in closely related families.  The Oteen soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  The Klinesville soils do not have an Argillic horizon."
