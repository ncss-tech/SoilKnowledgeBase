  "OVERVIEW": "The Newpass series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic and metavolcanic rocks with additions of loess.  The Newpass soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
