    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 46 centimeters (0 to 18 inches) (Ap, A, BA)\nArgillic horizon: 46 to 86 centimeters (18 to 34 inches) (Bt, Btk)\nWater table: 0.6 to 1.2 meters (2 to 4 feet) during the months of Dec. - Apr.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy: Eighth edition, 1998\nADDITIONAL DATA: These soils were formerly mapped as Dale or Farnum soils in Reno County and as Kaski soils in Rice County. They differ from Dale and Kaski soils in that they have an argillic horizon and a seasonal water table within a depth of 1.5 meters (5 feet). They differ from Farnum soils in that they are less than 91 centimeters (36 inches) deep to free carbonates and have a seasonal water table within a depth of 1.5 meters (5 feet). Clay values were determined by laboratory methods.\nAdditional Laboratory Analysis: S90KS155010\nModified format by LRM in 2/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
