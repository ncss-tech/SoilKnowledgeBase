  "OVERVIEW": "The Nickerson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in old alluvium. These soils are on wind modified terraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 74 centimeters (29 inches), and the mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C. (57 degrees F.)",

They differ from Dale and Kaski soils in that they have an argillic horizon and a seasonal water table within a depth of 1.5 meters (5 feet). They differ from Farnum soils in that they are less than 91 centimeters (36 inches) deep to free carbonates and have a seasonal water table within a depth of 1.5 meters (5 feet). Clay values were determined by laboratory methods.\nAdditional Laboratory Analysis: S90KS155010\nModified format by LRM in 2/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.
