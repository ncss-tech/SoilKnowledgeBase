  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 or more inches.  Depth to bedrock is 3 1/2 to 10 feet.  Coarse fragments are dominantly pebbles or cobblestones of quartz or gneiss.  Most pedons contain a few fragments of shale in the solum but the amount increases sharply in the C horizon.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and B horizons and 2 to 90 percent in the C horizon.  The soil ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid where unlimed.  The Ap horizon ranges from dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) through dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2).  The A1 horizon is black (5YR 2/1) or nearly black; and the A2 horizon reddish brown (5YR 4/4) to dark reddish brown (5YR 3/3).  The A horizons are loam or silt loam.  The Bt horizon has hues of 10R and 2.5YR, values of 3 or 4 and chromas of 3 through 6.  It is mainly heavy silty clay loam but the range includes heavy clay loam and clay.  Subhorizons of the argillic horizon range from 30 to 50 percent clay and the upper 20 inches averages more than 35 percent.  The upper part of the B horizon commonly has moderate medium prismatic structure parting to moderate medium platy and strong to moderate medium subangular and angular blocky structure; the lower part is generally massive, and some pedons have thin vertical cracks.  The soil is very firm and few roots reach beyond a depth of 24 inches except those that are in cracks.  The C horizon dominantly has hues of 2.5YR, values of 3 and chroma of 4.  It ranges from shaly or very shaly loam to sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fauquier, Fredonia, Montalto, Needmore and Pisgah series.  The Fauquier and Needmore soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Fredonia soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent.  The Montalto soils have coarse fragments of diabase or basalt throughout the sola.  Pisgah soils have Bt horizons of 7.5YR or yellower hue and have angular chert fragments throughout the solum.  GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Norton soils are on broad, gently sloping uplands.  They formed in materials derived largely from acid red shale of Triassic age and are underlain by such rocks.  The materials are presumed to be mostly glacial till of pre-Wisconsin age or periglacial deposits of similar age.  Locally the materials are colluvium underlain by red shale.  The climate is humid temperate.  Average annual temperatures range from 50 to 55 degrees F., average annual precipitation from 40 to 48 inches and frost free days from 160 to 190."

Bucks and Penn soils contain less clay in the Bt horizon and Penn soils are also shallower to bedrock.  The Doylestown, Lansdowne and Reaville soils have mottles of low chroma in the upper part of the Bt horizons."
