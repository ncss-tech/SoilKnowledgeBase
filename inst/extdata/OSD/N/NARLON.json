  "OVERVIEW": "The Narlon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in old eolian deposits over clayey marine deposits. Narlon soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 415 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
