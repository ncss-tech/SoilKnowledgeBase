  "OVERVIEW": "The Narlon series is a member of the clayey, mixed, thermic family of Typic Albaquults.  Typically, Narlon soils have light brownish gray and pale brown, medium and strongly acid, loamy sand A1 horizons, light gray, strongly acid, loamy sand A2 horizons, gray, mottled, very strongly acid, clay B2t horizons.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the top of the B2t horizon is about 12 to 45 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 degrees to 60 degrees F.  In most years the A1 and A2 horizons are saturated to within 3 to 10 inches of the surface from about January through March. These horizons become dry sometime in May, June or July and remain dry until November or early December.\nThe A1 horizon is gray, light brownish gray, grayish brown or pale brown.  Dry values of 5 or less and moist values of 3 or less extend to depths of less than 10 inches.  This horizon is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, and in a few pedons, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is moderately to strongly acid.\nThe A2 horizon is light gray or white.  It has few to common faint to distinct brownish or reddish mottles and 1 to 15 percent brown and reddish brown concretions 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter.  In some pedons there are small reddish lumps not fully cemented.  This horizon is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe lower boundary is abrupt or there are relic parts of the B2t horizon within the lowest part of the A2 horizon.  Matrix colors in the B2t horizon are in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y with chroma of 1 or 2.  There are many coarse mottles and blotches or brighter color.  Hue of the mottles is 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, 2.5YR or 10R and the chroma is 4 to 6.\nThe B2t horizon is clay or sandy clay.  It usually has moderate or strong prismatic or columnar structure but in some pedons the lower part is angular blocky.  This horizon is strongly or very strongly acid and has 20 to 35 percent base saturation.  Some pedons have a few non-intersecting slickensides and some pockets and veins of bleached sand.\nLower horizons consist of B3 or C horizons.  Unrelated rock formations or other slowly or very slowly permeable material underlie the profile at a depth of about 5 to 10 feet."

Bladen and Leaf soils are not dry for 60 consecutive days in the summer and fall.  Chesterton and Huichica soils have a duripan and lack mottles in the argillic horizon.  Cotati, Haire, and Kilarc soils lack mottles in the argillic horizons.  Las Flores and San Ysidro soils lack mottles and have a base saturation of more than 75 percent in the argillic horizon.  Noyo soils have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Tangair soils are sandy and lack an argillic horizon.  Wright soils have a base saturation of more than 35 percent and the soil temperature is less than 59 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Narlon soils are on partially dissected terraces of nearly level to moderate slopes at elevations of 20 to 800 feet.  Typical profile expressions are on nearly level areas.  Level phases and more loamy types have low distinct \"hog wallow\" micro relief.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with cool rainless but foggy summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. Average January temperature is about 53 degrees F., average July temperature is about 59 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The average freeze-free season is about 300 days."
