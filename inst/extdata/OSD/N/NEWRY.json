  "OVERVIEW": "The Newry series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in 35 to 60 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying calcareous, loamy glacial till. These soils are on linear and slightly convex slopes on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 4 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.",
