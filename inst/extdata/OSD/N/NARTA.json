Native grasses are salt tolerant species such as gulf cordgrass, hartweg paspalum, seashore saltgrass, switchgrass, shoregrass, and buffalograss.  Woody invaders are mostly stunted mesquite, bushy sea-oxeye, and cactus.  A few local areas are used as pasture and planted to improved and introduced grasses.

Texas Highway Department test reports indicate that plasticity index values are about 25 percent higher than normally expected in a smectitic mineralogy class.
