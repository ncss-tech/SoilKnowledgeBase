  "OVERVIEW": "The Nageezi series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian material derived dominantly from sandstone.  Nageezi soils are on treads of high stream terraces and fan terraces and have moderately rapid permeability. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

Kimbeto soils are fine-loamy with natric, calcic, and gypsic horizons; under plant communities reflecting moderately saline-sodic conditions. Razito soils are sandy and lack diagnostic horizons; on stable dunes and low fan terraces. Shiprock soils have argillic horizons and occur on adjacent surfaces."
