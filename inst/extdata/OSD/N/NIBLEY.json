    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 19 inches thick. The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons range from 16 to 21 inches over the horizon of carbonate accumulation. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 50 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F. The soils are usually saturated within a depth of 30 inches when not drained and are not dry in all parts of the 4 to 12 inch section for 60 consecutive days in 7 out of 10 years. The watertable is mainly 30 to 50 inches below the soil surface in the undrained areas and 50 to 60 inches in the drained areas.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and contains 2 to 3 percent organic matter. It has weak to moderate and fine to coarse granular or subangular blocky structure. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline. It is 10 to 15 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silty clay loam with more than 35 percent clay or is silty clay. This horizon has weak to moderate, medium prismatic structure. It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. They are silty clay or silty clay loam. These horizons have weak, medium prismatic to moderate fine to medium subangular blocky structure. They are moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It ranges from silt loam to silty clay and is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The mean annual summer temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 150 days."
