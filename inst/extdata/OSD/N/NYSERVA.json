Beowawe soils do not receive the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation. Genegraf soils do not have a Bqk horizon with durinodes in a friable matrix. Jerval soils have A and Bt horizons that are greater than 38 cm thick.  Honlak soils are moderately well drained and are not stratified below 48 cm.  Ricert soils have a continuous weak silica cementation at 36 to 64 cm."
