  "OVERVIEW": "The Nyserva series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Nyserva soils are on lake terraces, alluvial flats and lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annul temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
