  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 10 to 40 inches. Reaction of the solum ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline. Volume of gravel range from 0 to 35 percent in the A and Bt1 horizons and from 35 to 60 percent in the 2Bt, 2BC, and 2C horizons.  Volume of coarse fragments over 3 inches range from 0 to 10 percent in the A and E horizons and from 5 to 30 percent in the 2Bt, 2BC, and 2C horizons. The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3, or it is N 2/0, N 3/0, or N 4/0.  Where present, the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nSome pedons have E horizons.  Where present, it has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A, Ap, and E horizons are sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or gravelly analogues of these textures.\nSome pedons have Bw horizons up to 12 inches thick with colors similar to he Bt1 horizon and textures similar to the A and E horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is very gravelly fine sandy loam, very gravelly loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is very gravelly sand, very gravelly coarse sand, or very gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly sand.  Some pedons have sand layers present. Stratification is common."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Balmlake, Cunard, Emmet, Flak, Heyder, Milaca, Oconto, and Omena series in the same family and the Kiva series.  Balmlake, Emmet, Flak, Heyder, Oconto, and Omena soils have fewer coarse fragments in the lower part of the profile.  In addition, Emmet, Heyder, and Omena soils developed in sandy loam or loamy sand glacial till.  Cunard soils have limestone bedrock above depths of 40 inches.  Kiva soils have spodic horizons and have fewer coarse fragments in the control section.  Milaca soils have very firm till within depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on stream terraces, glacial outwash plains, eskers, and kames.  Slope gradients are typically 0 to 12 percent but range from 0 to 45 percent.  Nadeau soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits consisting of 10 to 20 inches of loamy deposits overlying stratified sand and gravel.  Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 41 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches."
