  "OVERVIEW": "The Nisula series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvial material from basaltic and granitic sources. Nisula soils are on alluvial fans and colluvial footslopes and have slopes of 2 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
