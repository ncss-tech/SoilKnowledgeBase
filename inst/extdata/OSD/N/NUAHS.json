  "OVERVIEW": "The Nuahs series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from dominantly granitic and rhyolitic rocks.  Nuahs soils are on fan skirts and lake plain terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 100 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
