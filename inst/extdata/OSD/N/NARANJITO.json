    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to semi-consolidated rock ranges from 25 to 40 inches. Angular gravel fragments, 1/8 to 2 inches in size, range from 5 to 15 percent by volume throughout the soil.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid throughout.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 76 to 80 degrees F.\nThe A horizons have hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  They are silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hues or 5YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  They are clay and have weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure.  They have few faint or common distinct clay films.\nThe C horizon has variegated colors.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam and has slightly plastic or plastic consistence."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Daguao series is in the same family.  Daguao soils have hue of 10YR in the B horizon and crystals of hornblende.\nThe Alonso, Aibonito, Ciales, Cidral, Daguey, Humatas, Lares, Limones, Lirios, Los Guineos, Picacho, Rio Piedras, and Voladora series are similar soils in related families.  Alonso, Aibonito, Daguey and Limones soils have CEC values between 16 and 24 meg/100 grams of clay. The Ciales, Lares and Picacho soils have low chroma mottles in the B horizon.  Cidral soils have sola thicker than 60 inches.  Humatas and Rio Piedras soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Lirios soils have clayey over loamy particle-size control sections.  Los Guineos soils have hues of 10YR in the upper part of the B horizon.  Voladora soils are Rhodudults."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Naranjito soils are moderately steep to very steep on sideslopes and ridgetops of strongly dissected volcanic uplands.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in moderately fine to fine textured residuum weathered from volcanic rocks.   The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 75 to 100 inches, and the average annual temperature is from 74 to 78 degrees F."
