  "OVERVIEW": "The Northville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in clayey alluvium.  These soils are on flats, stream terraces and floodplains. Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 46 degree F.",
