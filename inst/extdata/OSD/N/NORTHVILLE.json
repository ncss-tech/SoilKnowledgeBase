Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silt loam, but it is silty clay loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Gray or light gray silt coatings are on the faces of peds.
