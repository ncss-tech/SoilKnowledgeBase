  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to soft weathered bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. Depth to hard limestone bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Chert content ranges from 10 to 15 percent in the surface layer and from 15 to 35 percent in the subsoil. Chert content ranges up to 60 percent in the substratum. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe A horizon has hue 10YR, value 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Where the value and chroma are less than 4, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick. Texture is cherty silt loam.\nThe BA horizon and BE, where present, has hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value 5 or 6 and chroma 4 or 6. Texture is cherty silt loam or cherty silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is cherty silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue 5YR or 2.5YR, value 4 or 5 and chroma 6 or 8; rarely hue of 7.5YR, value 5, chroma of 6 or 8 in the upper part of the horizon. Most pedons have mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and red.  Texture is cherty silt\nloam or cherty silty clay with clay content increasing with depth. In some pedons, the lower part of the Bt horizon is cherty silty clay or cherty clay.\nThe BC horizon or C horizon, where present, has the same colors and textures as the Bt horizon. It has few to many mottles in shades of red, yellow, and brown. Boundary with the underlying CR horizon is commonly abrupt.\nThe CR horizon is a mixture of highly weathered bedrock interlayered with seams of chert and silty clay loam to clay soil material. A few roots are in cracks and seams."

The Cahaba, Cowarts, Durham, Emporia, Euharlee, Granville, Kempsville, Marvyn, Nectar, Spadra, Suffolk and Valcluse series do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches. The Apison series has a solum thickness of less than 40 inches. Pirum soils have a lithic contact with sandstone within 50 inches. Soil series in similar families include Cheaha, Fruithurst, Rion, Sherless, Sherwood and Tidings soils.  All of these have mixed mineralogy. In addition, Cheaha soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches. Fruithurst soils have a paralithic contact with slate. Rion soils have solum thickness less than 40 inches over acid crystalline rocks.  Rome soils have\nsolum thickness greater than 60 inches.  Sherless soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone within 40 inches.  Sherwood soils have a lithic contact with sandstone within 60 inches and Tidings soils have s solum thickness less than 40 inches and a lithic contact within 60 inches.  Also in a similar family are the Mountview and Lonewood series.   Both are mesic.  In addition, Mountview is fine-silty and Lonewood contains less than 15 percent coarse fragments."
