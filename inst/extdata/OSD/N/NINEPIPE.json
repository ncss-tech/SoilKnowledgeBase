  "OVERVIEW": "The Ninepipe series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on low stream terraces, dissected alluvial fans, and in drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
