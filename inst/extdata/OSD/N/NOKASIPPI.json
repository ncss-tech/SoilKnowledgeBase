  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a dense till paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  Typically the sandy sediments contain 0 to 2 percent rock fragments by volume, but ranges to 15 percent.  The 2B and 2C horizons contain 1 to 15 percent rock fragments.  A stone line ranging to 8 inches in thickness and containing as much as 40 percent rock fragments commonly is at the contact between the two materials in many pedons.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 16 inches in thickness.  The size of the sand in the A horizon and B horizon typically is fine and medium.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, and fine sandy loam or their mucky analogues.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon and upper part of the 2Bg horizon have 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1, or 2.5Y hue and chroma of 2.  They have distinct or prominent redox features.  The Bg horizon is loamy fine sand, fine sand, sand or loamy sand.  The 2Bg horizon is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The Bg and 2Bg horizons range from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  It is friable to firm.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  It is very firm.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.80 to 2.00 g/cc."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or slightly concave slopes on drumlins or moraines.  Slope gradients are 0 to 1 percent.  The Nokasippi soils have formed in a sandy mantle of aeolian or lacustrine material and firm dense till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1450 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are Bushville and Watab soils which form a drainage sequence with the Nokasippi soils.  The moderately well drained Bushville soils are at the upland positions. The somewhat poorly drained Watab soils are typically more sloping and on higher lying positions than the Nokasippi soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Surface runoff is low to ponded.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and very slow in the dense till.  Saturation occurs at the surface during the months of April to June in normal years.  Ponding is frequent for long duration in spring and fall."
