Depth to a paralithic contact with sandstone and thickness of volcanic ash influence is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10.  By weighted average, the control section has 5 to 20 percent hard rounded pebbles, 20 to 40 percent weathered pebbles, and 0 to 15 percent weathered cobbles.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist, 4 through 6 dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent hard rounded pebbles, 10 to 25 percent weathered pebbles, and 0 to 15 percent weathered cobbles.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent hard rounded pebbles, 15 to 30 percent weathered pebbles, and 0 to 15 percent weathered cobbles.  It is loam or sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry.  It has 5 to 25 percent hard rounded pebbles, 15 to 45 percent weathered pebbles, and 0 to 20 percent weathered cobbles and stones.  It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or gravelly loam.  Some pedons have a C horizon and lack a BC horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nati soils are on colluvial mountain backslopes and plateaus at elevations of 100 to 1,600 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from sandstone and siltstone with an admixture of volcanic ash and glacial till.  Nati soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 140 to 170 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This draft reflects a change in classification from medial, mesic Andic Xerochrepts to coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Haplorthods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 8 inches, a spodic horizon from 8 to 16 inches, and a paralithic contact at 31 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet spodic chemical criteria, but does meet micro morphological criteria, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
