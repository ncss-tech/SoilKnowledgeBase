  "OVERVIEW": "The Nati series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from sandstone and siltstone with an admixture of volcanic ash and glacial till.  Nati soils are on foothill backslopes and toeslopes and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees to 51 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact with sandstone and thickness of volcanic ash influence is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice in 6 or more years out of 10.  By weighted average, the control section has 5 to 20 percent hard rounded pebbles, 20 to 40 percent weathered pebbles, and 0 to 15 percent weathered cobbles.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist, 4 through 6 dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent hard rounded pebbles, 10 to 25 percent weathered pebbles, and 0 to 15 percent weathered cobbles.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent hard rounded pebbles, 15 to 30 percent weathered pebbles, and 0 to 15 percent weathered cobbles.  It is loam or sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry.  It has 5 to 25 percent hard rounded pebbles, 15 to 45 percent weathered pebbles, and 0 to 20 percent weathered cobbles and stones.  It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or gravelly loam.  Some pedons have a C horizon and lack a BC horizon."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 8 inches, a spodic horizon from 8 to 16 inches, and a paralithic contact at 31 inches.  The spodic horizon does not meet spodic chemical criteria, but does meet micro morphological criteria, i.e. cracked coatings and silt-sized and larger pellets.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
