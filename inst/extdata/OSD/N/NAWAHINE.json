Slope gradients range from 20 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash and cinders.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 centimeters (20 to 50 inches).  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 1780 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
