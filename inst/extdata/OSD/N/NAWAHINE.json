  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nawahine soils are associated with cinder cones on the upper slopes of Hualalai Volcano at elevations from 1164 to 2521 meters (3820 to 8271 feet).  These soils are on hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of steep to very steep cinder cones and lava flows 1,500 to 3,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 20 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash and cinders.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 centimeters (20 to 50 inches).  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 1780 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
