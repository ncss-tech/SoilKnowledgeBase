Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is arid with cool winters and  dry summers.  Distribution of precipitation is relatively even with slight peaks in January and August.  The mean annual precipitation is between 3 and 5 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 210 to 240 days."
