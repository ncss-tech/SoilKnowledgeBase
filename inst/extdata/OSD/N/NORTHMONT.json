(2Btb2, 2BCb, and 2C horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity-- change of parent material from human-transported materials to fluviomarine deposits at a depth of 56 centimeters\nHuman-transported materials--the zone from a depth of 0 to 56 centimeters. (^A and ^Bw horizons)\nThis soil series classifies as an Ultisol due to diagnostic horizons that typically occur at the base of the human-transported materials and the whole soil profile is considered for classification.  Some pedons have an argillic horizons in a buried soil and are included in this concept at this time.\nSome pedons have redoximorphic features in the human transported materials, these are thought to be relict features not indicative of a water table."
