  "OVERVIEW": "The Niwot series consists of deep, somewhat poorly to poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvial parent materials overlying beds of sand and gravel. Niwot soils are on flood plains or low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 cm and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
