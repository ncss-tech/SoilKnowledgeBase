  "OVERVIEW": "The Nebago series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to clayey lacustrine deposits. These soils formed in sandy deposits and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits on glacial lake basins. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 710 mm (28 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Nebago soils were formerly mapped as Rimer soils but the absence of an argillic horizon in the sandy mantle and in the lower clayey deposits is outside the range of the Rimer series. The soils of this series are arenic, but a subgroup of Aquic Arenic Dystric Eutrudepts is not provided for in Soil Taxonomy.\n11/2006 - All of the acres correlated in Waupaca and Waushara Counties and most of the acres correlated in Winnebago County are formed in sandy deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits. Therefore, this revision limits the series concept to sandy deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits only. However, some of the acres correlated in Winnebago County are in drainageways in till uplands and are sandy deposits over clayey till. A new series may be needed for these acres.\nThere are 1750 acres of Nebago, sandy substratum phase correlated as a consociation in Waupaca County and another 498 acres in the Borth-Nebago-Meehan complex. A new series may be needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); cambic horizon - 81 to 117 cm (32 to 46 inches) (2Bw, 3Bw, 3BC); Dystric feature  no carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches); aquic feature  redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation within 61 cm (24 inches) of the soil surface."
