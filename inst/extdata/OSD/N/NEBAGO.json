    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nebago soils are in broad glacial lake basins on slightly elevated sand knolls and ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The soil is formed in sandy deposits and the underlying reddish clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 740 mm (25 to 29 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6.7 to 8.9 degrees C (44 to 48 degrees F)."

The moderately well drained Borth soils, somewhat poorly drained Zittau soils, and poorly drained Poy soils are nearby in glacial lake basins. These soils are clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Moderately well drained Brems soils, which are sandy throughout, occupy slightly higher positions on the landscape. Well drained Kewaunee soils, somewhat poorly drained Manawa soils, and poorly drained Poygan soils occupy nearby areas on the till plain. These soils are clayey throughout."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the sandy mantle and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the clayey lacustrine deposits. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or slow in the clayey lacustrine deposits."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Nebago soils were formerly mapped as Rimer soils but the absence of an argillic horizon in the sandy mantle and in the lower clayey deposits is outside the range of the Rimer series. The soils of this series are arenic, but a subgroup of Aquic Arenic Dystric Eutrudepts is not provided for in Soil Taxonomy.\n11/2006 - All of the acres correlated in Waupaca and Waushara Counties and most of the acres correlated in Winnebago County are formed in sandy deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits. Therefore, this revision limits the series concept to sandy deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits only. However, some of the acres correlated in Winnebago County are in drainageways in till uplands and are sandy deposits over clayey till. A new series may be needed for these acres.\nThere are 1750 acres of Nebago, sandy substratum phase correlated as a consociation in Waupaca County and another 498 acres in the Borth-Nebago-Meehan complex. A new series may be needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); cambic horizon - 81 to 117 cm (32 to 46 inches) (2Bw, 3Bw, 3BC); Dystric feature  no carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches); aquic feature  redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation within 61 cm (24 inches) of the soil surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
