The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 37 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick.  Depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 48 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is greater than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon (not an albic horizon) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is stony or very stony sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam. Rock fragment content is 35 to 65 percent, mostly of angular pebbles, cobbles, stones and boulders.  It is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is very stony or very cobbly clay loam, sandy clay loam or loam.  The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay, 10 to 40 percent silt, and 30 to 65 percent sand.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 65 percent, mostly of angular pebbles, cobbles, stones and boulders.

In addition, the following series may be competitors when CEC activity classes are updated: the Dunckley, Lucky Star, Norway Flat, and Schuster series.  Dunckley and Nordic soils have a mean summer soil temperature of greater than 47 degrees F.  Lucky Star soils have rock fragments consisting mainly of pebbles and cobbles and have summer soil temperatures greater than 47 degrees F.  Schuster soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR in the Bt and have summer soil temperatures greater than 47 degrees.  Norway Flat soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nordicol soils are on mountain slopes and mesa side slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  The soils formed in stony, medium textured slope alluvium and colluvium weathered mainly from sandstone, limestone, shale, and volcanic rocks.  Elevation ranges from 7,800 to 11,200 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 34 inches, and about two-thirds of this is snow.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 32 to 42 degrees F., and mean summer temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F. The frost free period is 45 to 70 days."
