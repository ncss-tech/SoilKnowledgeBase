The climate is subhumid mesothermal with mean annual rainfall of 25 to 35 inches, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 to 63 degrees F., average January temperature about 42 degrees F., and average July temperature about 80 degrees F.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED soils:  Newtown soils occur in the same general area as the Churn, Corning, Igo, Newville, Perkins, Red Bluff and Redding soils."
