They formed in glacial till of mixed mineralogy consisting largely of argillite.  The soils are in a continental climate.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 15 inches; the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.; and the frost free season is 130 to 150 days."

Haley soils have a coarse, loamy over sandy or sandy, skeletal control section.  Nighthawk soils have an aridic moisture regime and contain secondary lime within 40 inches of the surface. Vallan soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches."
