  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  Reaction of the surface horizon ranges from neutral to strongly acid and strongly to very strongly acid in the Bt horizons.\nDepth to horizons with 5 to 30 percent nodular plinthite is 26 to 55 inches.  Up to 10 percent nodules of ironstone occur in horizons with plinthite.  Nodules of ironstone ranging in diameter from 1/4 inch to 2 inches make up 5 to 25 percent by volume of horizons above the horizons with plinthite.  Pockets may contain up to 45 percent nodules of ironstone.  Few flakes of mica occur in the lower part of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5,  and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe E or EB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam; or their gravelly analogues.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe Btc horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Some pedons have reddish, yellowish, or brownish mottles.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, or their gravelly analogues.  Clay content of the textural control section is 20 to 35 percent and silt is 20 percent or more.\nThe Btv horizon has the same color range as the overlying Btc horizon and also includes 2.5YR 5/8.  In most pedons the lower Btv horizon is mottled in shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray.  Texture of the Btv horizon is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam."

Ardilla, Baxterville, Beauregard, Bowie, Clarendon, Cowarts, Dothan, Malbis, Poarch, Saucier, Varina, and Vaucluse soils contain less\nthan 5 percent ironstone nodules.  In addition, Ardilla, Beauregard, Clarendon, Irvington, and Saucier soils have mottles of chroma 2 or less within 30 inches of the surface.  Carnegie, Cowarts, and Sunsweet soils contain more than 5 percent nonindurated plinthite at depths less than 24 inches.  Cowarts, Dothan, and Tifton soils have less than 20 percent silt in their control sections.  Freemanville, Sunsweet, and Varina soils have more than 35 percent clay in their control sections.  Poarch soils contain less than 18 percent clay in their control sections.  Vaucluse soils have less than 5 percent plinthite."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Notcher soils are on level to gently sloping uplands of the Coastal Plain.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in Coastal Plain sediments of sandy clay\nloams, loams, and clay loams.  The climate is warm and humid. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 67 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 63 inches."
