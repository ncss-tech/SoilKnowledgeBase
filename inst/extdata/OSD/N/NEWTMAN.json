  "REVDATE": "05/2011",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Newtman series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, depressions and marshes.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
