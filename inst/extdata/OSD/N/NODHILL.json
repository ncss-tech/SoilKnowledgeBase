    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft weakly cemented sediments ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The moisture control section of 7 to 23 inches is moist from January 1 to May 1 and dry from June 1 to October 15 in most years.  The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F from February 15 to December 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.  The control section has from 25 to 35 percent clay content.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent.  The whole profile is moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/4; 2.5Y 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, or 5/4.  It is loam or silt loam.  The clay content ranges from 20 to 27 percent.  Some pedons do not have coarse fragments.  It is strongly or violently effervescent.  Some pedons do not have secondary lime.\nThe Btk horizon is 7.5YR 6/4; 10YR 7/4; 2.5Y 5/6,or 6/4.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 5/6; 2.5Y 4/4, 4/6,or 5/4.  It is loam, or clay loam.  The clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent but is always more than 1.2 times greater than the A horizon.  Some pedons do not have coarse fragments.  It is violently effervescent but some pedons lack concretions.\nThe Bk horizon is 7.5YR 5/4; 10 YR 6/6; 2.5Y 5/6, 6/4, 7/2, 7/4,or 7/6.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 5/6; 2.5Y 5/4, 5/6,or 6/4.  It is loam, gravelly loam or clay loam.  The clay content ranges from 20 to 32 percent.  Some pedons do not have coarse fragments.\nCOMPETING SERIES; These are Accelerator, Arbuckle, Blasingame, Bordon, Bressa, Creviscreek, Esparto, Fallbrook, Montpellier, Pomo, Ramona, Sesame, Snelling, Tivy, Wasioja and Wyman series.  Accelerator and Arbuckle are over 40 inches to paralithic contact, have pHs below 7.8, and are non-effervescent.  Blasingame has pHs below 7.8, are non-effervescent and have 5YR hues.  Borden is over 40 inches to paralithic contact, has pHs below 7.8, is slightly effervescent and has slopes of less than 5 percent.  Bressa has pHs below 7.8, is not effervescent in the surface, has hues to 5YR.  (precipitation. 20-40 inches), and has slopes steeper than 30 percent.  Creviscreek is moderately well drained and has pHs below 7.3.  Esparto has a lithic contact below 40 inches, has pHs below 7.3 is non-effervescent and has slopes below 5 percent.  Fallbrook has a paralithic contact below 40 inches, coarser surfaces textures with less than 20 percent clay content (Granitic PM) and has 5YR hues in the subsoil.  Montpellier, Ramona and Wyman are deeper than 60 inches, have pHs below 7.3 and are non-effervescent with 5YR hues in the B horizon.  Pomo has a lithic contact below 40 inches, pHs below 7.2 and is non-effervescent, with slopes as steep as 50 percent.  Seasame has weathered parent rock (Granite), pHs below 7.3 and is non-effervescent, with  slopes steeper than 30 percent.  Snelling is deeper than 60 inches, has pHs below 7.8, is non-effervescent, and has coarser surface textures with less than 20 percent clay content.  Tivy is deeper than 60 inches, has pHs below 7.3 and is non-effervescent, with chromas below 3.  Wasioja is deeper than 60 inches, is non-effervescent, has less than 20 percent clay in parts of the A horizon, and has slopes steeper than  30 percent.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING;  Nodhill soils are on dissected terraces and hillslopes of foothills with 5 to 30 percent slopes.  Elevations range from 1,440 to 2,213 feet.  The soils have formed in materials weathered from dense unconsolidated, calcareous gravelly sediments of the Tulare formation. They are usually underlain by soft sandstones and soft shales of the Panoche formation at depth greates than 60 inches.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 81 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F and the mean July temperature is 81 degrees F  The frost free season is 220 to 245 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS;  These are the Exclose (T) and the Grazer (T) soils.  Exclose soils are very deep and are on hillslopes only.  They are in a lower physiographic position being formed in the Panoche formation which is below the Tulare formation.  The Grazer soils are deep, clayey and underlain with soft shales at 40 to 60 inches.  They are in hillslopes of a lower physiographic position being formed in the Panoche formation which is below the Tulare formation.\nDRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY;  Well drained, medium to rapid runoff, moderate permeability.\nUSE AND VEGETATION;  These soils are used as rangeland, and for recreation and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation is soft chess, red brome, pine bluegrass, ripgut brome, filaree, cheatgrass, goldenbush, snakeweed, Mormon-tea ephedra and atriplex\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT;  These soils are in the Coast Range of California.  They are not extensive in MLRA-15."
