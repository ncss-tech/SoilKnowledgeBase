    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING;  Nodhill soils are on dissected terraces and hillslopes of foothills with 5 to 30 percent slopes.  Elevations range from 1,440 to 2,213 feet.  The soils have formed in materials weathered from dense unconsolidated, calcareous gravelly sediments of the Tulare formation. They are usually underlain by soft sandstones and soft shales of the Panoche formation at depth greates than 60 inches.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The precipitation is 9 to 13 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 81 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F and the mean July temperature is 81 degrees F  The frost free season is 220 to 245 days."
