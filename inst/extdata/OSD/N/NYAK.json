  "OVERVIEW": "The Nyak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments.  The Nyak soils are on lake plains, beach plains and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
