  "STATES": "CO,SD,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Norka series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in thick, calcareous, eolian or alluvial materials high in very fine sand.  Norka soils are on hills, ridges, slope breaks and valley sideslopes and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches). Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.)",
