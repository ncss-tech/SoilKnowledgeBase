  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and the mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist and is dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for a period of less than 45 consecutive days.  Faint redox concentrations are below a depth of 20 inches in some pedons.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section has 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Lenses of coarser textured material are in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 25 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe BC horizon, when present, is similar to the Bw horizon.  It has 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon, when present, is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  In some areas, texture is very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam below a depth of 40 inches with 12 to 20 percent clay."

The soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured mixed alluvial materials.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches.  The frost-free period is 160 to 300 days.  Nehalem soils occur on the Ingram geomorphic surface."
