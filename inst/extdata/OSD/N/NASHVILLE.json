    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to about 40 inches and corresponds to the depth to the Cr horizon.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is predominantly silt loam.  It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has 2.5YR or 5YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, with a moist crushed value greater than 3.5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is predominantly silt loam ranging between 18 to about 27 percent clay.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Cr horizon is soft red to reddish brown siltstone which is interbedded with sandstone in some areas."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Nashville series is the only series in its family.  Competing series in other families are the Canadian, Crisfield, Grant, Lucien, Minco, Nash, Pond Creek, Quinlan, and Woodward series.  Canadian, Crisfield, Grant, Minco, and Pond Creek soils lack shale within depths of 40 inches.  In addition, Crisfield and Canadian soils are coarse-loamy; Pond Creek and Grant soils have argillic horizons; and Minco soils are coarse-silty.  Lucian and Quinlan soils have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches.  Nash soils are coarse-silty.  Woodward soils have a calcareous control section and lack a mollic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nashville soils are on nearly level to sloping erosional uplands.  Slope gradients typically average between 1 and 5 percent but range from 0 to 12 percent.  The soil is formed in residuum from siltstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 62 degrees F.  Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index ranges from 44 to 60.  Frost free days range from 190 to 230.  Elevation ranges from 900 to 1500 feet."
