The moderately well drained and well drained Winneconne soils and the poorly drained Menasha soils form a drainage sequence with the Neenah soils.  The Winneconne soils occupy slightly higher areas than Neenah soils and Menasha soils are in lower-lying areas.  The poorly drained Poy soils are nearby where the clayey lacustrine deposits are underlain by sand at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)."
