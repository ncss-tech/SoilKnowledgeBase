  "OVERVIEW": "The Noxville series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in residuum derived from limestone. These gently sloping soils occur on interfluves of ridges on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 17.8 degrees C (64 degrees F).",
