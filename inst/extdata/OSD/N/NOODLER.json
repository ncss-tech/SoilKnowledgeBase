  "OVERVIEW": "The Noodler series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in dominantly volcanic alluvium derived from mixed sources. Noodler soils are on fan remnants and fan piedmonts. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
