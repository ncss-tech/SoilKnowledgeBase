  "OVERVIEW": "The Nerwoods series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in colluvium overlying loess and calcareous loamy glacial till on footslopes and drainways on sloping uplands. The permeability is moderate in the upper material and moderately slow in the underlying glacial till. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
