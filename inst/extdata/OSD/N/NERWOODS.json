    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 24 inches. The depth to the loess ranges from 10 to 16 inches. The depth to the underlying calcareous loamy glacial till ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Free carbonates occur at depths of 40 to 80 inches. Gravel is typically absent in the upper sediment but ranges from 2 to 12 percent, by volume, in the underlying glacial till.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 3. It is typically loam but includes silt loam high in sand content. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2A horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 3. It is typically silt loam but ranges to silty clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a sand or gravelly sand layer at the contact with the glacial till.\nThe 3Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay loam or loam. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 3Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam.

Amana, Grantcenter, Joy, Kingston, Lakefield, Larpentuer, Minden, Muscatine and Primghar soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity with dense till at depth of 40 to 60 inches. Klinger soils do not have dense till Cd horizons within a depth of 40 to 60 inches and have less sand in the upper one third of the series control section. Ransom soils have carbonates above a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Nerwoods soils formed in colluvium overlying loess and calcareous loamy glacial till on footslopes and drainways on sloping uplands. Slope gradients range from 0 to about 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F. Frost-free period ranges from 135 to 165 days. The elevation ranges from 900 to 1400 feet above sea level."

The very poorly drained Epsom soils are at lower landscape positions on floodplains and drainways and have a mollic epipedon 24 to 60 inches thick. The moderately well drained Kenyon soils are at higher landscape positions on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains and have rock fragments in the upper third of the series control section. The well drained Racine soils are at higher landscape positions on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains and have an ochric epipedon."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include - mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to 18 inches (Ap and 2A horizons); Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 65 inches (2Bw1, 2Bw2, 2Bw3, 3Bw4, 3BC horizons); Aquic subgroup based on color below the mollic. The C horizon is considered as dense till by data analyzed within the confines of MLRA 104.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to National Soil Survey Center Pedon 92P 4481-4487 and MAES Central File Code No. 4442 for results of some laboratory analysis near the typical pedon.
