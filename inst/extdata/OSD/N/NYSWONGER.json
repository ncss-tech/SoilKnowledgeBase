  "OVERVIEW": "The Nyswonger series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Nyswonger soils are on fans, stream terraces, and alluvial valley floors.  Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are broadly stratified throughout the profile.  The C1 horizon may include some thin layers of fine sandy loam.  The C2g horizon may have very thin layers of sandy clay loam.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 19 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is usually broadly stratified clay, clay loam, and sandy clay loam, with thin lenses of fine sandy loam.  It's weighted average is 28 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume throughout the profile but are usually less than 5 percent.  They are 2 to 7 mm in diameter.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges 49 to 51 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F.  The moisture control section is dry for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to June 15 when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  It is not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for as long as 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice to October 20, and for as long as 90 cumulative days during the period.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, and 2 to 4 moist with chroma of 2 to 4."

Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  At the type location the average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  These soils are in a climatic setting that receives the annual precipitation in an evenly distributed pattern throughout the year with over 50 percent received as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F, and the mean annual summer temperature is 65 to 69 degrees F.  Elevations are 4,900 to 6,800 feet.  The frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."
