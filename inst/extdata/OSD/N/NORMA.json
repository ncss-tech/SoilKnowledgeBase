It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  It has moderate fine or medium granular structure.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe 2Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has prominent redox concentrations with high values and chromas.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2Cg horizon has variegated colors and is sandy loam or loamy sand. It is very gravelly loamy sand to silty clay loam below 40 inches in some pedons.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in old alluvium and have 0 to 3 percent slopes.  Average January temperature is 38 degrees, average July temperature is 64 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 50 degree F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 60 inches, most of which falls as rain during the winter months.  The frost-free season ranges from 160 to 200 days.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 200 to 240 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  At 0 to 9 inch depth the percent of volcanic glass is estimated to be >5 and percent by ammonium-oxalate extract is >0.4.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the surface to 9 inches and a gleyed cambic horizon from 9 to 28 inches.  The base saturation (by NH4OAc) of these soils is assumed to increase to more than 50 percent within 60 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
