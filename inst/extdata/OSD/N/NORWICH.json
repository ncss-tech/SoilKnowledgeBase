  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth of the top of the fragipan ranges from 25 to 61 cm (10 to 24 inches). Solum thickness ranges from 91 to 152 cm (36 to 60 inches) or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm (60 inches). Some pedons have contrasting layers of locally derived material as much as 51 cm (20 inches) thick above the fragipan. Rock fragments are predominantly flat sandstone and siltstone, and range from 0 to 35 percent above the Bx horizons and from 15 to 45 percent in the Bx and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma 1 or 2. Texture is loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Reaction ranges from strongly to slightly acid.\nThe Eg or Bg horizons have hue 2.5YR to 5Y, value 4 to 7, and chroma 0 to 2. Texture is loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky structure or they are massive. Reaction ranges from strongly to slightly acid.\nThe Bx or 2Bx horizons have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. Matrix colors with chroma of 3 occur below depths of 30 inches. They are sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Structure is very coarse prismatic, peds part to platy or blocky structure or they are massive. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid. Thin clay films are present in pores, and are patchy on some peds.\nThe C or 2C horizon is similar to the Bx horizon in matrix color and in texture, but is less brittle. It is massive, with or without plate-like divisions. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. The boundary between the Bx horizon and C horizon is gradual or diffuse."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chippewa series in the same family. Chippewa soils have hue of 10YR through 5Y in the fragipan.\nThe Cougar, Erie, Menlo, Morris, Volusia, and Edgemere series are in related families. Cougar soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Erie, Menlo, Morris, and Volusia soils have some horizon between the Ap and 30 inches which have dominant chroma of more than 2. Edgemere soils are loamy-skeletal and have less clay than Norwich soils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: They are on low relief till plains, in depressions, and in seeps. They form in till derived from reddish sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 795 to 1725 mm (31 to 68 inches), but can range as high as 1790mm (70 inches) in higher elevations. Mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F), but in some higher elevations it can range as low as 4 degrees C (39 degrees F). The frost-free season ranges from 105 to 180 days. These soils generally occur at elevation between 100 to 670 m (328 to 2,198 ft) above sea level, but have been mapped as high as 750 m (2,460 ft) in some areas."

Future work should include redescribing this location (or locating another pedon) to a depth greater than 152 cm (60 inches) for the very deep class.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Albic horizon - from 9 to 15 inches (Eg horizon).\n3. Fragipan - from 15 to 50 inches (Bxg horizon).\n4. Aquic moisture regime - depleted matrix and redoximorphic accumulations in upper 50 cm of pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
