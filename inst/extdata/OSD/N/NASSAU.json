  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 25 to 50 cm. Rock fragments are mainly slate and shale with content ranging from 10 to 50 percent by volume in the Ap horizon and 35 to 70 percent in the B horizon. Rock fragments are mainly channers, but includes 0 to 20 percent flagstones in the A horizon and 0 to 25 percent flagstones below. Some areas are very stony or extremely stony.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or fine granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid. Some pedons have thin O horizons that are extremely acid or very acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or fine subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nSome thicker pedons have thin C or 2Cr horizons immediately above the bedrock. C or 2Cr horizons have a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 6.  The C horizon has similar textures, rock fragment content, and reaction to the Bw horizon.  The 2Cr horizon consists of highly fractured soft weathered bedrock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Arnot, Klinesville, Sylvatus, and Weikert series are in the same family. Arnot soils are dominated by siltstone and sandstone rock fragments. Klinesville soils have hues of 5YR or redder throughout. Sylvatus soils formed in residuum and have rock fragments that are dominantly metasedimentary phylitte. Weikert soils have 10 to 40 percent of the clay fraction dominated by kaolinite.\nThe Benson, Berks, Manlius, and Palatine soils are similar soils in related families. Benson soils have greater than 60 percent base saturation. Berks and Manlius soils have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm. Palatine soils have mollic epipedons and are 50 to 100 cm deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nassau soils are nearly level to steep soils on bedrock-controlled, glacially modified landforms. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. They formed in till derived mainly from local slate or shale similar to that of the R horizon. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C., mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1,270 mm, and mean annual frost-free season ranges from 130 to 190 days. The elevation ranges from 45 to 275 meters above sea level."

Chippewa, Manlius and Venango are typically associated in the extreme southern portions of MLRA 144A. Bath, Chippewa, Erie, Mardin, Marilla and Venango are very deep soils that contain fragipans. Bernardston and Pittstown are very deep soils with C horizons in dense, very firm basal till. Darien soils are very deep somewhat poorly drained soils that contain argillic horizons.  Dutchess soils are very deep and have a coarse loamy particle size. Hudson and Rhinebeck soils are very deep clayey soils that are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained, respectively. Manlius soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to bedrock."
