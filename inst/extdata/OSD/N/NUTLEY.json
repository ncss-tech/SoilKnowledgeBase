  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil typically contains free calcium carbonate to the surface, but it it is absent to depths of 8 to 10 inches in some pedons.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to l6 inches and in some pedons extends into the Bss horizon.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  The control section is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or clay loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bss horizon has 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue; value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is clay or silty clay, but is silty clay loam in some pedons. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Dark tongues ranging from 1/4 to 1 inch in thickness with 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2, extend through the Bss horizon.  Some pedons have tongues extending into the C to depths of more than 24 inches.\nSome pedons have a BC or Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 6 or 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons do not have inherent redoximorphic features throughout the C horizon.  Crystals of gypsum are in some pedons.  The C horizon below depths of about 36 inches is laminated in some pedons.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The Nutley soils formed in calcareous clayey glaciolacustrine sediments.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 110 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

Sinai soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick and are on smooth nearly level to gently sloping areas in close association with the Nutley soils.  The Barnes, Buse, Forman, and Poinsett soils are on nearby uplands.  The Barnes, Buse, and Forman soils have a fine-loamy control section.  In addition, Forman soils have an argillic horizon. Poinsett soils have a fine-silty control section."
