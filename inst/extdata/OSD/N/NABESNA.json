  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the 0 horizon ranges from 4 to 10 inches. Thickness of the stone-free upper horizon ranges from 0 to 15 inches. In the Northway Area, this may consist in part of volcanic ash.  Some pedons have an A1 horizon less than 2 inches thick. Chromas in the C horizon range from 1 to 3. Depth to permafrost ranges from 5 to 24 inches, depending on thickness of the 0 horizon and coarseness of the upper mineral horizons."

The Ester soils are highly micaceous. The Fairplay soils have thin 0 horizons, generally higher chromas, and are not as stony. The Cheshnina soils are stony, but are well drained, The Utopia soils are dark and very stony."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Nabesna soils occur principally on gently sloping to steep high hills and north-facing escarpments. They are formed in stony colluvial or residual silty materials over bedrock. The climate is subarctic continental, with long cold winters and short warm summers. Annual precipitation is low."

The Ladue and Frindle soils have brown silty sola with a volcanic ash overburden. The Hughes soils have brown silty sola. The McGrath soils are silty and have a thin spodic horizon.  The Aniak soils have thin sola with dark surface horizons and brown B horizons. All of these are well drained.  The Batza soils are silty, have moderately high chromas, and are somewhat poorly drained."
