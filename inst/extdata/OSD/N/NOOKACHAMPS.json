Depth to the apparent water table is 0 to 18 inches during the wet season.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, chroma of 1, 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or N, value of 4 through 7 moist and dry and chroma of 0, 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y or N, value of 5 through 7 moist and dry and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The thin strata of peat material are lacking in some pedons.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Birds, Killbuck, Melvin, Petrolia, Rafton, Skagit and Woodinville series.  Birds, Killbuck, Melvin, and Petrolia soils are in a climate with greater difference in summer and winter temperature and that receive most of the precipitation in spring and summer. Also, Birds soils have hue of 10YR and lack a B horizon.  Killbuck soils have a buried dark colored A horizon in the control section.  Melvin soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 59 degrees F.  Petrolia soils lack a B horizon.  Rafton soils are saturated throughout the year and are flooded by fresh water during high tides unless diked and drained.  Woodinville soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick and are medium acid to very strongly acid in the control section.  Skagit soils have over 20 percent volcanic glass in the control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on stream floodplains at elevations of 45 to 250 feet.  They formed in alluvium derived mainly from phyllite and lacustrine material from ponded stream overflow.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F. and mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 210 days."
