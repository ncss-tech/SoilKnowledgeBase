  "OVERVIEW": "The Nesda series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium. These soils are on floodplains, flood-plain steps, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
