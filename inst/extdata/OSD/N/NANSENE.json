  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: In most years the soils are usually moist but are dry throughout the control section for 70 to 90 consecutive days within the 4 months following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. Depth to basalt is 40 to more than 60 inches. The profile is silt loam throughout to depth of 40 inches and has 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. There are 0 to 5 percent fragments of basalt 1 inch or less in diameter in the control section and up to 5 percent larger fragments mostly on the surface. Up to 10 percent of the surface has exposed bedrock in some areas. The mollic epipedon ranges from 30 to 50 inches thick. The solum has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 1 thru 3 dry. It has weak thin platy, weak fine granular to weak coarse prismatic structure. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has weak, coarse, or medium prismatic structure. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, when present, has value of 4 through 7 dry and 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. Below depth of 43 inches it is weakly calcareous in some pedons. Some pedons have a BC horizon with colors like the C horizon or a Bk horizon below a depth of 40 inches. It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

The soils formed in loess. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean winter temperature is 33 to 37 degrees F.; the mean summer temperature is 63 to 67 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 15 inches. The frost-free period is 135 to 180 days."

Anderly soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and are on plateaus and side slopes. Dufur soils are coarse-loamy and are on south-facing slopes. Lickskillet soils are skeletal, less than 20 inches deep and are on steep to very steep south-facing slopes on canyons. Rhea soils are fine-silty and calcareous and are on plateaus and side slopes. Ritzville soils are on south-facing slopes of plateaus, canyons, and hills, usually dry, and have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick. Wato soils are coarse-loamy, have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and are on upland terraces. Walla Walla soils have a mollic epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick and are on hillslopes. Wrentham soils are skeletal and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and are on canyon slopes."
