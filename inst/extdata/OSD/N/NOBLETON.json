All these soils have loamy particle class and siliceous mineralogy.  Fuquay, Lucy, Ocilla, Stilson, and Wagram soils have temperatures less than 72 degrees F. at depths 20\ninches below the soil surface.  In addition, Blichton, Fuquay, Jumper, Leefield, and Stilson soils have more than 5 percent plinthite within depths of 60 inches below the soil surface.  Kendrick, Lucy, and Wagram soils lack chroma 2 mottles in the\nupper 5 inches of the argillic horizon.  Sparr soils have A\nhorizons 40 to 80 inches thick."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Large areas of these soils are cleared.  Improved pasture is the dominant use.  Some cleared areas are used for citrus, tomatoes, corn, peanuts, and watermelons.  Native vegetation consists of slash and longleaf pines, hickory,\nmagnolia, sweetgum, and live, laurel, and water oaks.  Understory vegetation is southern bayberry, briers, and native grasses.
