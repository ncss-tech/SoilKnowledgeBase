  "OVERVIEW": "The Nobleton series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in thick sandy and loamy sediments of marine origin.  These soils are on broad nearly level and gently sloping coastal plain areas in Peninsular\nFlorida.  They have a perched water table above the argillic\nhorizon during the summer rainy season.  Water runs off the\nsurface slowly.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.",
