  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist; they are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 110 consecutive days. In MLRA 2, the soils are dry 45 to 70 consecutive days. In MLRA 5, the soils are dry for 70 to 110 days. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 55 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The particle-size control section averages loamy very fine sand or sandy loam and lacks contrasting texture. Depth to loamy fine sand containing less than 50 percent fine and coarser sand ranges from 25 to 40 inches or more. Coarse fragments in the particle-size control section range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or sandy loam. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry. Texture of the C1 horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Texture of the C2 and C3 horizon is stratified fine sandy loam to fine sand. It typically has 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Very gravelly, extremely gravelly or sandy substrata are below 40 inches in some pedons. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

The Malo soils are neutral to moderately alkaline and have a mean annual soil temperature of 48 degrees F. The Martini soils are moderately calcareous. Floutier soils have silt loam or gravelly silt loam textures in the Bw horizon. Wistona soils are slightly to strongly alkaline in the B horizon and are dry for 90 to 120 days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Newberg soils are on flood plains at elevations of 10 to 3,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. They formed in loamy and sandy alluvium derived from sedimentary and basic igneous rocks. Summers are dry and warm and winters are moist and cool. The mean annual precipitation is typically 40 to 60 inches but may be as low as 18 inches and as high as 70 inches in some areas. The mean January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 235 days."

Chapman soils are fine-loamy and have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches. Chehalis soils are fine-silty and have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches. Cloquato soils are coarse-silty and have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches. Chapman, Chehalis, and Cloquato soils are on slightly higher flood plains. McBee soils are moderately well drained. Wapato soils are poorly drained. McBee and Wapato soils are in depressions on flood plains. Pilchuck soils are sandy and are on bar positions."
