    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 4 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 4 to 17 inches (Bt horizon)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 31 to 46 inches (Ck horizon)\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data on the modal pedon indicates the texture of the argillic horizon is loamy fine sand.  The texture of the argillic horizon was estimated in the field as fine sandy loam.  The particle-size class appears better as sandy but is marginal to coarse-loamy in some pedons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
