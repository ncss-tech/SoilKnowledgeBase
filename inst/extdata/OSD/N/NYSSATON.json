    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Portino series.  The following series are assumed to be in this family when re-classified.  These are the Bahem, Bram, Idahome, and Pogal series.  Bahem and Idahome soils lack laminated lake sediments within 40 inches.  Bram soils have a fluctuating water table at depths of 3 to 6 feet for several months.  Pogal soils have more than 40 percent exchangeable sodium within 30 inches of the surface.  Portino soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nyssaton soils are level to moderately steep on low and medium terraces and steep and very steep terrace escarpments in Washington at elevations of 1,000 to 2,700 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent in Idaho and up to 65 percent in Washington, but are dominantly less than 7 percent.  These soils formed in silty calcareous laminated lacustrine material influenced in the upper part by local alluvium and loess.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 12 inches.  Average annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days."

Owyhee soils lack the calcium carbonates above laminae and have a cambic horizon.  Scism soils have a continuous duripan that is 20 to 40 inches deep."
