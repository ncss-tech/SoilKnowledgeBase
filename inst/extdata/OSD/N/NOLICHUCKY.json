    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum exceeds 60 inches.  Reaction in each horizon is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer where limed.  Rock fragment rage from 0 to 30 percent in each horizon.  The fragments are mostly rounded sandstone and quartzite pebbles and cobbles.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Severely eroded areas also have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, and chroma of 6 or 8. Some pedons have A horizons less than 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The fine earth fraction of the A and Ap horizons is sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  Severely eroded areas are also sandy clay loam.\nE horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine earth is sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR and 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay."

Brocket soils have a clay decrease in the lower part of the Bt horizon and have pockets of uncoated sand grains.  Claiborne soils have fragments of chert in the series control section.  Trimble soils have hue of 10YR and lack sandstone and quartzite pebbles or cobbles.  Allen, Brandon, Etowah, Holston and Minvale soils are thermic.  Jefferson soils have hue of 10YR in the B horizon and the solum is less than 60 inches.  Shouns soils have less clay in the lower part of the Bt horizon and have mixed mineralogy."
