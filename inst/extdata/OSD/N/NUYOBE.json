(thin layers of volcanic ash have chroma of 1).\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 18 to 27 percent. When mixed has less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nA horizons\nReaction:  Strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.\nBk horizons\nTexture: Stratified very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam.\nStructure: Platy or massive.\nConsistence: Soft or slightly hard dry, slightly sticky or sticky and slightly plastic or plastic.\nReaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
