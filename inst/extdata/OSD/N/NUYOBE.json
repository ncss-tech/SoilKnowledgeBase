  "OVERVIEW": "The Nuyobe series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments from mixed rock sources and volcanic ash.  Nuyobe soils are on alluvial flats, drainageways, lake plains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
