  "OVERVIEW": "TH� �QRl�-AY FLAT series corsist of very deep, medium to moderately coarse\ntextured, well to somewhat excessively drained Gray Wooded intergrading to\nBrunizem soils. These soils are formed in thick, glacial deposits of quartzite, sandstone, and shale composition on gently sloping glacial moraines\noutwash terraces and fans. The t�pical horizon sequence is Al, A2, A2B2, and\nB2. THE NORWhY FLAT soils are associated with and similar to Soapstone (Gray\nWooded Intergrading to Brunizem), Ledgefork (regosolic Brunizen), and Lovena\n(planosolic Brunizem) soils, and are similar to, but not associated with, soils\nof the Duchesne (minimal Gray Wooded) and Broad Canyon (minimal Brunizem) soils.      1l\nThe Soapstone soils have medium to moderately fine textured B2 horizons, and          t\noverlie shale. The Ledgefork soils lack B2 horizons and have light-colored\nAl horizons. The Lovena soils have cobbly clay loam to clay B2 horizons.  The\nDuchesne soils lack Al horizon� NOR�AY FLAT soils are at elevations of 7,500\nto �,500 feet in the lower �anadian climatic zone. The mean annual precipita-\ntion ranges from 20 to 25 inches. �ost of this precipitation is snow.  Sum-\nmers are dry and moderately warm with a wide diurnal temperature range.  These soils are not extensive.",
