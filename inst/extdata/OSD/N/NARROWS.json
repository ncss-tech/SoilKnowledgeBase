  "OVERVIEW": "The Narrows series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits.  These soils occur on flood plains, stream terraces, drainageways, depressional areas and lakebeds.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
