  "OVERVIEW": "The Nahatche series consists of very deep soils that are formed in stratified loamy alluvium. They are somewhat poorly drained and moderately permeable. These soils occur on flood plains of river valleys.   The slope range is 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F).",
