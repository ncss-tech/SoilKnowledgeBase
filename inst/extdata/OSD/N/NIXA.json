    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the fragipan is 14 to 27 inches.  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches. The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout except where surface layers are limed.  Corase fragment of chert range from 15 to 60 percent by volume in the A and E horizons, 35 to 75 percent in the Bw, E' and Bt horizons and 35 to 85 percent in the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2.  In cultivated areas, the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam with gravelly or very gravelly modifiers.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4; or value of 5, and chroma of 2.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam with gravelly or very gravelly modifiers.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6; or with value of 5, and chroma of 3.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam with very gravelly or extremely gravelly modifiers.\nThe E' horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 and 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have clay depletions of lower chroma. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam with very gravelly or extremely gravelly modifiers.  Clay content is less than that of the overlaying Bw horizon.\nThe 2Btx horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 or 6; or with value of 6, and chroma of 6; or with hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 or 6, with iron accumulation and/or depletions in shades of brown, gray, or red.  Some pedons have no dominate matrix color and are variegated in shades of brown, gray, or red.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam with very gravelly or extremely gravelly modifiers.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 with iron accumulations and/or depletions in shades red, brown, or gray.  Some pedons have no dominate matrix color and are variegated in shades of red, brown and gray.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam with very gravelly or extremely gravelly modifiers."

Arkana and Moko soils are on sideslopes at lower elevations.  They do not contain a fragipan.  Moko soils are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Arkana soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and in a very-fine particle size family.  Captina and Tonti soils typically are on broad flats with level to gentle slopes and contain less coarse fragments in the upper part.  Captina soils are in a fine-silty particle size family and Tonti soils are in a fine-loamy particle size family.  Clarksville and Noark soils are on similar sideslope postions.  They do not contain a fragipan.  Noark soils are in a clayey-skeletal particle size family.  Doniphan and Gassville soils are on similar sideslope positions.  They do not have a fragipan and both are in fine particle size familes."
