    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 80 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 37 inches.  Sand content ranges from 10 to 35 percent with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.  Reaction, except for those surface layers that have been limed, ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid above the fragipan, from slightly acid to very strongly acid in the Btx and BC horizons and from mildly alkaline to very strongly acid in the C horizon. The effective cation exchange capacity typically ranges from 15 to 50 percent, saturated with exchangeable aluminum within 30 inches of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 3.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The clay content ranges from 18 to 32 percent.  Mottles are in shades of gray, yellow, or brown.  Fine and medium black, brown, or red concretions range from few to common.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Mottles are in shades of brown or gray.  Texture is silt loam.  Fine or medium black, brown, or red concretions range from few to many.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  texture is loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  Mottles are in shades of gray, yellow, or brown.  Concretions range from none to common. The brittle matrix ranges from 60 to 80 percent of the horizontal cross section.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bude and  Calloway series in the same family and the Coteau series.  Bude and Calloway soils do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipan.  Coteau soils do not have fragipan horizons.  Also, Bude soils have less than 10 percent sand in the upper parts of the solum and Calloway soils have less than 10 percent sand throughout the solum."
