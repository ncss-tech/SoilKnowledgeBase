  "OVERVIEW": "The Necessity series consists of deep somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments on late Pleistocene age stream terraces.  These soils are on nearly level areas and on low ridges and knolls.  Slope dominantly is less than 1 percent but ranges up to 5 percent.",
