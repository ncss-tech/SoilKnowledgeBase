Doyn soils are 10 to 25 cm to a lithic contact and have an aridic moisture regime. Quicksilver soils have 6 to 15 percent clay and 25 percent or more coarse sand and very coarse sand in the particle-size control section. Sadorus soils have 5 to 12 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Spaa soils have horizons with secondary carbonates and rock fragments of travertine in the particle-size control section.  Taylow soils are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nuss soils are on hills, plateaus, and structural benches. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt, andesite, and tuff. Some areas are influenced by surface additions of volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 2,052 metrers. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 cm. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 20 to 80 days."

Booth soils are in the fine family and are 50 to 100 cm deep to bedrock. Bullump soils are loamy-skeletal and are over 100 cm deep to bedrock. Royst soils are clayey-skeletal and have bedrock at depths of 50 to 100 cm."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 38 cm (A, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 38 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 38 cm (Bw2 and part of Bw1 horizons).\nThe revision of January 2004 moves the type location from Klamath County to Harney County, Oregon to better represent the series concept as being shallow to a lithic contact. Future study is needed to determine whether Nuss soils as mapped in Klamath County are typically shallow to a paralithic contact and to determine the amount of volcanic ash influence in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe classification was changed in 1991 from Loamy, mixed, frigid, shallow Typic Haploxerolls. A lithic contact was deemed to be present below the soil that was not described in the older description.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
