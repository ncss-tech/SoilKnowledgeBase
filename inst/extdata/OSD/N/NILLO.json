They are associated with channels that receive overbank floodwaters once in 7 to 20 years for a duration of less than 2 days. Nillo soils formed in stratified loamy and clayey alluvium derived from tuffaceous rocks of the Duff and Pruett Formations. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 305 to 380 mm (12 to 14 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 16.7 to 19.4 degrees C (62 to 68 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 260 days, and elevation ranges from 1,070 to 1,525 m (3,500 to 5,000 feet)."

Gemelo soils have less than 18 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. They are on late-Holocene fan aprons. Straddlebug soils have between 18 and 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser fine sand in the particle-size control section. They are on alluvial flats and stream terraces that do not receive overbank floodwaters because stream channels are large enough to transport peak flows."
