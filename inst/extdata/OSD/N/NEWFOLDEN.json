  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches in thickness.  Depth to carbonates is 10 to 29 inches.  Depth to fine-loamy till ranges from 14 to 36 inches.  Redoximorphic depletions of 2 chroma or less occur within 1 meter of the surface.  The soil has an abrupt textural change (more than 20 percent absolute clay increase) between the A and Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  The horizon is free of rock fragments where formed in clayey lacustrine sediments and has 2 to 10 percent rock fragments of mixed lithology where formed in clayey till.  Reaction is neutral.  There are few to many clay films on exteriors of peds or in pores.  The clay films have value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have a Btk or Bk horizon.  They have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.  The horizons have 2 to 10 percent rock fragments of mixed lithology.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.   Texture is loam or clay loam. The horizon has 2 to 10 percent rock fragments of mixed lithology.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2BC, 2CBk and 2C horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, silty clay loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand. The horizons have 2 to 10 percent rock fragments of mixed lithology.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.35 to 1.60 g/cc.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Newfolden soils are on slightly convex areas on lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in water-worked clayey till or clayey glaciolacustrine sediments overlying loamy calcareous till.  These sediments are of late Wisconsin in age.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 24 inches.  Frost-free days range from 110 to 135.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 750 to 1250 feet."
