Ednagrey, Meriwhitica, Redsun, Reef, and Windcomb soils have less than 18 percent clay. Andanada soils have secondary calcium carbonate in the control section. Daklos soils have sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy clay loam textures are derived from sandstone. Skos soils have hues of 2.5YR and 5YR. Teesto soils have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate. Sunup, Redsun, and Windcomb soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June. Hillburn soils are inactive."
