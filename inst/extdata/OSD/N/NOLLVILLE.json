  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments of shale, siltstone or chert range from 0 to 25 percent in the A horizon, 0 to 40 percent in the B horizon, and 25 to 75 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part of the solum and the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have a BA or BE horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay in the fine-earth.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt has a weighted average of less than 35 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture of the fine-earth is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with color and texture similar to the Bt horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amend, Belmont, Belmore, Chenault, Chili, Coggon, Conestoga, Douds, El Dara, Gallman, Grellton, Hayden, Hebron, Hickory, High Gap, Hallinger, Kalamazoo, Kanawha, Kendallville, Kidder, Kosciusko, Leroy, Letort, Lindley, Mandeville, Martinsville, McHenry, Miami, Mifflin, Millitary, Nodine, Norden, Ockley, Owosso, Pecatonica, Princeton, Rainsville, Rawson, Relay, Renova, Richardsville, Richland, Riddles, Sisson, Skelton, Strawn, Summitville, Theresa, Wawasee, Westville, Whalon, Woodbine, and Wykoff in the same family.  All of the above series are formed in glacial parent materials, except for the following:  Belmont and Summitville soils have redder hue in the Bt and C horizons.  Chenault soils are formed in old alluvium over limestone.  Conestoga, Hollinger, Letort, Mandeville, Nodine, and Richland soils are very deep to bedrock.  Kanawha and Skelton soils are formed in alluvial sediments.  Mifflin soils have more sand in the control section.  Norden soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Princeton soils are formed in coarse silt and fine sand of aeolian origin.  Relay soils are formed on crystalline bedrock.\nThe Culleoka, Duffield, Frankstown, Ryder, and Westmoreland soils are in related families.  All have lower base saturation.  In addition, Culleoka and Ryder soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Duffield soils are very deep to bedrock.  Westmoreland soils have higher mean annual precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nollville soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep convex upland ridges of low relief.  Ridges are usually long and narrow and have a general north-south orientation.  Relief is usually less than 100 feet.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from argillaceous limestone.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 42 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 54 degrees F."

Hagerstown soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizon and average more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Timberville and (Tentative) Funkstown soils are very deep and are formed in local alluvium/colluvium in concave drainageways."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\n1.  These soils were formerly mapped as members of the Frankstown or Duffield soil series.\n2.  At the type location, these soils are formed in residuum from the Elbrook Formation, a Cambrian Age argillaceous, dolomitic limestone.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Argillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 41 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons).\nThe 10/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). CEC class is based on NASIS data from Berkeley County, West Virginia. Competing series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Base saturation at the critical depth for the typical pedon is 68 percent.  Base saturation data gathered from 9 pedons supports classification.\nSIR = WV0134\nMLRA = 147\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
