  "OVERVIEW": "The Nuffel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and stream alluvium from calcareous sandstone, siltstone, shale, limestone, mudstone, and basalt.  Nuffel soils are on flood plains on valley floors, and alluvial fans on valley sides and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
