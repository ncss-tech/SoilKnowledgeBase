  "OVERVIEW": "The Nunda series consists of very deep and deep, moderately well drained soils formed in silty mantles that overlie till derived from clayey shale. These soils are on upland till plains. Permeability is moderate in the surface and upper part of the subsoil, moderately slow in the lower part of the subsoil and slow or very slow in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Aurora, Conesus, Danley, and Grindstone series are members of the same family. Aurora soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Danley soils lack a lithologic discontinuity in the particle-size control section. Grindstone soils have sola ranging from 12 to 33 inches. Conesus soils lack the silty mantle that ranges from 13 to 30 inches thick in the Nunda soils.\nCanaseraga, Cazenovia, Lima, Mohawk, Nessel, and Vlasaty are similar soils in related families. Canaseraga soils have similar surface mantles but contain a fragipan. Cazenovia soils have hues of 2.5YR to 7.5YR in the Bt horizons and lack 2 chroma redoximorphic depletions in the argillic horizon. Lima soils lack 2 chroma redoximorphic depletions in the argillic horizon. Mohawk soils have dark surfaces. Nessel soils have a clay content in the Bt horizon that is 22 to 28 percent and a maximum content of rock fragments of 8 percent. Vlasaty soils formed in a near stone free loess mantle overlying till containing a maximum of 8 percent rock fragments."

(Ap horizon)\n2) Albic - from 19 to 30 inches. (E horizon)\n3) argillic - from 30 to 45 inches. (2Bt horizon)\n4) Lithology change at 30 inches.\n5) aquic moisture regime-redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less in upper 25 cm of argillic\n6) Glossaquic subgroup - as evidenced by interfingering of albic material around pedons in the upper part of the argillic horizon (B/E horizon), and low chroma mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon."
