    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 72 inches. Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 13 to 30 inches. Rock fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 25 percent in the silty mantle and 5 to 30 percent in the underlying till. Rock fragments 3 inches or larger make up 0 to 15 percent in the surface layer, up to 5 percent in the Bw, E and B/E horizons, and 5 to 10 percent in the underlying till layers. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral in the surface layer, subsurface layer, and the upper part of the subsoil, moderately acid through neutral in the Bt and slightly acid through moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is very weak through moderate, fine or medium granular.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3 and has redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate, thin or medium platy.\nThe 2Bt/E horizons have colors and redoximorphic features similar to the E and 2Bt. Texture of the fine-earth fraction of the 2Bt/E horizon is silty clay loam or clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine and medium subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 4 with redoximorphic concentrations and/or depletions. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is dominantly silty clay loam or clay loam, but includes thin subhorizons that are loam or silt loam with clay content of 20 to 27 percent. Structure is weak or moderate prismatic or subangular blocky. Consistence is firm.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4 with redoximorphic concentrations and/or depletions. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from loam to silty clay loam. Structure is massive or has plate like divisions. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Aurora, Conesus, Danley, and Grindstone series are members of the same family. Aurora soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Danley soils lack a lithologic discontinuity in the particle-size control section. Grindstone soils have sola ranging from 12 to 33 inches. Conesus soils lack the silty mantle that ranges from 13 to 30 inches thick in the Nunda soils.\nCanaseraga, Cazenovia, Lima, Mohawk, Nessel, and Vlasaty are similar soils in related families. Canaseraga soils have similar surface mantles but contain a fragipan. Cazenovia soils have hues of 2.5YR to 7.5YR in the Bt horizons and lack 2 chroma redoximorphic depletions in the argillic horizon. Lima soils lack 2 chroma redoximorphic depletions in the argillic horizon. Mohawk soils have dark surfaces. Nessel soils have a clay content in the Bt horizon that is 22 to 28 percent and a maximum content of rock fragments of 8 percent. Vlasaty soils formed in a near stone free loess mantle overlying till containing a maximum of 8 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nunda soils are gently sloping to steep soils on glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in a silty mantle and the underlying till that is strongly influenced by calcareous clayey shale and siltstone. Some areas have very stony or extremely stony surfaces. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, mean annual air temperature from 46 degrees to 50 degrees F.; and mean growing season from 140 to 180 days."

Lansing soils are on similar landscapes but lack silt mantles."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: New pedon from Genesee County was used to reflect the Glossaquic Hapludalfs characteristic which is dominant in New York State.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches. (Ap horizon)\n2) Albic - from 19 to 30 inches. (E horizon)\n3) argillic - from 30 to 45 inches. (2Bt horizon)\n4) Lithology change at 30 inches.\n5) aquic moisture regime-redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less in upper 25 cm of argillic\n6) Glossaquic subgroup - as evidenced by interfingering of albic material around pedons in the upper part of the argillic horizon (B/E horizon), and low chroma mottles in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
