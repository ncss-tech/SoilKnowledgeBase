Added soil moisture regime, soil temperature regime, mean annual soil temperature, particle size clay and sand content. Added clay and sand content and reaction to horizon data in RIC. Added calcium carbonate equivalence to horizon data in RIC. Updated competing series. Updated geographic setting. Lowered mean annual air temperature to 10 to 13 degrees C from 12 to 14 degrees C based on climate data. Updated geographically associated soils. Added flooding frequency. Added additional data\nADDITIONAL DATA: Additional laboratory data-- National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska pedons: 81KS123001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
