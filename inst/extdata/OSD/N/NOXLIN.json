  "OVERVIEW": "The Noxlin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over mixed alluvium and glacial outwash.  These soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
