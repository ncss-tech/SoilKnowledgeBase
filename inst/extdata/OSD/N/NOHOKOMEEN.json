    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with alluvium over glacial drift.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,700 to 2,500 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C. Frost free season is 60 to 90 days."
