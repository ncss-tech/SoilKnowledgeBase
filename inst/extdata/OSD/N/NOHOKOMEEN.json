  "OVERVIEW": "The Nohokomeen series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with alluvium over glacial drift on debris aprons, terraces, debris cones and fan terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
