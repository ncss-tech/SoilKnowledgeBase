Arbor, Cresken, Kenyon, Moland and Ostrander soils have 2B horizons with more than 2 percent coarse fragments. Aredale soils have a layer of sandy loam or loamy sand. Bode, Clarion, Everly, Farrar, Frontenac, Liscomb, Ocheyedan and Rossfield soils have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section. Garmore soils have more than 2 percent coarse fragments. Limecreek soils have a paralithic contact at less than 40 inches. In addition, these competing series have cooler mean annual soil temperature."
