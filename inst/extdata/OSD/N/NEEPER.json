  "OVERVIEW": "The Neeper series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands. These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium from glacial till and loess. Slope gradients range from 2 to 7 percent. The mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",
