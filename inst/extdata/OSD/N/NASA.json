  "OVERVIEW": "The Nasa series consists of moderately deep to petrogypsic, well drained soils that formed in coarse-loamy gypsiferous eolian deposits. These gently sloping soils are on fan piedmonts, playa steps, and relict lakebeds. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
