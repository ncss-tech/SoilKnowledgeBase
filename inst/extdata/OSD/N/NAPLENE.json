  "OVERVIEW": "The Naplene series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces. Slopes are 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

Lavate soils have mollic epipedons and argillic horizon and occur upslope of the Naplene soils on fan terraces. Redbank soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and occur on upper, smaller alluvial fans. Schmutz soils have gypsic mineralogy and occur on higher alluvial fans upslope of the Naplene soils."
