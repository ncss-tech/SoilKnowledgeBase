    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Naplene soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces at elevations of 3,700 to 5,500 feet. Slopes are 1 to 6 percent. These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 160 days."

Chilton soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section and occur upslope of the Naplene soils on strongly sloping alluvial fans. Lavate soils have mollic epipedons and argillic horizon and occur upslope of the Naplene soils on fan terraces. Redbank soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and occur on upper, smaller alluvial fans. Schmutz soils have gypsic mineralogy and occur on higher alluvial fans upslope of the Naplene soils."
