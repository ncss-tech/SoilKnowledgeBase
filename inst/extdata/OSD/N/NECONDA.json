    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to a calcic horizon is 20 to 36 inches.  Depth to basalt is 22 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depth of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The family control section has 35 to 50 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and includes all or part of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  The upper part is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The lower part of Bt horizon is gravelly clay or cobbly clay.  The Bt horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 3 through 6 moist.  It is silt loam, loam, or clay loam and is very cobbly very gravelly or gravelly.  A thin Btk horizon is in some pedons just above the fractured basalt.  The Bk horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
