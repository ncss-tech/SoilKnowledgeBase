  "OVERVIEW": "The Naco series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium from quartz, sandstone and arkose.  Naco soils are on high fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
