    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Newkirk soils are on top of mesas, hillslopes, and ridges.  Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent.  They formed in material weathered mainly from sandstone.  The climate is semiarid continental.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 62 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 180 to 200 days and elevation ranges from 4,000 to 5,300 feet.   The Thornthwaite annual P. E. Index ranges from 19 to 24."
