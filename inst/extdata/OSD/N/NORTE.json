  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 61 to 64 degrees F.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  The soils range from neutral to strongly alkaline.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal 2C horizon ranges from about 24 to 40 inches.  It has 35 to 55 percent pebbles and 10 to 25 percent cobbles.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos above a depth of 24 inches except that thin subhorizons totaling less than 4 inches in thickness and containing more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium or with conductivity exceeding 14 millimhos occur inconsistently in some pedons.  The upper part of the particle size control section averages about 5 to 18 percent clay, 35 to 80 percent fine or coarser sand, and 0 to 35 percent rock fragments.  The rock fragments are mainly 1 to 10 inches in diameter.  A seasonal high water table ranges from 2.5 to 4.5 feet.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon above the 2C horizon has hue of 5Y through 6.5YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe sandy-skeletal 2C horizon has varigated gray colors with hues similar to the A and C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Norte soils are on terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous, moderately coarse textured alluvium overlying beds of sand and gravel.  The average annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months. These soils are underlain by a fluctuating water table that is highest in the summer which keeps the lower part of the moisture control section moist for periods much longer than is customary for the precipitation of the area.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F."

This soil has been correlated only in the Rio Grande County Area Soil Survey of Colorado.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
