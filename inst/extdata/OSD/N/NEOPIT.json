  "OVERVIEW": "The Neopit series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on moraines and drumlins.  They formed in mostly loamy till.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 45 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to free carbonates is more than 80 inches.  The weighted average clay content ranges from 5 to 18 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 45 to 80 percent in the particle-size control section.  Rock fragments average about 75 percent igneous and metamorphic and about 25 percent sedimentary.  The sedimentary rock fragments are mostly dolomite.  Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 15 percent in the E and Bw horizons and from 2 to 25 percent in the E', E/B, B/E, and C horizons.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil.  In most pedons, stones and boulders are on the surface and throughout the soil.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed or where fire has created ash.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.  Bulk densities are less than 1.80 throughout the solum and substratum.  Redox concentrations are within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A or Ap is loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. It is loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand, sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nNeopit soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  Typically, it is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs but in the lower part of some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs."

Feldhauser soils have lamellae (E & Bt horizons) in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Freeon soils have more than 50 percent silt in the upper 12 to 36 inches of the series control section.  Haugen soils do not have limestone coarse fragments and have bulk densities greater than 1.80 in the lower part of the argillic horizon and in the substratum..  Scott Lake soils have stratified sandy outwash within a depth of 40 inches. Amery soils do not have limestone rock fragments and have bulk densities greater than 1.80 in the lower subsoil and substratum.  Kennan soils do not have redox features or a water table."
