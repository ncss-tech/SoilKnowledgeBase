  "OVERVIEW": "The Naniak series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in coastal tidal marshes. These soils formed in alluvium derived from basalt. Slope is 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 3683 millimeters (145 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.)",
