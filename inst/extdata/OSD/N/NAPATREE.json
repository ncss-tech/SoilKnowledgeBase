  "OVERVIEW": "The Napatree series consists of very deep, subaqueous soils in submerged headlands, mainland coves, and submerged mainland beaches in lagoons, coves, and bays adjacent to glaciated uplands with numerous boulders and stones. The Napatree soils are formed in sandy marine deposits overlying submerged terrestrial loess or till deposits. These soils are permanently submerged beneath 10 through 200 cm of tidal estuarine water. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent, mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are permanently submerged except for some of the surface boulders that are exposed to the air during low tides. All horizons have a pH of neutral through moderately alkaline and an oxidized pH of ultra acid through neutral. Soil has a 5:1 salinity greater than 0.2 dS/m throughout the profile.\nThe Ase and ACse horizon, when present, has hue of neutral through 5GY, 5Y, or 10YR, value of 2.5 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is typically sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, or sandy loam with gravelly analogs. Thin horizons of fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam may be present. Consistence is nonfluid. Gravel content is 0 through 10 percent. Shell fragment content is 0 through 10 percent. Redoximorphic features may be present.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10Y, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4. Textures are similar to Ase and ACse horizons. Consistence is nonfluid. Gravel content is 0 through 20 percent.\nThe 2Cg and 3Cg horizons and 2C and 3C horizons, when present, have hue of 10YR, 10Y, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 6. They are typically silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand including gravelly or very gravelly analogs. Consistence is nonfluid. Gravel content is 0 through 40 percent. Redoximorphic features may be present."

The surface boulders are often exposed to the air at low tides. Slope ranges from 0 through 2 percent. The soils formed in submerged terrestrial soils with a capping of sandy marine deposits and can be found up to 5 meters deep under water. The potential for submarine fresh ground water discharge zones are high given the geomorphic position and high through very high saturated hydraulic conductivity."

The Anguilla soils are adjacent to landscapes dominated by outwash material in mainland coves and mainland submerged beaches, and have a particle-size class family of sandy and sulfidic materials in the soil profile. Fort Neck (T) soils have fluid, sulfidic materials at the soil surface. Billington, Wequetequock, and Pishagqua soils are in mainland coves and lagoon bottom landscapes and have fluid, sulfidic materials in the soil profile."

In addition fishing is commonplace and the species found in the area are smelt, small cod, flounder, scup, menhaden, and white perch. Some areas are vegetated with native floating algae and rooted vegetation such as eelgrass (Zostera marina). Vegetative cover ranges from 0 through 15 percent."
