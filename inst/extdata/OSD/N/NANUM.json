These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to the irrigation-induced water table and aquic conditions is 20 to 30 [r1]inches. The mollic epipedon is 30 to 60 inches thick. The upper 20 to 40 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.40 grams per cubic centimeter, volcanic glass of 5 to 20 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate iron of 0.20 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 15 to 20 percent for air dried samples. Base saturation throughout the upper 30 inches is greater than 75 percent. The particle-size control section has 27 to 35 percent clay by field texture and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It has a weighted average of 15 to 33 percent rock fragments by volume. Depth to a very gravelly 2Bw horizon is 20 to 40 inches. Organic matter is estimated to be 2 to 5 percent in the Ap and A horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist. Texture is ashy loam or ashy sandy clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist. Texture is ashy clay loam, ashy loam or ashy sandy clay loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. Texture is ashy clay loam, ashy sandy clay loam or ashy sandy clay.

Nitcha soils are dry to 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice and do not have aquic conditions within 12 to 30 inches.  Similar soils with isotic mineralogy are the Louella and Nitzel (T) soils.  Louella soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days and lack aquic conditions within 12 to 30 inches.  Nitzel soils are dry for 90 to 100 consecutive days and have a 2Bg horizon at a depth of 40 to 60 inches with redox concentrations."

Elevations are 1,400 to 2,500 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F., and the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."
