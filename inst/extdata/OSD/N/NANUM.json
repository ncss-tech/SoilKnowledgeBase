  "OVERVIEW": "The Nanum series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Nanum soils are on alluvial fans and terraces. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Depth to the irrigation-induced water table and aquic conditions is 20 to 30 [r1]inches. The mollic epipedon is 30 to 60 inches thick. The upper 20 to 40 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.40 grams per cubic centimeter, volcanic glass of 5 to 20 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate iron of 0.20 to 0.7 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 15 to 20 percent for air dried samples. Base saturation throughout the upper 30 inches is greater than 75 percent. The particle-size control section has 27 to 35 percent clay by field texture and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It has a weighted average of 15 to 33 percent rock fragments by volume. Depth to a very gravelly 2Bw horizon is 20 to 40 inches. Organic matter is estimated to be 2 to 5 percent in the Ap and A horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist.
