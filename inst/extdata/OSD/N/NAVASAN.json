  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  A perched water table is at a depth of about 60 inches throughtout most of the year.  Combined thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Siliceous and ironstone pebbles mainly less than 1/2 inch in diameter typically range from none to few.  Some subhorizons have thin discontinuous strata or clusters of pebbles.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  A few brownish mottles are in some pedons.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Most pedons contain few to common brownish or yellowish mottles in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe B/E or E/B horizon consists of loamy subsoil with streaks and spots of sandy E soil material or sandy E material with spots of loamy B soil material.  The B material has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.   Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or loam.   The E portion has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow or gray range from few to common.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Btg horizons have grayish matrix colors with few to many mottles.  High chroma colors are in hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Low chroma colors are in hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have a mottled matrix of these colors.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The reaction is strongly acid or medium acid.\nSome pedons have a loamy BC horizon below a depth of 60 inches. These horizons are in shades of brown or yellow with or without brownish or grayish mottles.  The reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These soils include Catilla, Desan, Matilo, Padina and Patilo of the same family.  Catilla soils are on uplands and do not have a water table within 60 inches of the surface.  Desan soils do not have wetness mottles in the Bt horizon.  Matilo, Padina and Patilo soils do not have a  water table within 60 inches of the surface.  In addition Matilo soils have a paralithic contact of sandstone at a depth of 60 to 80 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Navasan soils are on first level terraces within or adjacent to flood plains.  They are about 3 to 10 feet above the flood plain.  The soil formed in sandy alluvium of late Pleistocene or Recent Age.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent, with plane or convex surfaces.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 68 degrees F, and average annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 40 inches.  Frost free days range from 270 to 280, and the elevation ranges from 205 to 250 feet above sea level.  The Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 54 to 64."

Desan and Padina soils are above on higher terrace or upland positions.  The Dutek and Robco soils have surface layers less than 40 inches thick and are on higher terrace or upland positions.  The Gladewater and Kaufman soils are clayey throughout, and the Sandow soils are loamy throughout. These soils are on adjacent flood plains."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff.  This soil has rapid permeability in the upper part and moderately slow permeability in the lower part of the solum.  A water table is present at a depth of 4 to 6 feet for a cumulative annual duration of 1 to 4 months during most of the year.  Flooding ranges from none to rare for brief to very long periods."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for improved pasture and for rangeland.   Native vegetation is a post oak and yaupon savannah with an understory of tall and midgrasses.  Overgrazing causes brush species to invade and increase changing the savannah to thick brush with little understory in some areas.  Pastures consist mainly of improved bermudagrass."
