  "OVERVIEW": "The Navasan series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on first level terraces of streams and rivers.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in sandy alluvial sediments of late Pleistocene or Recent Age.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Combined thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Siliceous and ironstone pebbles mainly less than 1/2 inch in diameter typically range from none to few.  Some subhorizons have thin discontinuous strata or clusters of pebbles.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  A few brownish mottles are in some pedons.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Most pedons contain few to common brownish or yellowish mottles in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe B/E or E/B horizon consists of loamy subsoil with streaks and spots of sandy E soil material or sandy E material with spots of loamy B soil material.  The B material has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.   Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or loam.   The E portion has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow or gray range from few to common.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Btg horizons have grayish matrix colors with few to many mottles.  High chroma colors are in hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Low chroma colors are in hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have a mottled matrix of these colors.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The reaction is strongly acid or medium acid.\nSome pedons have a loamy BC horizon below a depth of 60 inches. These horizons are in shades of brown or yellow with or without brownish or grayish mottles.  The reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for improved pasture and for rangeland.   Native vegetation is a post oak and yaupon savannah with an understory of tall and midgrasses.  Overgrazing causes brush species to invade and increase changing the savannah to thick brush with little understory in some areas.  Pastures consist mainly of improved bermudagrass."
