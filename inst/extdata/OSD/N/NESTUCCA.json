  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is saturated and has a temporary water table during the winter unless they have been artificially drained.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 14 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Bw or Bg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Moist chroma of 1 is below 30 inches.  It has distinct or prominent redox concentrations.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 25 to 35 percent clay.  The lower part of the B horizon ranges to clay loam or silty clay in some pedons. Thin lenses of coarser material are in some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5B, value of 2.5 to 5 moist, 3 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to neutral moist and dry.  It ranges in texture from medium to fine and is stratified in some pedons.  It is silty clay, clay loam, or loam. It has distinct or prominent redox concentrations."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nestucca soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations range from 10 to 750 feet.  The soils formed in mixed recent alluvial. The soils are characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog. The average annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches.  The average January temperature is 42 degrees F., the average July temperature is 60 degrees F., the average annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 300 days.  This soil is on the Ingram geomorphic surface."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Knappa, Nehalem, Willanch, and the competing Brenner soils.  Knappa soils are well drained, lack redox concentrations and are on adjacent terraces.  Nehalem soils are well and moderately well drained and lack redox concentrations above a depth of 20 inches.  Nehalem, Brenner, and Willanch soils are on flood plains.  Knappa soils are on stream terraces."
