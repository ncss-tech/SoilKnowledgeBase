Unless the soil is irrigated, it has cracks more than 0.4 inch wide to a depth of 20 inches in most years.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 74 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Mottles range from few to common."

The soils formed in residuum weathered from basic igneous rocks that are relatively high in olivine phenochrysts.  The mean annual rainfall is 23 to 40 inches.  Average January temperature is about 71 degrees F., average July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F."
