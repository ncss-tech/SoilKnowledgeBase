  "OVERVIEW": "The Numana series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Numana soils are on flood plain steps and point bars of flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
