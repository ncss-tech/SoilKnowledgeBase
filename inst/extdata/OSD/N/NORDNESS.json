  "REVDATE": "10/2004",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nordness series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in loamy or silty material and a paleosol over limestone bedrock. These soils are on high structural benches, crests, and convex side slopes on uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters (33 inches).",
