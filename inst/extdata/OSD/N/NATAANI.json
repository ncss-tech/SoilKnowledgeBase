Nataani soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from Cretaceous siltstone and very fine grained sandstone.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,000 to 5,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

(A horizon)\nGypsic horizon - The zone from 9 to about 21 inches.  (2By1 and 2By2 horizons)\nParalithic contact - The presence of soft sedimentary bedrock at about 30 inches.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Ninth Edition, 2003\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The series type location was sampled for full characterization by the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) as pedon S86NM-045-006. Salinity values were also determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a wheatstone bridge.
