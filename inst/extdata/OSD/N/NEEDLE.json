  "OVERVIEW": "The Needle series consists of very shallow and shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian and alluvial deposits on hills, sand sheets on structural benches and plateaus. Slopes are 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
