  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches and is the same as depth to sandstone.  Some pedons have a thin loess mantle as much as 25 inches thick.  Volume of pebbles, mostly sandstone but with some chert, ranges from 0 to 20 percent throughout the pedon.  Volume of cobbles mainly in the lower part of the solum, ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The A horizon is strongly acid to neutral.  The B horizon is strongly acid to neutral in the upper part and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the lower part.  The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 23 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A horizon has 10YR hue, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry value is 6 or more.\nThe A or Ap horizon is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam.\nWhere present, the E horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe  Bt horizon has 7.5YR or 10YR  hue; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe  2Bt horizon has 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, 10GY, or 5G  hue; value of 3 through 8; and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam or clay loam.  In some pedons up to one-half of the upper Bt horizon formed in loess. Clay films in the Bt horizon are faint and patchy or discontinuous.  Loamy fine sand is also included if less than 6 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.  The underlying bedrock consists of fine-grained glauconitic sandstone.  Narrow joints containing residuum are common in the sandstone.  The sandstone can be dug with a spade, easily in some pedons, but with difficulty in others.  The sandstone becomes more cemented with depth."

All of the soils in the same family have no part of their control section formed in residuum weathered from glauconitic sandstone.  Arland and Hixton soils have contrasting textures above 40 inches.  Gale and La Farge soils formed in a thicker mantle of silty deposits and have less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine in the control section.  In addition, the Gale soils do not have glauconite in lower parts of their sola.  Urne soils formed in similar deposits, but are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Norden soils are on highly dissected upland underlain by glauconitic sandstone.  They typically are side slopes and ridgetops with slope gradients from 2 to 65 percent.  Norden soils formed in loess and the underlying loamy residuum weathered from the underlying fine-grained glauconitic sandstone (typically the Tunnel City sandstone that is identified, in part by it's high content of glauconitic minerals).   In some places, there is up to 25 inches of loess overlying the residuum.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 32 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F."

Hixton soils are associated on the nonglauconitic, coarser grained sandstone formation.  Urne soils have cambic rather than argillic horizons.  Greenridge soils have loess deposits greater than 25 inches."
