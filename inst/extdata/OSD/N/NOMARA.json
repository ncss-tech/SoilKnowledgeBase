    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nomara soils are on side slopes of mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from argillite, slate, andesite, quartzite, and limestone with some influence from loess.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,680 to 2,320 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."

Gosumi soils are 100 to 150 cm deep to bedrock, lack secondary carbonates within 107 cm, and have 35 to 50 percent clay in the particle-size  control section.  Sumine soils have a mollic epipedon that is 20 to 38 cm thick and are noneffervescent in their profiles."
