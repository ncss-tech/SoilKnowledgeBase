  "OVERVIEW": "The Norob series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed from mixed alluvium, with many areas having eolian deposits on the soil surface. Norob soils are on alluvial plains and alluvial flats in the Mojave Desert. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

These soils have had the silts and clays removed from the surface layers and often also have a windblown sand deposition on the soil surface. Where this occurs an abrupt boundary between the A and B horizons exists.\nClay: 2 to 7 percent in the sand, loamy sand or fine sands. 8 to 16 percent in the sandy loam, and 10 to 25 percent in the loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loams.\nCarbonates: Typically noneffervescent in the sand, loamy sand, and fine sand; very slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent in the sandy loam, loam and sandy clay loams.\nElectrical conductivity: 0 to 4 decisiemens per meter.\nSodium adsorption ratio: 5 to 13.\nCoarse fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravels.\nReaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.\nE horizon--Caps the columns of the Btn horizon. This band is 1/16 to 1 inch thick and has colors of 10YR 7/1, 7/2 dry. This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nBtn horizon--7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6 and 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/6 dry; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6 and 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6 moist.\nTexture: Sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nClay: 20 to 35 percent.\nCarbonates: Noneffervescent to strongly effervescent with carbonates disseminated and segregated as thin filaments, threads, seams or soft masses.\nElectrical conductivity: 4 to 16 decisiemens per meter.\nSodium adsorption ratio: 13 to 100.\nCoarse fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravels.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nBk horizon--7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6 and 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 dry; 7.5YR 4/4 and 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6 moist.\nTexture: Stratified gravelly loamy sandy to sandy clay loam.\nClay: 10 to 20 percent.\nElectrical conductivity: 0 to 4 decisiemens per meter.\nSodium adsorption ratio: 1 to 13.\nCoarse fragments: 2 to 30 percent gravels.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

Casaga are well drained, have appreciable summer soil moisture, and have 40 to 60 percent rock fragments in the substratum. Garces soils always have an E horizon that is 2 to 10 inches thick, and are well drained. Gothard soils have appreciable summer soil moisture, and always have an E horizon that is 2 to 7 inches thick. Leuhman soils typically have 2.5Y and 5Y colors in the profile, and have electrical conductivities of 16 to 32 decisiemens per meter and sodium adsorption ratios of 13 to 50 in the substratum. Polvadero soils are well drained and have calcic horizons."
