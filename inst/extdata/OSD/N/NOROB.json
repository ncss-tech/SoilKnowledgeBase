  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nMean annual soil temperature: 62 to 66 degrees F.\nSoil moisture: Unless irrigated, the soil is usually dry in all parts between depths of 7 and 20 inches more than 1/2 of the time in most years.\nA Horizon--7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4 and 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 dry; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4 and 10YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4 moist.\nTexture: Sand, loamy sand or fine sand where deposited by wind; otherwise sandy loam in the upper part, and loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam in the lower part. These soils have had the silts and clays removed from the surface layers and often also have a windblown sand deposition on the soil surface. Where this occurs an abrupt boundary between the A and B horizons exists.\nClay: 2 to 7 percent in the sand, loamy sand or fine sands. 8 to 16 percent in the sandy loam, and 10 to 25 percent in the loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loams.\nCarbonates: Typically noneffervescent in the sand, loamy sand, and fine sand; very slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent in the sandy loam, loam and sandy clay loams.\nElectrical conductivity: 0 to 4 decisiemens per meter.\nSodium adsorption ratio: 5 to 13.\nCoarse fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravels.\nReaction: Neutral to moderately alkaline.\nE horizon--Caps the columns of the Btn horizon. This band is 1/16 to 1 inch thick and has colors of 10YR 7/1, 7/2 dry. This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nBtn horizon--7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6 and 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/6 dry; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6 and 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6 moist.\nTexture: Sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nClay: 20 to 35 percent.\nCarbonates: Noneffervescent to strongly effervescent with carbonates disseminated and segregated as thin filaments, threads, seams or soft masses.\nElectrical conductivity: 4 to 16 decisiemens per meter.\nSodium adsorption ratio: 13 to 100.\nCoarse fragments: 0 to 10 percent gravels.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nBk horizon--7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6 and 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 dry; 7.5YR 4/4 and 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6 moist.\nTexture: Stratified gravelly loamy sandy to sandy clay loam.\nClay: 10 to 20 percent.\nElectrical conductivity: 0 to 4 decisiemens per meter.\nSodium adsorption ratio: 1 to 13.\nCoarse fragments: 2 to 30 percent gravels.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Casaga, Garces, Gothard, Leuhman, and Polvadero series. Casaga are well drained, have appreciable summer soil moisture, and have 40 to 60 percent rock fragments in the substratum. Garces soils always have an E horizon that is 2 to 10 inches thick, and are well drained. Gothard soils have appreciable summer soil moisture, and always have an E horizon that is 2 to 7 inches thick. Leuhman soils typically have 2.5Y and 5Y colors in the profile, and have electrical conductivities of 16 to 32 decisiemens per meter and sodium adsorption ratios of 13 to 50 in the substratum. Polvadero soils are well drained and have calcic horizons."

The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches. The average January temperature is 44 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 87 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F. The frost free season is 200 to 250 days."
