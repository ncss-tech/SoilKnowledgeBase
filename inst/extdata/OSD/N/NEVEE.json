  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock typically ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to free carbonates is less than 10 inches.  The control section is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam averaging between 10 and 18 percent clay.  Some pedons have up to 35 percent coarse fragments greater than 3 inches in the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Where the color value is as dark or darker than 5.5 and 3.5 moist, the horizon has chroma of 4 or more or is too thin for a mollic epipedon.  It is typically silt loam, but some pedons are loam or very fine sandy loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.  It has colors an textures of the A horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam, but some pedons are silty clay loam in the lower part.  It typically has few to many, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate in the upper part.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is reddish colored silty shale, siltstone, or sandstone and is below depths of 40 inches.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline."

Keota soils have yellower hue and have siltstone between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Mitchell soils have yellower hue throughout.  Barnum soils have a fine-loamy control section and are more stratified.  Colby soils have a fine-silty control section.  Gypnevee soils have a gypsic horizon.  Neville soils are fine-loamy.  Sully soils are more moist and have 10YR or 2.5Y hue throughout the control section.  Tilford and Vale soils have a mollic epipedon.  In addition, the Vale soils have an argillic horizon."

Surfaces are dominantly smooth plane, and slope gradients range from 1 to 30 percent.  The Nevee soils formed in silty alluvium weathered from reddish colored silty shale, siltstone, or sandstone.  Mean annual air temperature is 43 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches."
