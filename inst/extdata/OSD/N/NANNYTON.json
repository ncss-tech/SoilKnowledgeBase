  "OVERVIEW": "The Nannyton series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderte permeability formed in alluvium dominantly from rhyolite, granite and basalt.  They are on in valleys.  Average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",
