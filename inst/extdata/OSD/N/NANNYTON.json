    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nannyton soils are on level to moderately sloping alluvial fans and terraces at elevations of 2,300 to 2,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The soils formed in alluvium dominantly from rhyolitic, granitic, and basaltic sources. The climate is arid with very dry summers. Average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches, including a little snowfall.  Average annual temperature is 53 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 145 to 160 days."
