    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the Calcic horizon is 13 to 26 inches.  A lithic contact is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and is 10 to 35 percent rock fragments including indurated durinodes.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  It is silt loam or gravelly silt loam.\nThe 2Bqk horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam or gravelly loam.  The coarse fragments include 20 to 50 percent lime-silica  indurated durinodes and lime-silica coated basalt fragments."

Elevations range from 1,200 to 2,700 feet.  Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 135 to 155 days."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are mollic epipedon from the surface to 19 inches, a calcic horizon from 19 to 35 inches, and a lithic contact at 35 inches.  Soil Taxonomy does not recognize durinodes in Typic Haploxerolls, nor Calcic Haploxerolls.  This soil would be in a duric subgroup if such were provided in Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
