  "OVERVIEW": "The North Beach series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very rapid over moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in wave-worked beach deposits derived mainly from sandstone, limestone, and quartzite. These soils are on lake beaches and lake terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Average annual precipitation is 14 inches, and average annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",
