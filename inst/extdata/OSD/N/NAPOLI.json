  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 75 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to the top of the fragipan horizon is 12 to 27 inches. Rock fragments, dominantly channers and flagstones, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the surface layer, from 10 to 45 percent in the upper part of the subsoil, from 15 to 45 percent in the lower part of the subsoil, and from 20 to 60 percent in the substratum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction commonly ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid. Thickness of the A horizons ranges from 2 to 5 inches.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4 with distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid. Some pedons have a Bg horizon with chroma of 2.\nThe Eg or E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or platy. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is prismatic and/or blocky. Some horizons have weak platy structure. Consistence is firm or very firm, and is brittle or slightly brittle. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that has color similar to the Btx horizon and texture similar to the C horizon. Structure is prismatic or platy, or the material is massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam. Some subhorizons are silty clay. The material is massive or has plate like divisions. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral but the range includes slightly alkaline in the C horizon in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Shongo series are in the same family. Shongo soils are formed in colluvium and residual material. They do not contain granite glacial erratics.\nSimilar series in related families are the Abbottstown, Almond, Burdett, Cambridge, Darien, Erie, Gresham, Gretor, Ontusia, Ravenna, Volusia and Venango series. Abbottstown, Gresham, Ravenna, and Venango soils have a mesic temperature regime. Almond, Burdett, and Darien soils lack fragipan horizons. Cambridge soils lack redoximorphic features in the upper part of the subsoil. Erie, Ontusia and Volusia soils lack argillic horizons. Gretor soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Napoli soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils on upland hilltops, lower valley sides and toeslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The soils formed in Illinoian or early Wisconsin age till derived from siltstone, shale, granite, and fine-grained sandstone. These soils are near the glaciated-unglaciated border. Mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and the mean annual frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. These soils are at elevations from 1750 feet to 2400 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Napoli soils are the somewhat poorly drained member of a drainage sequence that includes the moderately well drained Yorkshire soils. The Almond, Darien, Erie, Fremont, Gretor, Ischua, Steamburg, and Volusia soils are on nearby landscapes. Almond and Steamburg soils are in areas that lack a fragipan horizon. Ischua and Gretor soils occur where bedrock is at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Competing Darien, Erie and Volusia soils, and Fremont soils occur at lower elevations, and in addition Fremont soils lack fragipan horizons."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Napoli soils were cleared at one time and used for growing hay and pasture with some corn and small grains. Because of the relatively short growing season many areas are reverting to woodland. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods of sugar maple, white ash, black cherry, beech, hemlock and eastern white pine."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The occurrence of Napoli soils is near the outer glacial margin with residual soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n(1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 9 inches\n(Ap horizon).\n(2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 23 to 46 inches (Btx horizons).\n(3) Fragipan - the zone from 23 to 46 inches (Btx horizons).\n(4) Aqualfs suborder - aquic moisture conditions, and evidence of wetness that includes 2 chroma ped face colors and redoximorphic features in the zone from 23 to 46 inches (Btx horizons), and redoximorphic features immediately below the Ap horizon (Bw horizon).\n(5) Aeric subgroup - as evidenced by the dominant high chroma (>2) zone at a depth of 9 to 15 inches (Bw horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
