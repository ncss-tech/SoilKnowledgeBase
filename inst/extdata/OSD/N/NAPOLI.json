  "OVERVIEW": "The Napoli series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till derived from siltstone, shale and sandstone. A dense fragipan is present starting at depths of 12 to 27 inches. These soils are on glaciated uplands at elevations above 1800 feet. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Structure is prismatic or platy, or the material is massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam. Some subhorizons are silty clay. The material is massive or has plate like divisions.

They do not contain granite glacial erratics.\nSimilar series in related families are the Abbottstown, Almond, Burdett, Cambridge, Darien, Erie, Gresham, Gretor, Ontusia, Ravenna, Volusia and Venango series. Abbottstown, Gresham, Ravenna, and Venango soils have a mesic temperature regime. Almond, Burdett, and Darien soils lack fragipan horizons. Cambridge soils lack redoximorphic features in the upper part of the subsoil. Erie, Ontusia and Volusia soils lack argillic horizons. Gretor soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

The soils formed in Illinoian or early Wisconsin age till derived from siltstone, shale, granite, and fine-grained sandstone. These soils are near the glaciated-unglaciated border. Mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and the mean annual frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. These soils are at elevations from 1750 feet to 2400 feet above sea level."

The Almond, Darien, Erie, Fremont, Gretor, Ischua, Steamburg, and Volusia soils are on nearby landscapes. Almond and Steamburg soils are in areas that lack a fragipan horizon. Ischua and Gretor soils occur where bedrock is at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Competing Darien, Erie and Volusia soils, and Fremont soils occur at lower elevations, and in addition Fremont soils lack fragipan horizons."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Napoli soils were cleared at one time and used for growing hay and pasture with some corn and small grains. Because of the relatively short growing season many areas are reverting to woodland. Native vegetation is mixed hardwoods of sugar maple, white ash, black cherry, beech, hemlock and eastern white pine."
