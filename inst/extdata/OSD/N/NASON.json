Rock fragments of quartz and schist range from 0 to 35 percent in the A, Ap, E, and Bt horizons, and 15 to 40 percent in the BC and C horizons. The solum is very strongly acid or strongly acid unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam and eroded areas may be silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Value of 2 or 3 is limited to horizons less than 6 inches thick.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam, and eroded areas include silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow may occur.  Texture is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, and clay loam in the fine-earth fraction with from 35 to 55 percent clay and more than 30 percent silt, or more than 40 percent silt plus very fine sand.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8, and is usually mottled.  The fine-earth fraction of the BC horizon is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon is multicolored in shades of brown, red, yellow, gray, or white.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam saprolite in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, slightly fractured to highly fractured serecite schist that can be dug with difficulty with a spade.
