  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 50 to 100 cm. Rock fragments, mostly gravel and cobbles, range from 5 to 25 percent in the upper part of the mineral solum and from 20 to 45 percent in the BC horizon and in the C horizon, where present.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is commonly fine sandy loam and less commonly loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe BC horizon has commonly has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky, or it is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 3. It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Pyrities is the only series in the same family. Pyrities soils are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock.\nConic and Linneus soils are in related families. Conic soils have lower base status and formed in dense till from igneous rocks. The Conic soils are also in areas with lower precipitation. Linneus soils are restricted to silt loam texture."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nehasne soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils over sandstone, dolomite, limestone or marble bedrock. They formed in till. Slopes are commonly 0 to 15 percent, but range to 35 percent. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 863 to 1270 mm. The growing season (frost-free) ranges from 90 to 150 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kalurah, Insula, Malone, Matoon, Ogdensburg, Summerville, Pyrities, and Ruse soils. The Kalurah, Pyrities, and Malone soils are deep soils on nearby landscapes where the topography is not influenced as much by closely underlying bedrock. In addition, Malone soils have an aquic moisture regime. Matoon soils are fine-textured and are on nearby landscapes of lacustrine or marine derivation. Insula soils are 25 to 50 cm deep to bedrock. Ogdensburg and Ruse soils have aquic moisture regimes. In addition, Ruse soils are 25 to 50 cm deep to bedrock."

In areas that have folded metamorphic rock, these soils are either in hayland, pasture, or are forested. Tree species include sugar maple, basswood, white ash northern red oak and hemlock."

Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 58 cm (Bw horizons).\n3. Dystric Eutrochrept feature - data have been collected on similar soils that indicate that neutral reactions are indicative of base saturations in excess of 60 percent saturation. There are no free carbonates within one meter, however (Dystric feature).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
