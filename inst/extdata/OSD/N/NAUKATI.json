  "OVERVIEW": "The Naukati series consists of shallow, moderately well and well drained soils formed in residuum from red sedimentary rock and underlain by bedrock at less than 20 inches.  These soils occur on gently sloping to sloping lowland rolling hills.  The mean annual precipitation is in excess of 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. Slopes range from 5 to 10 percent.",

The Kaikli series are forested, poorly drained organic soils which occur on flat to gently sloping lowlands.  The Kina soils are very deep, very poorly drained organic soils which are mostly non-forested.  The Kogish soils are non-forested, very poorly drained organic soils derived mainly from sphagnum mosses.  The Maybeso series are forested, poorly drained organic soils which developed over glacial till.  The Staney series are very poorly drained sedge soils which occur along streams and rivers."

Field data does not support thixotropic.  The particle size of the control section has a significant relation to the physical and chemical properties of the soil."
