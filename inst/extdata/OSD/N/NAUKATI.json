Coarse fragment content in the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 80 percent and is dominantly gravel.  Reaction is moderately acid to extremely acid.\nThe E horizon has a hue from 10R through 10YR, value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 4.  The coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The E horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value moist of 3 or 4, and chroma moist of 2 to 4.  The coarse fragment content ranges from 15 to 80 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value moist of 3 or 4, and chroma moist from 2 to 6.

The climate is humid maritime with a mean annual precipitation in excess of 100 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F and the mean summer air temperature is about 55 degrees F.  Dominant slope gradients range from 5 to 10 percent.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 100 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Kaikli, Kina, Kogish, Maybeso and Staney series.  The Kaikli series are forested, poorly drained organic soils which occur on flat to gently sloping lowlands.  The Kina soils are very deep, very poorly drained organic soils which are mostly non-forested.  The Kogish soils are non-forested, very poorly drained organic soils derived mainly from sphagnum mosses.  The Maybeso series are forested, poorly drained organic soils which developed over glacial till.  The Staney series are very poorly drained sedge soils which occur along streams and rivers."

Overstory vegetation includes western hemlock and Sitka spruce with smaller amounts of Alaska yellow-cedar and western redcedar.  The understory is dominantly blue berry, rusty menziesia, bunchberry dogwood, five-leaf bramble, ferns and mosses."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil include: a spodic horizon from 2 ot 5 inches; assumed organic carbon content greater than 6 percent in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon; loamy-skeletal material within the particle size control section; a lithic contact at less than 20 inches; a cryic temperature regime.\nThe Naukati series was formerly classified as thixotropic-skeletal.  Field data does not support thixotropic.  The particle size of the control section has a significant relation to the physical and chemical properties of the soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
