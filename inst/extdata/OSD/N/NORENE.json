  "OVERVIEW": "The Norene series consists of deep, poorly drained or somewhat poorly drained soils on nearly level stream terraces and on broad flats and in slight depressions at heads of drainageways.  These soils formed in alluvium that is silty in the upper part and typically becomes more clayey with depth.  Slopes are normally less than 1 percent, but range from 0 to 2 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  Coarse fragments make up less than 5 percent of the soil.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Mottles are none to common in shades of brown or gray.  It silt loam or silty clay loam.\nMost pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and Bt horizons.  In pedons without a transitional horizon, the upper part of the Bt horizon must meet the color requirements of an Aeric Orchraqualfs.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral.  Mottles are in shades of brown, red, and gray.  In addition to these colors, some pedons have coatings on peds with a chroma of 2 or less and a matrix of higher chroma with mottles of chroma 2 or less.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC and Cg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 or is neutral.  Mottles are in shades of brown or gray and some pedons may be mottled without a dominant matrix color.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay."

Acy soils have calcium carbonate concretions in the B horizon.  Dundee soils formed is stratified loamy sediments and have a higher sand content.  Essen, Glavez and Patoutville soils are moderately alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon.  Frozard soils are neutral to strongly alkaline in the Bt horizon and have 5 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the upper 16 inches of the Bt.  Hebert and McGehee soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the B horizon.  Idee soils have sola thicker than 60 inches and have a 2Bt horizon."
