    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. under canopy cover.  The soil is usually moist and is dry in all parts between the depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the four month period following the summer solstice. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The umbric epipedon is more than 20 inches thick. The particle-size control section has less than 35 percent rock fragments.  It has an estimated phosphate-retention of 95 to 100 percent, Alox +  Feox of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, and 15-bar moisture (dried) of 20 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and dry, chroma 1 to 3 moist and dry. It is medial silt loam, medial loam, or medial silty clay loam and has 10 to 15 percent organic matter.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent paragravel and 15 to 30 percent clay by field estimate.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry. Dark colored stains and coatings are common in channels and pores in some pedons. It is medial silt loam, medial loam, medial silty clay loam, or medial clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay by field estimate.  It has 0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent paragravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Neskowin soils are on coasal hills, mountains, and headlands adjacent to the Pacific Ocean at elevations of 50 to 1,800 feet. Slopes are 5 to 100 percent. They formed in moderately fine textured colluvium weathered from basic igneous rocks. The climate is cool and humid. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 110 inches. The mean January temperature is 42 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 61 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fendall, Necanicum, Reedsport, Templeton, Tolovana, and the competing Klootchie and Neotsu soils. Fendall and Reedsport soils are over a paralithic contact. In addition, Fendall soils have a fine particle-size family class and Reedsport soils have a fine-loamy family class.  Necanicum soils are deeper than 40 inches to basalt bedrock and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the texture control section. Templeton soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock and have a fine-silty particle-size family class. Tolovana soils are medial over loamy in the particle-size control section and are more than 60 inches deep to bedrock. All of these soils are on summits and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains."
