The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F. and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 35 to 45 degrees F.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F. from about December 1 to March 1 and is below 41 degrees F. from about January 1 to February 1 in most years.  The soil between the depths of 10 and 18 inches is dry throughout for 230 to 260 days from about April 1 to December 15.  It is moist throughout for 30 to 50 days from about January 15 to March 1 and is moist in some or all parts for 25 to 35 consecutive days from about March 1 to April 1, when the soil temperature exceeds 47 degrees F.

Anway soils have a solum less than 20 inches thick.  Avenal soils have a difference of 35 degrees F. or less between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures.  Berino, Cornville, Hap, Madurez, Mohave and Tres Hermanos soils have a calcic horizon.  Bucklebar, Bryman, and Mirage soils have hues of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt horizon.  Dutchflat and Lanip soils are moist within the soil moisture control section for up to 20 days between July and September. Milham soils are calcareous throughout.  Also, they have less than 35 degrees F. difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures and the number of days the soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. is 300 to 325 days.  Garlock and Palomas soils are noncalcareous in the Bt or BCt horizons.  Hi Vista soils are underlain by a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
