  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is greater than 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is 6 feet or more. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid except the surface layer is less acid where limed. Rock fragments range from 15 to about 35 percent in each horizon. The fragments are mostly sandstone and range from 0.25 inch to about 20 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6 except severely eroded areas also have hue of 5YR and chroma of 8. The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. The fine earth fraction of the A and E horizons are loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or rarely silt loam. Severely eroded areas are also sandy clay loam or clay loam in some pedons.\nMany pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 6 or 8. In some pedons, the Bt horizon also has hue of 7.5YR in the upper part and value of 3 in the lower part. Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow and red. The fine earth fraction is clay loam or sandy clay loam except the upper part ranges to loam and the lower part ranges to clay or sandy clay in some pedons. In the particle size control section, clay content averages between 25 and 35 percent, sand content between 20 and 55 percent and silt content is more than 20 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Soils in the same family are the Allen, Dubach, Etowah, Holston, Ruston, Sailes, Silsbee, and Warnock series. Soils in closely related families are the Addielou, Avilla, Bama, Ironcity, Leesburg, Lytle, Minvale, Noboco, Octavia, and Pikeville series.  Allen soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the B horizon. Dubach soils formed in loamy sediments on Coastal Plain stream terraces. Etowah soils have A horizons with value of 3 and less than 15 percent fragments. Holston, Noboco, and Leesburg soils have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Ruston soils are bisequel. Sailes soils formed in loamy marine sediments on the Coastal Plain on broad interstream divides. Silsbee soils formed in loamy sediments of early to mid Pleistocene age. Warnock soils contain less than 15 percent fragments and the lower part of the Bt horizon has gray mottles is brittle in some pedons. Addielou soils have an A horizon more than 20 inches thick. Avilla and Pikeville soils have up to 70 fragments in the lower part. Bama soils are free of rock fragments. Ironcity and Octavia soils have clayey 2Bt horizons. Leesburg and Minvale soils have sandstone or chert gravels in the Bt horizon. Lytle soils formed from loess-mantled coastal plain sediments. Noboco soils have redox depletions and accumulations associated with seasonal wetness within 30 to 48 inches of the surface."

These soils formed in loamy alluvium or colluvium and in residuum of limestone, sandstone and shale. Mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 54 inches near the type location."
