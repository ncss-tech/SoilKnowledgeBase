    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is 30  to 60 inches.   These soils typically have 2 to 15 percent pebble size rock fragments throughout and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.   Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to slighlty acid.\nMost pedons have either B/E or E/B horizons with properties of the E and B horizons respectively.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. The clay content ranges from 18 to 27 percent and sand content ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  The Bt horizon has few to common Fe depletions of 2 chroma or less within 10 inches of the upper boundary of the Bt horizon.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon that is similar to the C horizon but has evidence of appreciable accumulation of secondary carbonates.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 5.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.   The clay content ranges from 5 to 18 percent and the sand content ranges from 45 to 70 percent.  Reaction is slightly  alkaline or moderately alkaline."
