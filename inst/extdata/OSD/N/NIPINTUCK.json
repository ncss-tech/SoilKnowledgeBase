    "content": "TYPICAL PEDON:  Nipintuck very gravelly coarse sandy loam -- on a west-facing convex slope of 6 percent, in native rangeland at 2,010 meter elevation.   About 90 percent of the surface is covered with 2 to 5 cm of fine gravel with occasional stone and cobble.  (When described on July 18, l978, the soil was dry throughout.  Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.)\nA--0 to 5 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 2 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)\nC--5 to 15 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)\nR--15 cm; fractured densely welded rhyolitic tuff."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nipintuck soils are on sideslopes and summits of foothills and mountains at elevations of 1,463 to 2,073 meters.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from welded rhyolitic tuff.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm and the average annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
