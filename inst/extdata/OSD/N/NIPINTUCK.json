  "OVERVIEW": "The Nipintuck series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from welded rhyolitic tuff.  Nipintuck soils are on foothills and mountains.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 300 mm, and average annual temperature is 6 degrees C.",

About 90 percent of the surface is covered with 2 to 5 cm of fine gravel with occasional stone and cobble.  (When described on July 18, l978, the soil was dry throughout.  Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.)\nA--0 to 5 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very gravelly coarse sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles, 2 percent stones; slightly acid (pH 6.5); clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 15 cm thick)\nC--5 to 15 cm; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) very cobbly loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/4) moist; massive; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few very fine and fine roots; few very fine and fine interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, 20 percent cobbles; slightly acid (pH 6.4); abrupt irregular boundary.  (5 to 10 cm thick)\nR--15 cm; fractured densely welded rhyolitic tuff."
