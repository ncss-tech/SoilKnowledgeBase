(Ap1 horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 48 to 87 centimeters (19 to 34 inches). (Bk1 horizon)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nLAN 3/2013 The previous classification of Ustic Haplocalcids became obsolete after a field project indicated that these soils had mollic epipedons.  Based on this project the type location was moved from Prowers County, Colorado to Otero County, Colorado and changes the Taxonomic class to Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Calciustolls.\nLast updated on 10/2013.\nModified format by LRM in 7/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nUpdated horizon suffix changing Ca to k.
