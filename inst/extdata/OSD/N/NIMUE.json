  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nimue soils are on rounded ridges and mountain side slopes at elevations of 3,100 to 5,500 feet. Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent, but are dominantly greater than 30 percent. These soils formed in a mantle of volcanic ash and pumice over residuum and colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks including basalt, andesite and flow breccia and from gneiss and schist. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 120 inches with most of it in the form of snow and rain during the winter months. The average January temperature is 27 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 58 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F. The growing season is 100 to 130 days at 28 degrees F."
