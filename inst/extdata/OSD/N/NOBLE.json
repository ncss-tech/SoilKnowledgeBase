  "OVERVIEW": "The Noble series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium from the Permian redbeds.  These nearly level to steep soils formed in footslopes of uplands in the Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A).  Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 864 mm (34 in).",
