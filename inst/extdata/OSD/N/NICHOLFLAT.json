  "OVERVIEW": "The Nicholflat series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Nicholflat soils are on alluvial flats with slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
