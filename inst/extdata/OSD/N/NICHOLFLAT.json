Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.)\nE--0 to 3 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; many very fine, common fine, and few medium roots; common very fine and fine vesicular pores; 5 percent gravel; slightly acid (pH 6.3); clear smooth boundary.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nicholflat soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial flats at elevations of 5,300 to 5,600 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches, and average annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
