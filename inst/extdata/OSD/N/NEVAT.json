  "OVERVIEW": "The Nevat series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed colluvium with a volcanic ash mantle.  Nevat soils are on mountain footslopes and have slopes of 2 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Nevat soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days between depths of 8 to 24 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  These soils are slightly acid or neutral throughout.  The control section at depths between l0 and 40 inches averages l5 to 30 percent rock fragments.  Hue is l0YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of l or 2 moist and dry.\nThe 2Ab horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry and is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bwb has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly fine sandy loam."

Elevations are 800 to l,800 feet.  The soils are in a marine type climate with mean annual precipitation of 50 to 70 inches occurring mostly as rain during the winter.  Mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is l25 to l75 days.
