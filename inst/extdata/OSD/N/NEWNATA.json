  "REVDATE": "10/2003",
  "STATES": "AR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Newnata series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from interbedded limestone, alkaline shale and siltstone.  These soils are on hillsides and ridges with slopes ranging from 3 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to hard bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A  and E horizons and from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the BA, B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, 4, or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Horizons with mollic colors are less than 7 inches in thickness.  Texture of the A horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or with stony or flaggy modifiers.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4.  Texture of the A horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or with stony or flaggy modifiers.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is silty clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, or with flaggy modifiers.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4, or value of 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown or red.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Flaggy phases are recognized.\nThe BC and C horizon, where present, have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown, red, or gray.  Texture is the same as for the Bt horizon.  Some C horizons are equally variegated in shades of brown and gray.  Calcium carbonate concretions are none to few.\nThe Cr horizon is partly weathered interbedded limestone, alkaline shale, and siltstone.  Vertical fractures and some pedons do not have a Cr horizon.  Seams of 0.25 to 0.5 inches in width are commonly silty clay or clay.\nThe underlying R horizon is hard, gray limestone bedrock"
