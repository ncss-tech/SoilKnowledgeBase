  "OVERVIEW": "The Nosavvy series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium from volcanic rocks. Nosavvy soils are on plateaus and escartments. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",
