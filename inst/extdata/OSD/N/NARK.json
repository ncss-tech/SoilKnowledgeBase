  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 10 to 19 inches thick and the depth to the indurated duripan is 24 to 38 inches. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick. These soils are usually dry, mainly during the summer and autumn. The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F. The A1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. When the surface 7 inches are mixed, value is less than 5.5 dry. It has weak or moderate very fine granular structure, or it is massive. This horizon is soft or slightly hard. The Bt1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is dominantly clay loam but subhorizons of some pedons are gravelly loam. This horizon averages 27 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent pebbles. It has moderate or strong angular blocky or weak prismatic structure. The Bqk2 horizon immediately above the indurated duripan has 3 to 6 inches of strongly cemented material in some pedons. The duripan (Bqkm horizon) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nark soils are on smooth or slightly convex, nearly level to moderately sloping old alluvial fan piedmonts at elevations of 6,300 to 7,000 feet. Slope gradients are O to 8 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium mainly from sedimentary rock sources and include limestone and shale. The climate is cool, continental with an average precipitation of 10 to 12 inches. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The OSED was scanned by NSSQA in 1987.  Content was last revised by the state on 1/74.\nNark soils were originally classified as Calcisols.\nThe taxonomic classification was changed in 1990 from Fine, montmorillonitic, frigid Xerollic Durargids to Fine-loamy, mixed, frigid Aridic Durixerolls.\nThe series was inactivated in 4/2001 as it was never formally correlated in the soil survey of Western White Pine County Area, Nevada.  The type location was mapped over with other soil series that have similar use and management.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
