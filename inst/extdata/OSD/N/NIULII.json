  "OVERVIEW": "The Niulii series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  Niulii soils are on ash fields and have slopes of 6 to 100 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 2286 millimeters (90 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 21 degress C. (70 degrees F.)",
