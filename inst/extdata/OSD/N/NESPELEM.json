  "OVERVIEW": "The Nespelem series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with a mantle of loess. These soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between a depth of 8 and 24 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to a weakly cemented duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to soft powdery lime accumulations ranges from 16 to 36 inches. The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand or coarser by weighted average.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR dry or moist; value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR dry or moist; value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It crushes to silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist; and chroma of 1 through 4 dry or moist. It is stratified (varved) silt loam, very fine sandy loam, and silty clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or strongly alkaline."

The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. Average annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 15 inches. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F; and the mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free season is 110 to 170 days."

In addition, Conconully, Disautel, and Owhi soils are coarse-loamy. Emdent soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a sodium adsorption ratio greater than 13 in the upper 20 inches. Ewall soils are sandy. Haley soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."
