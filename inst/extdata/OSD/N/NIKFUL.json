Mottles range from few to common in shades of gray, red, and brown.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is from medium acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are few to common in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  Texture is clay or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to extremely acid.\n2B/C horizon has colors and textures similar to the Bt horizon.  Fifty to seventy-five percent of the horizon is composed of B material stratified with layers of weakly consolidated tuffaceous siltstone or sandstone.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 or 3, and is weakly consolidated tuffaceous siltstone of sandstone that is bentonitic and contains volcanic ash, volcanic glass, and other pyroclastic materials."

Other competing series are the Arriola, Bolling, Browndell, Elmina, Falba, Goreen, Invershiel, Keltys, Midland, Orange, Pender, Rosenwall, Spruger, and Tupelo series.  Arriola and Spurger soils have abrupt boundaries to the argillic horizon and have mixed mineralogy.  Bolling, Keltys, and Pender soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Browndell soils are less than 20 inches over soft bedrock.  Elmina soils have loamy fine sand surface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  Falba and Midland soils are dominated by gray throughout the solum; in addition, Falba soils have an abrupt textural change to the argillic horizon.  Goreen and Rosenwall soils have base saturation less than 35 percent.  Invershiel and Orange soils have an abrupt textural change to the argillic horizon.  Tupelo soils have mixed mineralogy, are less acid in the lower B horizon, and are underlain by hard limestone."
