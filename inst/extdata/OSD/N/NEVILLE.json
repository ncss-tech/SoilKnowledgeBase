  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 79 degrees F.  These soils are typically calcareous but some pedons are leached to a maximum depth of 10 inches. Gypsum on a weighted average basis is less than 5 percent in the control section and in most subhorizons above 24 inches is less than 3 percent.  Exchangeable sodium is less than 15 percent and conductivity is less than 15 millimhos in subhorizons totalling 6 or more inches above a depth of 24 inches.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 5 percent in the upper 20 inches and does not exceed 8 percent in the lower parts of the control section.  Continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate occur below 40 inches, but some visible accumulations may occur at any depth in some pedons.  The particle size control section is loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam and less commonly sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 20 to 50 percent, and sand from 20 to 60 percent.  Sand coarser than very fine sand ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in much of the control section and are mainly less than 10 inches in diameter.  The soil is moist cumulative in some part when the temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  for 56 to 152 days, which occurs mainly in April through June.  Soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. for 230 to 305 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR and redder, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 5YR or redder, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  This horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or redder, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Thedalund, and Theedle soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Kishona soils have a lithochromic hue no redder than 7.5YR.  El Rancho soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand throughout the major portion of the particle-size control section. Paradox and Mikim soils have dry moisture control sections for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to July 15, when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  Pojoaque soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand and 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments throughout the particle-size control section. Tsosie soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Neville soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  The soil formed in thick, calcareous, alluvial fan material derived from redbed loamstones, siltstone, and shales.  The annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer inches.  Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F; mean summer temperature is 67 degrees F."
