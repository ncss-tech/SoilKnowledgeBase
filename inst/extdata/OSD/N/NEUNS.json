These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section from mid July to October (90 to 150 days) and moist in all parts December to April.  The soil ranges from slightly to very strongly acid.  Base saturation below 10 inches ranges from 25 to 60 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 8 to 18 percent clay and amount of rock fragments averages 35 to 70 percent, mainly gravel.  Stones make up 0 to 15 percent of the upper part of the A horizon and on the surface.\nThe A horizon color is 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 6/2,; 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 6/5 or 6/6..

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nThe Bt horizon has a minimal clay increase but it is not enough to qualify for an argillic horizon within a distance of 12 inches.\nThis is a change in type location but does not change the concept nor the classification.\nThe series concept is narrowed to reflect a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F.  Neuns mapped in other areas will be updated.\nThe series type location was moved from Glenn County to Siskiyou County in 1985.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to about 8 inches (A and AB horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from about 8 to 35 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizon).\nLithic contact - the boundary at about 35 inches (R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was sampled by UC Davis 6-75.  Pedon number 75-CA-47-117X, Four pedons sampled by NSSL SCA78-033-031, SCA92-043-103, S79CA-045-011 and S92CA-043-103.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
