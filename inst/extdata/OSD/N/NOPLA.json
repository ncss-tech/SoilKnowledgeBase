  "OVERVIEW": "The Nopla series consists of very deep, well drained soils on shield volcanos and ground moraines. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. These soils formed in local alluvium derived from loess, volcanic ash and igneous rocks. Nopla soils have moderately slow permeability. The mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",
