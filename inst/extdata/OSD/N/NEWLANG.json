  "OVERVIEW": "The Newlang series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed dominantly in siliceous sandy alluvium on flood plains. These soils have rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth in the following paragraph are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches. The control section has more than 50 percent medium, coarse, and very coarse sand and less than 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  The soil has less than 10 percent weatherable minerals throughout (0.02 to 2 mm fraction).   Base saturation (by NH4OAc) is less than 50 percent in some part within 40 inches. Volume of chert or sandstone gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.  Redox accumulations are in or below the A horizon, or both, in some pedons. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are typically 50 percent or more of the matrix below the A horizon and within 20 inches.  Aquic conditions occur within a depth of 1 foot for long periods in most years.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR or it is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3; and chroma is 0 or 1.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5 or it is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  It is mucky sand, mucky loamy sand, sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is the color of the uncoated sand grains with some organic staining.\nSome pedons have a BCg or BC horizon with hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 1 to 6.  The color is that of the uncoated sand grains.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 8; and chroma of 2 to 6.  The color is that of the uncoated sand grains."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

The most likely period is March to June but flooding can occur at any time after heavy rains.  Newlang soils have an apparent seasonal high water table from 1 foot above to 1 foot below the surface for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period October to June in 6 or more out of 10 years."
