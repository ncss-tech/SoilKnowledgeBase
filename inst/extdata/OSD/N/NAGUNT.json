  "OVERVIEW": "The Nagunt series consists of very deep, subaqueous soils permanently submerged or in the intertidal zone of tidal estuarine  washover fan flats, washover fan slopes, sandy shoals, submerged beaches and floodtidal deltas in coastal lagoons and estuaries. Nagunt soils are formed in sandy marine deposits as a result of washover events, eolian deposition, and tidal flooding. Buried surface horizons and stratification are often identified.  Slope ranges from 0 through 15 percent, mean annual air temperature is 10 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is 1295 mm.",

Gravel and shell content is 0 to 35 percent throughout the profile. Consistence is nonfluid throughout. All horizons have a pH of neutral through strongly alkaline and oxidized pH of extremely acid through moderately alkaline. At least one horizon within 100 cm of the soil surface has an oxidized pH of 4.0 or less. Soil has a 5:1 salinity greater than 0.6 dS/m throughout the profile. All horizons are structureless single grain or massive and nonfluid. After drying, it is common for many of these soils to develop 5Y 5/4 mottles throughout the matrix.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 10Y, or is neutral, value of 2.5 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 3. The textures can have a mucky modifier.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe Aseb horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.

Pishagqua soils are found on low energy lagoon bottoms and have greater than 100 cm of highly fluid, sulfidic, silt loam at the soil surface.

Peraquic feature - the zone from 0 to 200 cm has positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 2.0 m of salt water).\n2. Reduced conditions - the zone from 0 to 200 cm.\n3. Sulfidic horizon - the zones from 41 to 54 cm and 69 to 74 cm have a pH of 4.0 or less after 8 weeks of moist incubation (Aseb and A'seb horizons).\n4. Particle-size control section - zone from 25 to 100 cm (Cg1, Cg2, Aseb, Cg, A'seb, C'g, and C''g horizons)."
