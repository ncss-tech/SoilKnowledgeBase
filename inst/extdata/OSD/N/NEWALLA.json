The boundary between the Bt1 and 2Bt is clear or abrupt. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt and 2Btss horizons have hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is silty clay or clay and the clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent. Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 0 to 2. Base saturation (by sum of cations) ranges from 35 to 85 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline. Redoximorphic concentrations in shades of red, yellow, or brown may be present below 30 inches.\nThe 2Btkss and 2Btksshorizons have hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is clay or silty clay and the clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent. Base saturation (by sum of cations) ranges from 55 to 98 percent. Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 3 to 7. Soft masses of calcium carbonate range from 0 to 10 percent by volume. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Redoximorphic concentrations in shades of red, yellow, or brown may be present.\nThe 2BC or 2BCk horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Most pedons have redox concentrations in shades of red, yellow, or brown. Texture is sandy clay, silty clay, gravelly silty clay, or very gravelly silty clay and the clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent. Shale fragments from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter range from 0 to 50 percent by volume. Base saturation (by sum of cations) ranges from 75 to 79 percent. Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 5 to 10. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Some pedons are streaked in shades of brown, yellow, or gray. In some pedons the 2Cr horizon is interbedded with thin beds of sandstone. In some pedons the 2Cr horizon has slight or very slight effervescent. Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 5 to 12. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline. This material is non paralithic and excavation difficulty is low or moderate. Fractures are greater than 10 cm apart. This material is dense enough to be root restrictive. Most of this material slakes in water within 15 hours."

Darnell and Darsil soils lack an argillic horizon and are less than 20 inches thick over sandstone. Darnell and Darsil soils are mainly on the ridge crests. Grainola soils are on side slopes of prairie uplands. Harrah, Littleaxe, and Stephenville soils have a fine-loamy control section. In addition, Harrah soils have a solum more than 72 inches thick and Stephenville soils have a solum from 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone. Harrah soils are on lower foot slopes and side slopes. Littleaxe soils are on ridge crests and Stephenville soils are on landscapes similar to Newalla soils. Renfrow soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick and are on higher prairie uplands."
