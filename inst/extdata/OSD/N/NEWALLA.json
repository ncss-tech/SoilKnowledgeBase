  "OVERVIEW": "The Newalla series consists of deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. The upper part formed in material weathered from sandstone and the lower part formed in material weathered from shale of Permian age. These soils are on very gently sloping to steep summits and back slopes of uplands in the Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 33 inches. Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",

Grainola soils are on side slopes of prairie uplands. Harrah, Littleaxe, and Stephenville soils have a fine-loamy control section. In addition, Harrah soils have a solum more than 72 inches thick and Stephenville soils have a solum from 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone. Harrah soils are on lower foot slopes and side slopes. Littleaxe soils are on ridge crests and Stephenville soils are on landscapes similar to Newalla soils. Renfrow soils have a solum more than 60 inches thick and are on higher prairie uplands."
