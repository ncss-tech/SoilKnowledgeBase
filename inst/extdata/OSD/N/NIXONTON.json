This revision changes the series to a fine-silty family of Typic Hapludults. The 2008 edits were to correct the water table depth in RIC and add latitude and longitude.(DTA)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name  Slope Airtemp  FrFr/Seas  Precip  Elevation\nNC0001 NIXONTON    0-3  59-63    185-240    46-52   5-25\nSOI-5   FloodL  FloodH   Watertable    Kind     Months    Bedrock\nNC0001   NONE             4.0-6.0    APPARENT   DEC-MAR    >60\nSOI-5    Depth    Texture         3-Inch   No-10   Clay%    CEC\nNC0001   0-23    VFSL L SIL        0-0    98-100   5-18     3-20\nNC0001   23-61   L SICL CL         0-0    100-100  18-35    4-8\nNC0001   61-127   SIL L SL         0-0    100-100   8-25    2-6\nNC0001   127-152  LFS LS FS        0-0    98-100   3-12     1-10\nSOI-5     Depth     pH       O.M.
