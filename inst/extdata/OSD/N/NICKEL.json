  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Alemeda, Chamberino, Corazones, Dime, Piquin, Railroad (T), and Stagecoach series. Alemeda soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Chamberino soils have loam or sandy clay loam textures with 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and contain 35 to 50 percent rock fragments. Corazones soils do not receive significant precipitation during December through March. Dime soils have thin Bt horizons and are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section. Piquin soils moisture control section has the most moisture between July and September and is in the 8 to 10 inch precipitation zone. Railroad soils have a lithic contact at 30 to 40 inches. Stagecoach soils are moist in the moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative from June through September, have a moisture distribution pattern typical of the Sonoran Desert and are in the 10 to 13 inch precipitation zone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nickel soils are on fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Elevations are 1,800 to 4,000 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 7 inches; mean annual temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is 170 to 300 days."
