The mollic epipedon is 7 to 18 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. It has angular or prismatic structure. Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btc horizon has value of 4 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.

These soils formed in alluvium influenced by loess over a duripan. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 17 inches. The average January temperature is 29 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."

Goldendale soils are on plateaus and are more than 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Konner soils are on flood plains and are somewhat poorly drained. Lorena soils are on plateaus, are fine-loamy and are moderately deep to basalt. Mondovi soils are on flood plains, are fine-silty and generally have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches deep. Swalecreek soils are on terraces and are fine-loamy."
