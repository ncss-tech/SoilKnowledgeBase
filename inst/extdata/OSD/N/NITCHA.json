  "OVERVIEW": "The Nitcha series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Nitcha soils are on terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 [SW1]inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F..",
