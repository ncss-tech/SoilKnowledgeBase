These soils formed in alluvium over flood deposits with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Elevations are 1,400 to 2,400 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches[SW15]. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."
