  "OVERVIEW": "The Novary series consists of very deep, poorly drained   soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on floodplains, drainageways, swales, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
