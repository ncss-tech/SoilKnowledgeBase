  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ninemile soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 1,585 to 2,530 meters.  In Oregon elevation ranges as low as 1,250 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

Beden soils are loamy and have ashy textured A horizons.  Home Camp soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Karlo soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts and have slickensides through their control section.  Newlands soils are fine-loamy, deep to lithic contacts, and have a cryic temperature regime.  Westbutte soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have a xeric moisture regime."
