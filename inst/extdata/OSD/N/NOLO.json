  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 55 inches. Bedrock is at 40 to 60 inches or more. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 16 to 30 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 to 20 percent in the solum above the fragipan and from 10 to 35 percent in the fragipan. Reaction throughout soil, unless limed, is very strongly acid or extremely acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Ped interiors have many to common high and low chroma redoximorphic features. Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Sand content is greater than 20 percent in the particle-size control section. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or fine subangular blocky or blocky. Consistence ranges from firm to friable.\nThe Btx horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y. Prism faces have value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Ped interiors have value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 6. Ped interiors have many to common high and low chroma redoximorphic features. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate very coarse prismatic parting to medium or thick platy or subangular blocky. Consistence is very firm or firm and brittle.\nSome pedons have a thin very channery loam C horizon having coarse prismatic or massive structure and firm consistence."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the only series in this family at this time.\nThe Andover, Cokesbury, Lamington and Shelmadine series were formerly in the same family. The Andover soils formed in colluvium, average 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and are in the active CEC class. Cokesbury soils have gneiss and schist rock fragments rather than sandstone. Lamington soils have hue redder than 7.5YR and are in a semiactive CEC class.  Shelmadine soils formed in pre-Wisconsin age glacial till and have less sand and more silt in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nearly level to strongly sloping broad ridgetops and plateaus. Slope gradients are dominantly less than 5 percent with an extreme range of 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in brownish gray, acid material weathered mostly from sandstone and includes some materials from shale and siltstone. The climate is humid temperate. Mean annual air temperatures ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F., mean annual rainfall ranges from 36 to 50 inches, and the frost free season ranges from 140 to 170 days."
