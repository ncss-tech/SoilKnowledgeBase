  "OVERVIEW": "The Nolo series consists of deep and very deep, poorly drained soils formed in residuum primarily from sandstone but includes some materials from shale and siltstone. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and low in the fragipan. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

The Andover soils formed in colluvium and average 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Cokesbury soils have gneiss and schist rock fragments rather than sandstone. Lamington soils have hue redder than 7.5YR and are in a semiactive CEC class.  Shelmadine soils formed in pre-Wisconsin age glacial till, have less sand and more silt in the particle-size control section, and also are in a semiactive CEC class."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 35 centimeters (Oa, A, Eg  horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 47 inches (Btg, Btx horizon).\n3. Fragipan - the zone from 17 to 47 inches (Btx horizon).\nAvailable laboratory data is inconsistent regarding the presence of an argillic horizon.  Also, the data suggests that some Nolo is actually in a coarse-loamy family.  Further study is needed."
