Thickness of the solum is 32 to greater than 60 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to greater than 60 inches.  The pH of the mineral horizons ranges from 4.0 to 6.0.\nThe E and Eb horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  They are weakly smeary throughout.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Gravel and cobble content is 0 to 14 percent.  They are moderately smeary throughout.  Organic carbon is assumed to be 12 to 16 percent.  Some pedons have Bs horizons with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4.\nThe 2Bhsb and where present the 2Bsb horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR value of 2.5 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fines is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent and include 10 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 50 percent cobble, and 0 to 10 percent stone.  They are moderately smeary throughout. Organic carbon content is assumed to be 5 to 12 percent.\nThe 2BC horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fines is very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent and include 20 to 70 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobble, and 0 to 10 percent stone.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon.  The 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fines is loam or sandy loam.

Kasitsna soils have a particle size control section that is medial over loamy skeletal. Portgraham soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have a particle size control section that is medial.  Seldovia soils have a particle size control section that is medial."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nanwalek soils are formed in an ash mantle over reworked glacial till and colluvial deposits.  Volcanic ash has been incorporated into the underlying till and colluvium to depths of 60 inches or more by leaching and mass movement.   Nanwalek soils are on mountainslopes.  Slopes range from 25 to 150 percent.  Elevations are 20 to 2000 feet.\nThe climate is maritime with mild winters and cool summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 65 to 85 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 70 to 150 inches.  Mean January temperature is 23 degrees F., mean July temperature is 58 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature ranges from 34 to 42 degrees F."

Kasitsna and Seldovia soils occur on similar landscapes but on more stable geomorphic surfaces and generally support a forest of Sitka spruce.  Tutka soils have bedrock within 20 inches and occur on glacially abraded bedrock ridges."
