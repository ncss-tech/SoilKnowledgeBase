The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 5 to 15 percent clay.  Depth to densic glacial till ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.

Belzar, Hartill, Huntrock, Kloochman, Oxerine, and Wilma soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Bertolotti soils lack a 2Cd horizon and are moderately to strongly acid.  Scotties soils lack a 2Cd horizon.  Cliffdell soils have a solum more than 30 inches thick.  Illabot soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Inkler soils lack a 2Cd horizon and have 15 to 50 percent gravel in the Bw horizon.  McCree soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock. Newbell soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Talls soils have clay bands in the 2A and 2B horizons.  Threemile soils have free carbonates in the lower part of the control section.  Ohscow soils lack a 2Cd horizon, have 35 to 70 angular granitic rock fragments and 2 to 8 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Redriver soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and are dry for 90 consecutive days.  Veridge and Wilma soils are 20 to 40 inches to lithic contact.  Wilmont soils are dominated by channer rock fragments and are very channery or extremely channery in the particle-size control section."

The control section is not contrasting because the ashy part is 3 inches thick and this material needs to be 4 or more inches thick for pedon to be strongly contrasting; thus the thickest part is used which is loamy-skeletal.\nAndic properties from 1 to 14 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
