  "OVERVIEW": "The Nahma series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy deposits overlying limestone, dolomitic sandstone, or dolomite bedrock. These soils are in depressional ground moraines and bedrock benches. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
