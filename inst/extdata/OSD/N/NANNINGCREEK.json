  "OVERVIEW": "The Nanningcreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone with minor amounts of siltstone and gravelly conglomerate. Nanningcreek soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1525 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
