  "OVERVIEW": "The Newvil series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine sediments. Newvil soils are on eroded fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 275 mm and the mean annual temperature is 8 degrees C.",
