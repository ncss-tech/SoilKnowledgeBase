Newton soils formed in acid sandy sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1016 mm (30 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 10.6 degrees C (44 to 51 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 170 days. Elevation is 177 to 311 meters (580 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford, Granby, and Maumee soils, and the very poorly drained Zadog soils are in lower lying depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Morocco soils are on slight rises. The excessively drained Oakville and Plainfield soils are on knolls and ridges."

Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between December and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid."
