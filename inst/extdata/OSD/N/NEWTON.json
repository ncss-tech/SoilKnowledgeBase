  "OVERVIEW": "The Newton series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in sandy sediments on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
