  "OVERVIEW": "The Nidix series consists of moderately deep well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone.  These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 33 centimeters (13 inches).  The average annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location.",
