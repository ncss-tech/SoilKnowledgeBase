Base saturation ranges from 10 to 30 percent.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 2 or 3. The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the A horizon ranges from sandy loam to loam. Reaction is medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe B21t and the B22t horizons have a hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8. Mottles in shades of red and yellow range from none to common. Gray mottles due to wetness range from none to common in the B21t or B22t, but low chroma are within 24 inches of the top of the Bt. The B23t horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, chroma of 1 or 2. Mottles in shade of red, yellow, and brown range from none to common. Texture of the Bt is clay or silty clay with a clay content of 40 to 60 percent.

Annemaine and Eulonia soils have mica flakes in the lower sola. Beason, Craven, Dogue, Helena, Lignum, and Wolftever soils have B21t horizons with colors of 7.5YR hue of yellower; in addition, Helena and Lignum soils overlie piedmont rocks. Creedmore soils have B1 and upper B2 horizons that have a yellowish matrix color and overlie piedmont rocks. Etoile and Woodtell soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent. Sacul soils are on Eocene and older geological formations and are assumed to have chemical differences. Stapp soils are 40 to 60 inches deep over tilted bedrock. Angie soils have sola greater than 60 inches. Kirvin and Urland soils lack gray mottles due to wetness within 30 inches of the surface. Nemours soils are underlain by loamy sand. Rosenwall and Vinita soils have sola less than 40 inches thick."

These soils formed in stratified loamy and clayey sediments of Pleistocene Age, mainly of the Willis formation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches. Summer rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches. Summer moisture deficit ranges from 0 to 4 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 degrees to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 72."
