  "OVERVIEW": "The Niklavar series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy stratified alluvium over very gravelly alluvium. Niklavar soils are on floodplains and low stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 33 to 36 degrees F. The upper part of the control section is stratified with textures that include sand, fine sand, very fine sand, and silt. Depth to very gravelly alluvium ranges from 24 to less than 40 inches in thickness over very and extremely gravelly sand. The weighted average of the upper control section has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. Organic carbon content varies irregularly with increasing depth.\nThe A and AC horizons has hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam, loamy fine sand, and fine sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe C horizon have hue of 10YR to 5Y; value from 3 or 4; and chroma of 1 to 4. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Cg horizons have hue of 10YR to 5GY; value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. These horizons have common to many greenish gray through red redoximorphic features present. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon is variegated. Texture is sand modified by 40 to 70 percent coarse fragments, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 30 to 50 percent gravel. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."
