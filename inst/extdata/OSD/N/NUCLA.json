  "OVERVIEW": "The Nucla series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in calcareous alluvium or wind modified calcareous alluvium on ridge side slopes, terraces, and alluvial fans.  Nucla soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 33 centimeters (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.) at the type location.",
