    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 40 to more than 60 inches thick.  The soil ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline and is noncalcareous throughout. Stone cover on the surface ranges from 5 to 25 percent. Mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F. The soils are usually dry during the period the soil temperature ls above 41 degrees F. They are moist in some part of the moisture control section for 30 to 40 days during the summer months and are dry for 70 to 85 days during the 120 days following the winter solstice.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. The combinations of color value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 extend to depths of less than 7 inches. The Al horizon is very stony sandy loam or stony sandy loam and contains 30 to 65 percent rock fragments.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is mainly stony clay or sandy clay but in some pedons it is very cobbly or very gravelly sandy clay.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 70 percent. This horizon has moderate or strong, medium or coarse, prismatic structure that parts to moderate or strong, very fine through medium, angular or subangular blocky structure. It is 15 to 27 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is stony, very stony, very cobbly or very gravelly sandy loam, or very cobbly loamy sand and it contains 35 to 80 percent rock fragments."

These soils formed alluvium and residuum weathered from coarse grained acid igneous rock, quartzite conglomerate, and with minor influence from basalt. Mean annual temperature is 52 to 58 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 70 to 75 degrees F., average annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches, and frost-free period is 120 to 160 days."
