  "OVERVIEW": "The Neiberger series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over residuum derived from shale.  Neiberger soils are on summits, shoulders, sideslopes and footslopes of hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
