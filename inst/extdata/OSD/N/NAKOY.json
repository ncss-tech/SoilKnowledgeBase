  "OVERVIEW": "The Nakoy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material over alluvium derived from sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.  Nakoy soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
