    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 (after mixing) to 16 inches.  The depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 22 inches.  One or more lag lines are in the upper sediment or at the contact with the till in some pedons.  The content of rock fragments ranges from a trace to 15 percent in the upper sediment, 15 to 35 percent in the lag line, and 2 to 15 percent in the till.  The fragments are of mixed lithology, but limestone and granite are dominant components.  The depth to the coarse-loamy till is 10 to 36 inches.  These soils are saturated with water within depths of 40 inches during some part of the growing seasons in most years unless artificially drained.  Redoximorphic features are within depths of 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It has weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have an E horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  Its range in texture is the same as the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam averaging less than 18 percent clay.  It has rock fragments that are more than 5 mm in diameter.  It typically has weak or moderate, angular or subangular blocky structure, but in some pedons it has weak or moderate prismatic primary structure.  Clay films are faint or distinct and patchy to continuous.  It ranges from neutral or slighlty alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2Bw horizon up to 5 inches thick.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has few to many redoximorphic features.  The texture is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam or gravelly loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has a matrix with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  These horizons have few to many redoximorphic features.  The texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogues.  It is friable or very friable. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent and the horizons qualifies as a calcic horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has few to many redoximorphic features.  The texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 30 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are in the Linveldt and Oylen series.  Oylen soils do not have calcic or Bk horizons.  In addition, they have rock fragments less than 5 millimeters in diameter in the argillic horizons and are underlain by sandy material.  Linveldt soils have a layer of sandy material between the mantle and the underlying glacial till."
