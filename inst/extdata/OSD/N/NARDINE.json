  "OVERVIEW": "The Nardine series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium mixed with loess in the surface.  Nardine soils are on areas near mountain meadows.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
