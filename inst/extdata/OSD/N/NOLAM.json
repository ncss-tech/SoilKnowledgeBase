  "OVERVIEW": "The Nolam series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in alluvial sediments derived from rhyolite and andesite on terraces and piedmonts.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
