  "OVERVIEW": "The Nickin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are moderately deep to siliceous sandy pedisediment or residuum.  These soils formed in a mantle of wind or water-laid loamy deposits; in loamy till; and in the underlying siliceous sandy pedisediment or residuum on hills.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy mantle and in the till; moderately rapid or rapid in the sandy part of the subsoil; and rapid or very rapid in the substratum.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Combined thickness of the loamy mantle and the loamy till ranges from 20 to 39 inches and coincides with the depth to siliceous sandy pedisediment or residuum. Clay content of the particle-size control section averages from 18 to 25 percent.  Rock fragments generally do not occur in the upper loamy mantle. Volume of gravel ranges from 1 to 10 percent in the till. Volume of sandstone channers range from 0 to 10 percent in the sandy pedisediment or residuum. Reaction naturally is strongly acid or moderately acid in the upper loamy mantle but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the till subsoil and in the sandy pedisediment or residuum. The Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is loam or sandy loam.\nThe 3Bt horizon typically has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR but, in some pedons, it has hue of 5YR.  Value and chroma are 3 or 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sand or sand."
