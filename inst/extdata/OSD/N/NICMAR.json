  "OVERVIEW": "The Nicmar series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till and colluvium from volcanic and sedimentary rock, with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes are 15 to 65 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches. The mean January temperature is 22 to 26 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.
