    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nicmar soils are found on lower backslopes and footslopes of mountains and have slopes of 15 to 65 percent. Elevations are from 2,200 to 5,000 feet. These soils formed in mixed till and colluvium from volcanic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches. The mean January temperature is 22 to 26 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
