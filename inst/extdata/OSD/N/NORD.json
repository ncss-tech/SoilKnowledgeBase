  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The moisture control section of 8 to 24 inches is moist in all parts from about December 15 to April 15.  It is dry in all parts from July 15 to November.  Mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The organic matter is more than 1 percent at a depth of 20 inches and decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  Carbonates range from noneffervescent to violently effervescent, and few fine to common medium filaments and threads.  Some part of the particle-size control section always contains some carbonates. Many areas have had the amount and distribution of carbonates altered by farming activities.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/3, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2 and moist color of 3/1, 3/2 or 3/3.  It is loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/2; or 2.5Y 5/2 or 6/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, or 4/2; 7.5YR 4/4.  Dry values of 5 and moist values of 3 occur in the upper C horizon.  Redoximorphic concentrations of iron occur below a depth of 4 feet in some pedons.  These iron concentrations are not the result of the present day water table.  The iron concentrations increase in number near old slough areas.  Textures are loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Clay content is 10 to 18 percent. Some pedons have strata of loamy coarse sand to coarse sandy loam.  Some pedons have silt loam and clay loam strata below a depth of 40 inches, which are unrelated to the soil horizons above.  Reaction is usually neutral to moderately alkaline, but may be strongly alkaline if saline-sodic affected.\nThe buried A horizon is not present in all pedons.  Some pedons have buried Bt horizons that are the same as the C horizons except that they have few to common, thin to moderately thick clay films on ped faces, lining pores, or bridging sand grains."

The climate is semiarid and has hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 45 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 81 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.

Foster soils have a mollic epipedon that is less than 20 inches thick and have a regular decrease in organic-carbon with increasing depth.  Grangeville soils have redox depletions and aquic conditions in most years or are artificially drained.  Hanford, Kimberlina and Wasco soils lack mollic epipedons."
