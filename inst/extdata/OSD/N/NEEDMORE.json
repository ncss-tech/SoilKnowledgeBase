Fragments of shale range from 0 to 35 percent in the A and B horizons and 0 to 70 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid except where limed.  The C horizon or the subhorizon above bedrock is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam except that eroded areas are silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons are mottled in shades of yellow, brown, and red.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Some pedons have a thin horizon of silty clay loam in the upper Bt.\nThe C horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Bt horizon of is mottled in shades of these colors.  Texture is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam."
