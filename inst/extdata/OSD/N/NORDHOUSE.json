The somewhat poorly drained Pipestone and Saugatuck soils and the very poorly drained Kingsville soils are on lower landscape positions. The well drained Epworth soils and the moderately well drained Covert soils have darker colored subsoils. Epworth soils are found on older sand dunes further removed from the Great Lakes shoreline."
