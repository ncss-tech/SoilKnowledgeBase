  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 0 to 39 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 6 to 17 percent clay and 30 to 68 percent silt.  Rock fragments are angular sandstone fragments.  Volume of rock fragments averages from 35 to 60 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of channers ranges from 2 to 15 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 15 to 35 percent in the argillic horizon.  Volume of flagstones ranges from 5 to 25 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 20 to 45 percent in the argillic horizon. Stones are on the surface and in the solum. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  The o horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is silt loam, loam, sandy loam or the channery, very channery, flaggy, or very flaggy analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 3 to 5. It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam or the channery, very channery, flaggy, or very flaggy analogs.  Where the Bw horizon has spodic colors, it has pH of 6.0 or more or organic carbon content less than 0.6 percent, or both.\nNorthmound soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color like the E horizon described above.  Typically it is very channery or very flaggy analogs of silt loam, loam, or sandy loam but thin subhorizons are the channery or flaggy analogs.\nThe Bt of the E/B or B/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It has texture like the E part described above.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons with a silty mantle have a 2E/B or 2B/E horizon, or both.  The 2E part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The 2Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The 2E and 2Bt parts are typically very channery or very flaggy analogs of loam or sandy loam but are the channery or flaggy analogs in some pedons.\nPedons with a silty mantle have a 2Bt horizon with color and texture like the 2Bt part described above."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Norbeck, Ribhill, and Rumblecreek  series.  Similar soils are the Fenwood, Marathon, and Mosinee series.  Norbeck and Rumblecreek soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 40 inches. Ribhill soils have mostly angular quartzite rock fragments with a few rounded igneous rock fragments in some pedons.  Fenwood soils are fine-loamy and have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.  Marathon soils are coarse-loamy and do not have a lithic contact.  Mosinee soils do not have a glossic horizon or an argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Northmound soils are on summits, shoulders, and side slopes of unglaciated sandstone monadnocks.  Slope gradients range from 6 to 50 percent.  Northmound soils typically formed in a loess mantle and in a mixture of loess and residuum from the underlying sandstone but some pedons formed entirely in a loamy mixture of loess and residuum.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1,950 feet."

The moderately well drained Flambeau and Loyal soils are at lower elevations, on till plains surrounding the unglaciated monadnocks, where the soil is very deep to sandstone.  The moderately well drained Hiles and Humbird soils are at lower elevations adjacent to the monadnocks where the soil is moderately deep to interbedded sandstone and shale."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Common trees are sugar maple, northern red oak, white oak, American basswood, bitternut hickory, and aspen.  Some of the less sloping areas have been cleared of trees and stones and are used for cropland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay."
