(Colors are for moist soil.)\nA--0 to 3 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) fine sand; single grained; loose; strongly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.  (1 to 3 inches thick)\nC--3 to 80 inches; reddish brown (5YR 4/3) fine sand; single grained; loose; common medium distinct dark reddish brown, reddish brown, and dark reddish gray streaks and splotches of organic matter and iron stains throughout; strongly acid."

Soil reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.  Content of silt plus clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section is less than 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Thin dark streaks are in the surface horizon of some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Many pedons have black or dark reddish brown splotches.  These dark colors are organic matter and iron stains from spodic horizons destroyed in the mining process."

Archbold, Astatula, Candler, St. Lucie, and Tavares soils do not have low value colors in the C horizons.  In addition, Archbold and Tavares soils have a water table, and Candler soils have lamellae.  Fripp, Kershaw, Newhan, and Ortega soils also do not have low value colors in the C horizons, and have temperatures of 72 degrees F., or less at depths of 20 inches beneath the surface.  In addition, Newhan soils are affected by salt spray, and do not support tree growth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Neilhurst soils are on gently undulating to rolling ridges and valleys in reclaimed and mined areas.  Slopes are commonly 2 to 5 percent but range from 1 to 12 percent with steeper areas occurring as short sideslopes.  The soil formed in sandy spoil from mining operations that have been reworked by wind.  Some areas have been smoothed and shaped by earth moving equipment."
