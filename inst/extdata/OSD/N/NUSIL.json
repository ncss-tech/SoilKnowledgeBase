Runoff is negligible on slopes of less than 1 percent, low on 1 to 5 percent slopes. Permeability is rapid in the fine sand A and E horizons, moderately rapid in the loamy fine sand A and E horizons, slow in the upper part of the Bt horizon and moderately slow in the lower part of the Bt horizon. A perched water table is at the contact of the Bt horizon is some years. After heavy rainfalls during the winter and spring months the water table is usually less than 15 cm (6 in) thick and persists for very brief or brief periods. A water table more than 13 cm (5 in) thick exists for less than 1 week."

The most common crops grown are peanuts, watermelons or vegetables. Native vegetation consist of grasses such as little bluestem, brownseed paspalum, Indiangrass, switchgrass, tanglehead, fringeleaf paspalum, and hooded windmillgrass. Woody vegetation consists mainly of live oaks, mesquite, pricklypear, and catclaw acacia."

Water table studies on similar soils indicate that there is minimal to no water saturation. These soils may have been deposited from a sandy source material by two different episodes comprising fairly uniform parent materials.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 91 cm (0 to 36 in).
