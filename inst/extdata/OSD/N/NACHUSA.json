  "OVERVIEW": "The Nachusa series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in a thin layer of loamy aeolian deposits and in glacial till that contains a paleosol on till plains.  They are moderately permeable in the upper loamy sediments and moderately slowly permeable in the lower paleosolic till.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches).",
