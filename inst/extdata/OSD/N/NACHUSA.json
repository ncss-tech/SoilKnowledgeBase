Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loamy aeolian sediments and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the paleosolic till. Permeability is moderate in the loamy aeolian sediments and moderately slow in the paleosolic till.  Water commonly is perched above the paleosolic horizon during winter and spring months."
