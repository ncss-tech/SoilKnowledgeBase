The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It has weak or moderate blocky structure.  It is dominantly loam but is fine sandy loam below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  It is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y dry, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Newskah soils are on marine terraces and dissected terrace flanks.  Slopes are 1 to 90 percent.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 500 feet.  These soils formed in material weathered from weakly coherent sandy marine sediments.  They are in humid marine climate with cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches.  The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 59 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 180 to 220 days."
