  "OVERVIEW": "The Newskah series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandy marine sediments.  Newskah soils are on marine terraces and terrace escarpments and have slopes of 1 to 90 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches.",

The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It has weak or moderate blocky structure.  It is dominantly loam but is fine sandy loam below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  It is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y dry, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.
