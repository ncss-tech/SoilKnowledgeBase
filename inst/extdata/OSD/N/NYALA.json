  "OVERVIEW": "The Nyala series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff, shale, and limestone. Nyala soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
