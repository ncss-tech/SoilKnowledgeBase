These soils formed in alluvium weathered mainly from limestone and dolomite Elevations are 1,800 to 4,000 feet. The climate is low-latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. Mean annual precipitation is 4 to 7 inches. Mean annual temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 220 to 300 days."
