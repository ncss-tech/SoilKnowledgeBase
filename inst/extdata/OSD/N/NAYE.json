  "OVERVIEW": "The Naye series consists of moderately deep to a petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in alluvium mainly from limestone and dolomite. Naye soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
