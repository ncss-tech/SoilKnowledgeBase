  "OVERVIEW": "The Nissler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium from rhyolite and other moderately fine-grained igneous rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills and ridges.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 432 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
