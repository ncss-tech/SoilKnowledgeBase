    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Noark soils are on nearly level to very steep uplands of the Ozark Highlands.  These soils formed in colluvium and clayey residuum weathered from cherty limestone. Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 45 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Arkana, Clarksville, Captina, Moko, Nixa and Tonti series.  Arkana soils are near limestone outcrops, have a very-fine control section, a 20 to 40 inch solum, and higher base saturation.  Clarksville soils occur on similar sideslope positions as Noark soils and have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Captina soils occur on broad flats, have a fine-silty control section, and a fragipan. Moko soils are near limestone outcrops, have a loamy-skeletal control section, a 10 to 20 inch sola and higher base saturation.  Nixa soils are on narrow ridgetops, have a loamy-skeletal control section, and a fragipan.  Tonti soils are on broad flats, have a fine-loamy control section and a fragipan."

In Missouri they are mapped mainly in the Mississippian age Burlington and Kinderhook limestone formations.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
