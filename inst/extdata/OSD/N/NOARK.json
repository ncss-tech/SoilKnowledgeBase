  "REVDATE": "03/2006",
  "STATES": "AR,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Noark series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in colluvium and clayey residuum from cherty limestones. These soils are on nearly level to very steep uplands of the Ozarks.  Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

Arkana soils are near limestone outcrops, have a very-fine control section, a 20 to 40 inch solum, and higher base saturation.  Clarksville soils occur on similar sideslope positions as Noark soils and have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Captina soils occur on broad flats, have a fine-silty control section, and a fragipan. Moko soils are near limestone outcrops, have a loamy-skeletal control section, a 10 to 20 inch sola and higher base saturation.  Nixa soils are on narrow ridgetops, have a loamy-skeletal control section, and a fragipan.  Tonti soils are on broad flats, have a fine-loamy control section and a fragipan."

In Missouri they are mapped mainly in the Mississippian age Burlington and Kinderhook limestone formations."
