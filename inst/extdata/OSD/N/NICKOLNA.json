  "OVERVIEW": "The Nickolna series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess overlying loamy lacustrine deposits on lacustrine terraces and hills.  Slopes range from 4 to 16 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

Reaction ranges from strongly acid or moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe A or 2A horizons have value moist of 2 or 3; chroma moist of 1 through 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam or clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent and include gravel and cobble.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent and include 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble."
