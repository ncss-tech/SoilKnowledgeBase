There is more than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the control section.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid or moderately acid in the solum and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe A or 2A horizons have value moist of 2 or 3; chroma moist of 1 through 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam or clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent and include gravel and cobble.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent and include 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble."
