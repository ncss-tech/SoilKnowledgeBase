  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Northcote series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in clayey calcareous lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains.  These soils have slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 575 mm. Mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
