  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nalaki series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in pyroclastics.  Nalaki soils are on fan terraces surrounding and extending from cinder cones and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
