  "OVERVIEW": "The Nonesuch series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy till overlying sedimentary bedrock on ground moraines and post glacial lake shorelines.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the solum, very slow in the fragipan and moderately slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 1 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
