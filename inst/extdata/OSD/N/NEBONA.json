  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan ranges from 6 to 14 inches.  Nebona soils contain less than 0.2 percent organic matter above the duripan.  The mean annual soil temperature is 63 to 67 degrees F.  and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.   The soil is usually dry and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days.  It is usually nonsaline in the upper 1 or 2 inches but the horizons beneath the A horizon range from slightly to strongly saline or alkali.  The SAR is greater than 13.\nThe A1 horizon underlies the desert pavement.  It is very pale brown, pale brown, or light yellowish brown (10YR 7/3, 7/4, 6/3, 6/4).  Moist colors are light yellowish brown, brown, or yellowish brown (10YR 6/4, 5/3, 5/4).  This horizon is sandy loam or loam and averages 5 to 10 percent fine gravel.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C1 horizon color is similar to that of the A horizon .  The control section ranges from sandy loam to fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent fine gravel and 7 to 18 percent clay.  The duripan ranges in thickness from 4 and 26 inches and is usually massive, continuous and indurated with opal caps.  The soil beneath the duripan ranges from gravelly loamy sand to loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alko, Muroc and Stewart series in the same family and the Sodhouse (T) and Tybo series.  Alko soils have a SAR of less than 13 percent and an A1 horizon that is not covered by an erosion pavement.  Muroc soils have a paralithic contact with weathered granite under the duripan.  Stewart soils are somewhat poorly drained, are gleyed below the duripan and the moisture control section is intermittently moist in summer.  Sodhouse and Tybo soils have mesic soil temperature."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nebona soils formed on old gravelly desert pavement covered terraces derived from nonmarine mixed alluvium, and have slopes of 2 to 9 percent.  Elevation ranges from 2,200 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 or 5 inches, most of the moisture occurring as rain in late autumn and winter, though some falls as snow.  The mean annual January temperature is 46 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 84 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 65 degrees F.  The frost free season is 210 to 255 days."
