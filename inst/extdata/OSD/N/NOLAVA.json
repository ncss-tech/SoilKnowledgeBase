    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Previously, the concept of this soil was a fine-loamy PSCS and was known as the Avalon series.  Laboratory data shows a high percentage of clay sized carbonates causing it to have a coarse-loamy PSCS.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from the surface to 13 inches.  (Ap, A horizons)\nCalcic horizon:  The zone from 20 to 60 inches.  (Bk horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial reference samples from pedon 93P577 and 93P578 Uintah County, Utah 6/93.  The block description does not include CCE for the Bk2 and Bk4 because they were not part of the reference sample.   The CEC clay activity class was determined from laboratory data.\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
