  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. The soil is usually moist, but is dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for a period of less than 45 consecutive days in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The particle size control section averages 5 to 15 percent clay, and has more than 15 percent of the sand fraction which is fine sand or coarser. Below depths of 40 inches iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less and masses of oxidized iron with chroma of more than 2 may occur. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or loam with 5 to 20 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel. Soil reaction is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma 3 to 6 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is dominantly is fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam with 5 to 15 percent clay and 0 to 20 percent gravel. The lower part may be stratified with thin lenses of loamy fine sand and loam. Soil reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. This horizon typically is stratified loamy fine sand to very fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay and 0 to 30 percent gravel. Some pedons may have lenses of gravelly or very gravelly loamy sand below a depth of 40 inches with up to 50 percent gravel. Soil reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid."

Edgewick soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 49 degrees F., have an umbric epipedon 7 to 12 inches thick, become less acid with depth and are neutral or slightly acid in the lower part of the particle-size control section., . Rosman soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 59 degrees F., lack a short dry period in the summer, are moderately well drained, and have few to many mica flakes throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Nekoma soils occur on flood plains. Elevations are 10 to 750 feet. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Nekoma soils formed in recent loamy alluvium over stratified loamy to sandy alluvium derived from sandstone and siltstone. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches. The mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F. and the mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 F. The frost-free period is 140 to 240 days."

All of these soils occur on flood plains except the Meda series, which occurs on alluvial fans. Quosatana and Wasson soils are poorly drained. Gardiner soils are sandy throughout the particle-size control section. Kirkendall soils are fine-silty. Meda soils are fine-loamy. Both Kirkendall and Meda have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
