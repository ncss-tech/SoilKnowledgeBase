  "OVERVIEW": "The Neda series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and in the underlying loam till  which contains shale fragments.  These soils are on drumlins and ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
