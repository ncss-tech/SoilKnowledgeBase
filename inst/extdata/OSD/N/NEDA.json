Neda soils formed in a thin mantle of loessand in the underlying calcareous loam till  which has shale fragments.  These soils are near the base of the Niagara Escarpment in the vicinity of shale outcrops.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.6 degrees C (46 to 51 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 838 mm (28 to 33 inches)."
