  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  This alluvial soil has loamy and sandy sediments more than 80 inches thick.  The thickness of the A horizon ranges from 20 to 47 inches.  Texture of the control section is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loam, with weighted average clay content less than 18 percent, and more than 15 percent fine sand.  Thin strata and lenses of loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam occur in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and most pedons are calcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Yellowish and brownish masses of iron accumulation range from none to a few.  Texture ranges from fine sand to sandy clay loam.  Thin strata of sandy, loamy or clayey materials range from none to a few."
