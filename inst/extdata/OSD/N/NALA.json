  "OVERVIEW": "The Nala series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from mixed sources. Nala soils are on footslopes on interfluves of undulating plains. Slopes are 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
