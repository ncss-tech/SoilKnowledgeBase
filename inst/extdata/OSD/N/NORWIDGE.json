  "OVERVIEW": "The Norwidge series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and reworked loess with a mantle of volcanic ash.  They are on mountain slopes, hills, plateaus and structural benches.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 36 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
