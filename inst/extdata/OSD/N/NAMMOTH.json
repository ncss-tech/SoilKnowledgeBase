  "OVERVIEW": "The Nammoth series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and colluvium or residuum from welded tuff, rhyolite or basalt.  They are on foothills, buttes, and basalt plains.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Cassiro, Cochran, Eglirim, and Hyall soils lack lithic contacts above 40 inches.  Fivesprings soils are neutral or mildly alkaline in the argillic horizon and the rock fragments in the particle-size control section are dominantly gravel.  Pickup soils have a subhorizon of the argillic with greater than 50 percent clay and they are neutral to moderately alkaline in the argillic horizon. Ruclick soils are neutral to moderately alkaline in the argillic horizon."
