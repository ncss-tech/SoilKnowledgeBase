Cassiro, Cochran, Eglirim, and Hyall soils lack lithic contacts above 40 inches.  Fivesprings soils are neutral or mildly alkaline in the argillic horizon and the rock fragments in the particle-size control section are dominantly gravel.  Pickup soils have a subhorizon of the argillic with greater than 50 percent clay and they are neutral to moderately alkaline in the argillic horizon. Ruclick soils are neutral to moderately alkaline in the argillic horizon."

These soils formed in loess and colluvium or residuum from welded tuff, rhyolite or basalt. The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer. Average annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 13 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 85 to 100 days."
