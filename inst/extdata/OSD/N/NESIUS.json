  "OVERVIEW": "The Nesius series consists of deep, moderately well drained, rapidly permeable soils.  These soils formed in sandy sediments on outwash plains and lake plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Bellechester and Hawick soils contain carbonates within a depth of 30 inches.  Finchford soils contain 50 percent or more medium and coarse sand and have gravelly sand textures above a depth of 40 inches.  Fruitfield soils contain 70 percent medium sand or coarser and are more coarse in the control section.  Hononegah soils contain more gravel and have free carbonates in the C horizon.  Lasa aoila have texturally stratified B horizons and contain more very fine sand and less medium sand.  Sparta soils do not have low chroma mottles in the lower part of the profile.  Trempe soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the control section.  Zumbro soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick.  Ade soils have argillic horizons in the form of lamellae."
