Bellechester and Hawick soils contain carbonates within a depth of 30 inches.  Finchford soils contain 50 percent or more medium and coarse sand and have gravelly sand textures above a depth of 40 inches.  Fruitfield soils contain 70 percent medium sand or coarser and are more coarse in the control section.  Hononegah soils contain more gravel and have free carbonates in the C horizon.  Lasa aoila have texturally stratified B horizons and contain more very fine sand and less medium sand.  Sparta soils do not have low chroma mottles in the lower part of the profile.  Trempe soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the control section.  Zumbro soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick.  Ade soils have argillic horizons in the form of lamellae."

Darroch and Strole soils have more clay in the solum and are on slightly lower lying landscape positions.  Montgomery, Rensselaer, and Selma soils have gray subsoils and are in lower lying landscape positions.  Seward soils are on similar landscape positions but are underlain by silty and clayey sediments above a depth of 40 inches.  Watseka soils have gray mottles at a shallower depth and are on slightly lower lying landscape positions."
