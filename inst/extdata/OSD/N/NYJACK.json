Arnor, Arwite, Bosonoak, Dalhart, Deekay, Flugle, Iwela, Olnest, Orlie, Parkelei, Rauzi, Rockybutte, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Celavar and Evpark soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Elwop, Gateson, and Oldwolf soils do not contain volcanic ash and are more moist in May and June. Series that have not had activity classes assigned are the Augustine, Bigbow, Carri, Celacy, Dermala, Goesling, Lykorly, Maia, Pinitos, and Ribera series. Augustine, Goesling, Maia, and Pinitos soils are very deep to bedrock. Carri and Ribera soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Celacy do not have volcanic ash in their profile and are over soft sandstone and shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nyjack soils are on summits of interfluves on undulating plateaus and mesas.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium and eolian material weathered from tuff.  The elevation is 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 to 16 inches, but can range as high as 17 inches in some areas.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from the surface to a depth of about 2 inches.  (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 2 to 28 inches.  (Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons)\nParalithic contact: Moderately cemented tuff bedrock at 32 inches.  (top of 3Cr layer)\nIn February 2002 the type location was moved to the Bandelier National Monument to better reflect the Aridic Ustic moisture regime and better typify the plant community. The term 'superactive' was added to the taxonomic class.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples were analyzed for mineralogy family at the Riverside Laboratory, Sample No. R74-295.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
