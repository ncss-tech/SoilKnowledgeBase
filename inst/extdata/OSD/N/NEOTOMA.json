This will be addressed during MLRA updating activities.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Oi, A, AB horizons).\nMollic intergrade: from a depth of 2.5 to 20 cm (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 38 to 76 cm (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact: at 129 cm (top of the R layer).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon RO-52 for characterization data obtained in the immediate vicinity of the typical pedon.
