  "OVERVIEW": "The Noio series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils.  These soils formed in organic materials mixed with minor amounts of basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 460 millimeters (18 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 27 degrees C. (81 degrees F.)",

These soils are on all hillslope positions of undulating to hilly `a`a flows.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash, cinders, and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 254 to 635 millimeters (10 to 25 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2030 to 2540 millimeters (80 to 100 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 24 to 30 degrees C. (76 to 87 degrees F.)  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
