  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Noio soils are on west slopes on the undissected low elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai Volcano at elevations from sea level to 244 meters (0 to 800 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope positions of undulating to hilly `a`a flows.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash, cinders, and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 254 to 635 millimeters (10 to 25 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2030 to 2540 millimeters (80 to 100 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 24 to 30 degrees C. (76 to 87 degrees F.)  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
