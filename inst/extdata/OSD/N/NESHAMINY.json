Rock fragments of subrounded diabase and angular quartzite range from 0 to 40 percent in individual horizons of the upper part of the solum and from 0 to 60 percent in the lower part and C horizons. The rock fragment content in the particle control section averages less than 35 percent. Diabase fragments are up to 20 inches in size but quartzite fragments are usually less than 3 inches. The soil, where unlimed, ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid through slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 3. Ap horizon (where present) has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. A horizons range in texture from silty clay loam to loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. E horizons range in texture from silty clay loam to loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Sand content usually increases with depth. Structure is subangular blocky or angular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. The C horizon is variegated in some pedons. It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction."

The Brecknock series has dominant rock fragments of porcelanite and hornfel channers. The Caribel and Weedmark series receive less than 35 inches of precipitation much of it from snowfall and have hues 5YR or yellower. The Fredericktown series has depths to the base of the argillic horizon of 60 to 100 inches or more and has rock fragments dominated by gravels. The Penn series have sola dominated by red shale rock fragments and colors can range redder than 5YR. The Greencreek series does not have an OSD available."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 16 inches (Oi, Oe, A, E, and BE horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 16 to 52 inches (Bt horizon).\nRevised 02/06 JWB. The February 2006 revision adds silt loam to the range of textures in the B horizon, shifts zero datum to the top of the Oi horizon, and adjusts horizon depths accordingly. Competing series and other sections were not revised.\nRevised 02/07 JDC. 2006: Updated pedon description and competing series section. Other changes include: changing permeability to Ksat; slope range expanded to 0 to 70 percent; more detail added to pedon description including roots and pores; and textures of Bt and C horizons in RIC defined better.\n2008- Pedon description and type location updated."
