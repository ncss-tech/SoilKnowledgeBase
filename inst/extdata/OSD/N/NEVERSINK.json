  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  At least one subhorizon above 30 inches is dominated by chroma of 3 or 4. Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent in the A and B horizons and from 20 to 50 percent in the C horizon. Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam through sandy loam.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam through sandy loam.\nThe Bg horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. The Bw horizon, commonly below the Bg horizon when present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam through sandy loam. Consistence if friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam through sandy loam. Consistence is friable or firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no known series in the same family. Closely related soils are the Lamson, Massena, Newstead, Red Hook, and Sun series. These soils are all nonacid. Also closely related is the Suny series, which is the frigid analog of the Neversink series."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Neversink soils are on level or depressed parts of till plains and along small drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The soils developed in acid glacial till derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale. The climate is humid and cool-temperate. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches; and the frost-free period ranges from 110 to 150 days.  Elevation ranges from 400 to 1750 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

The very deep, somewhat poorly drained Scriba or Morris soils are associated on slightly higher landscapes. Associated in the lowest parts of the landscape are the very deep, very poorly drained Alden, Carlisle or Palms soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Neversink series was established as the acid analog of the Sun series. Original classification placed Neversink in the great group of Haplaquepts, but because of changes established in the 5th edition of \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy\" this soil now classifies in the great group of Epiaquepts. Competing series are expected to change as similar soils are reclassified.  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric Epipedon - from 0 to 5 inches (A and E horizons)\n2) Cambic horizon - from 5 to 21 inches (Bg and Bw horizons)\n3) Aquepts suborder - as evidenced by reduced matrix and/or ped faces and redoximorphic features within 20 inches of the soil surface (Eg and Bg horizons)\nSoil Interpretation Records: NY0335, NY0336\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
