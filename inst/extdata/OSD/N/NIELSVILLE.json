  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 24 inches thick.  The upper sediment does not have rock fragments.  The clayey lower part of the control section contains from 0 to 9 percent gravel and cobbles of mixed lithology.  The soil is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The salinity ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos/cm throughout the series control section.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It typically is silty clay loam but some are silt loam or silty clay with 18 to 45 percent clay and 1 to 10 percent fine sand or coarser.  The A horizon contains 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate.  Some pedons have tongues of A horizon extending into the Bk horizon.   Some pedons have an Ak horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is a silt loam or silty clay loam, averaging 18 to 34 percent clay and 1 to 10 percent fine sand or coarser.  It contains 15 to more than 30 percent calcium carbonate.  Most of this is disseminated or occurs as masses or threads.  Some pedons contain few or common, faint to prominent Fe concentrations in this horizon.\nA Bky or BC horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  In some pedons below 30 inches the hue is neutral and the chroma is 1 or less.  The texture of the C horizon is typically silty clay loam or silt loam or in some pedons stratified thin layers of very fine sandy loam, silt loam and silty clay loam, averaging 18 to 34 percent clay and 2 to 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nIn some pedons a thin layer of sand and gravel occurs between the Cg horizon and the 2Cg horizon.\nThe 2Cg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The texture of the 2Cg horizon is typically clay, or silty clay averaging 40 to 70 percent clay, 2 to 15 percent fine sand or coarser, 0 to 8 percent gravel and 0 to 1 percent cobble."

The Bear Lake, Colake, Colvin, Regan, and Winger soils have less than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Ojata soils have more than 4 mmhos/cm salinity within the series control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nielsville soils are on level lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  These soils are formed in calcareous silty lacustrine sediments over clayey till.  The climate is cool and subhumid.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  The number of frost-free days ranges from 90 to 145 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 1050 feet."
