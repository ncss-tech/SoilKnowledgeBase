  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series at this time.  Similar soils are the Armesa, Glencarb and Karro series.  Armesa and Karro soils have calcic horizons with visible masses of secondary lime ranging from soft to hard consistence and are moistened frequently by summer rainfall.  Glencarb soils have organic carbon content that decreases irregularly with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nopah soils are on inset fans, fan skirts and alluvial flats.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources of mostly limestone, with components of quartzite and reworked lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 2400 to 3000 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters, typical of the Mojave Desert.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; mean annual temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F., and frost-free season is 200 to 220 days."
