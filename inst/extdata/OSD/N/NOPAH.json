  "OVERVIEW": "The Nopah series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  The Nopah soils are on inset fans, fan skirts and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources of mostly limestone, with components of quartzite and reworked lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 2400 to 3000 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters, typical of the Mojave Desert.  The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; mean annual temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F., and frost-free season is 200 to 220 days."
