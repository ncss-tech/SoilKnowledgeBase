The somewhat poorly drained Kawkawlin soils have redox depletions in the argillic horizon, and are in lower landscape positions. The McBride soils and the well drained Montcalm soils have coarser textures and are on similar or slightly higher landscape positions. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Sims soils are on lower landscape positions. The competing Kent soils are on similar position."
