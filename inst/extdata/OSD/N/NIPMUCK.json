    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Brookfield series are in the same family.  Brookfield  soils are very deep, they do not have bedrock within 1 meter.  Series in similar families include the Cardigan, Chatfield, Lordstown, and Yalesville soils all of which formed in parent material low in iron sulfide and have a total percent (by weight) iron oxide (percent Fe by dithionate citrate times 1.43) plus percent (by weight) gibbsite of less than 10. Chatfield soils have a ratio of ammonium oxalate extractable iron to dithionite-citrate extractable iron greater than 0.15 and have pedogenic iron contents less than 1 percent throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nipmuck soils are nearly level to very steep soils on bedrock controlled hills and ridges, modified by glacial action. The soil formed in a moderately thick mantle of supraglacial melt-out till derived from iron sulfide bearing schist, sometimes interbedded with gneiss, that weathers to a reddish brown limonitic color. These formations include the Partridge and Brimfield schist formations. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is 6.7 to 11 degrees C, mean annual precipitation is 1016 to 1270 mm, and the growing season is 120 to 185 days. Elevation ranges from 0 to approximately 335 m above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brimfield, Brookfield, Canton, Charlton, and Sutton soils. The Canton, Charlton, and Sutton soils are derived from parent materials that are low in iron sulfides. Brimfield soils are less than 50 cm deep to bedrock from the mineral surface and are on similar landscape positions. Brookfield, Canton, Charlton and Sutton soils are very deep. Brookfield, Canton, and Charlton soils are commonly on lower side slopes and toe slopes and on adjacent ground moraines. Sutton soils are moderately well drained and are on depressions and lower slopes."

Common trees are white oak,  northern red oak, black oak, pignut hickory,  red maple, yellow and sweet birch,  eastern white pine and hemlock. Common understory vegetation includes mountain laurel, American witchhazel, mapleleaf viburnum, hayscented fern, Pennsylvania sedge, striped wintergreen, prince's pine, Canada mayflower, dewberry, and narrow leave low bush blueberry."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series is proposed to recognize soils that are moderately deep to bedrock associated with the very deep Brookfield and the shallow Brimfield series. These soils are thought to be post active sulfate soils which is the final stage (fossil) of the acid sulfate weathering process and explains the high pedogenic iron content and low iron ratios. Presence of sulfur is evidenced by few thin distinct jarosite coatings at 88 cm (2R layer). Research results show this pedon has a weighted average pedogenic iron (dithionite-citrate extractable iron) content in the mineral pedon of 2.7 percent and a weighted average ratio of ammonium oxalate extractable iron to pedogenic iron of 0.11 in the cambic as well as the series control section. The weighted average pedogenic iron is commonly twice that of, and extractable aluminum is commonly 1.67 times greater than historically associated soils formed in parent material that is not related to iron sulfide bearing materials. These characteristics and parasesquic mineralogy class provide a distinction from other series, particularly the Chatfield series.\nThe series name originates from the area where the series was first mapped; Nipmuck State Forest in Union, Connecticut. Series first proposed in new London County, CT 20007.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1) Ochric epipedons - the zone from 0 to 17 cm (Oe and A horizons).\n2) Cambic horizon - the zone from 17 to 59 cm (Bw horizon).\n3) Lithic contact - bedrock (Brimfield schist) at 88 cm (2R horizon).\n4) Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 88 cm (part of the Bw1, the Bw2, C1 and C2 horizons).\n5) Parasesquic mineralogy - the percent (by weight) iron oxide as Fe2O3 plus the percent (by weight) gibbsite is 11.7.\nADDITIONAL DATA: M.S. Thesis work by Shawn McVey, University of Connecticut, 2006. Characterization data for the typical pedon is S04CT011004. Additional pedon data from S04CT011001, S04CT013001, S05CT013001, and S05CT015001. Pedons analyzed by the NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
