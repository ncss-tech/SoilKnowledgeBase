  "OVERVIEW": "The Naskeag series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained soils formed in glacial till.  They are in depressions of glaciated bedrock ridges on coastal peninsulas and islands.  Permeability is rapid.  Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 45 inches at the type location.",

Stones cover 0 to 3 percent of the surface.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the O and E horizons and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the B and BC horizons.  Some pedons have an Oe horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak fine granular structure or it is single grain.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have an A horizon.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.  They have weak or moderate, very fine or fine granular structure or they are massive or single grain.  Consistence is loose, very friable, or may be weakly cemented in up to 50 percent of the horizon.  The Bs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.

They usually occur in a complex pattern with very shallow and shallow soils and rock outcrop.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range to 8 percent.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 48 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 160 days.  Elevations range from 5 to 250 feet above mean sea level."

Abram and Schoodic soils are very shallow and excessively drained soils on more convex slopes on higher positions within the landscape.  Bucksport and Wonsqueak soils are very poorly drained organic soils in bogs and depressions.  Colonel, Dixfield and Hermon soils are very deep and on more convex slopes on higher positions within the landscape.  Lyman soils are shallow, and Tunbridge soils are moderately deep, these are on knolls and more convex slopes on higher positions.  Ricker soils are thin organic soils over bedrock in convex positions."
