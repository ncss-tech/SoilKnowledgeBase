  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of soil over bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent throughout the mineral soil.  Stones cover 0 to 3 percent of the surface.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the O and E horizons and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the B and BC horizons.  Some pedons have an Oe horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak fine granular structure or it is single grain.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have an A horizon.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.  They have weak or moderate, very fine or fine granular structure or they are massive or single grain.  Consistence is loose, very friable, or may be weakly cemented in up to 50 percent of the horizon.  The Bs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand and is massive or single grain.  Consistence is loose, or may be weakly cemented in up to 50 percent of the horizon.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sand and it is massive or single grain.  Consistence is loose, or may be weakly cemented in up to 50 percent of the horizon.\nThe bedrock is mainly schist, diorite, granite, phyllite, or gneiss."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Naskeag soils formed in glacial till in depressions between shallow glaciated bedrock ridges.  They are in coastal areas, mainly on peninsulas and islands.  They usually occur in a complex pattern with very shallow and shallow soils and rock outcrop.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range to 8 percent.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 48 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 120 to 160 days.  Elevations range from 5 to 250 feet above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abram, Bucksport, Colonel, Dixfield, Hermon, Lyman, Ricker, Schoodic, Tunbridge, and Wonsqueak soils.  Abram and Schoodic soils are very shallow and excessively drained soils on more convex slopes on higher positions within the landscape.  Bucksport and Wonsqueak soils are very poorly drained organic soils in bogs and depressions.  Colonel, Dixfield and Hermon soils are very deep and on more convex slopes on higher positions within the landscape.  Lyman soils are shallow, and Tunbridge soils are moderately deep, these are on knolls and more convex slopes on higher positions.  Ricker soils are thin organic soils over bedrock in convex positions."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Albic horizon - the zone from 5 to 16 inches (E horizon).\nb.  Spodic horizon - the zone from 16 to 26 inches (Bh horizon).\nc. Aquods - has within 20 inches of the mineral surface, redoximorphic features in the albic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nThe Soil Interpretation Record Number for the Naskeag series is ME0023.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
