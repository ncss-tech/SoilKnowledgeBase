  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  Reaction of the soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, except the surface layer in areas that have been limed.  The A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Some pedons have an E horizon or an EB horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR value of 3, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon has 35 to 55 percent clay.  Ferruginous concretions or ironstone fragments, if present, are few to as much as 15 percent in the upper part of the Bt horizon and as much as 25 percent in the lower part.  Partially weathered, soft to hard greensand and glauconitic materials are at a depth of 5 to 7 feet in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Series in closely related families include the Anniston, Decatur, Greenville, Lucedale, Nacogdoches, Red Bay, Shubuta, and Williamsville soils.  Anniston, Decatur, Greenville, and Nacogdoches soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Lucedale and Red Bay soils have a fine-loamy particle size class.  Shubuta soils have a Bt horizon with a matrix that has color value of more than 3.  Williamsville soils have more than 20 percent decrease in clay from the maximum within 60 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Neshoba soils are on uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  These soils formed in beds of glauconitic marine sediments of Eocene Age.  These are gently sloping to sloping soils with slopes that range from 2 to 8 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 64 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual precipitation is 54 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lucedale and Williamsville soils of the competing series and the Ruston and Smithdale soils.  Ruston and Smithdale soils are fine-loamy in the particle size control section, Lucedale soils mainly are on broader, nearly level parts of the landscape.  Williamsville and Ruston soils are in similar landscape positions as the Neshoba soils.  Smithdale soils mainly are on hillsides in steeper, more dissected terrain."
