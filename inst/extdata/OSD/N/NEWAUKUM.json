  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Newaukum soils are on mountains and foothills at elevations of 300 to l,800 feet.  Slope is 5 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium or glaciofluvial deposits of volcanic ash and rock flour including lahar or mud flow material with a high content of ash and pumice, with an admixture of aerially deposited volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 60 to 75 inches.  Average annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season (32 degrees F.) is l50 to 200 days.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is l50 to 200 days."
