  "OVERVIEW": "The Newaukum series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium or glaciofluvial deposits of volcanic ash and rock flour with an admixture of aerially deposited volcanic ash.  Newaukum soils are on mountains and foothills at elevations of 300 to l,800 feet.  Slope is 5 to 90 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 65 inches and average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
