  "OVERVIEW": "The Niler series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
