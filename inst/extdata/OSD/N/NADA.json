  "OVERVIEW": "The Nada series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1041 mm (41 in).",
