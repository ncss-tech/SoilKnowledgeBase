A subsequent evaluation of soil moisture data show these soils do not have aquic conditions. The classification is changed to Oxyaquic Hapludalfs due to further analysis on a soil moisture study of these soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 19 cm (0 to 7.5 in) (A horizon)\nAbrupt texture change at: 19 cm (7.5 in) (A/Bt contact)\nArgillic horizon: 19 to 203 cm (7.5 to 80 in) (Bt horizons)\nDepth to secondary carbonates: 102 cm (40 in) (Bt5)\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
