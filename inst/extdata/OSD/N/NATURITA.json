  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 5 to 12 inches and is not shallower than the upper 2 inches of the B2t horizon.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 7 to 12 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 7 to 12 inches and such horizons are strong enough to qualify as calcic horizons.  ESP either remains constant or increases with increasing depth ranging from 0 to 15 percent in the solum but exceeds 15 percent in the Cca horizon of some pedons.  A majority of the solum and IIC horizons above a depth of 40 inches have hue of 7.5YR or yellower, but subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum but increase to 35 to 80 percent in the IIC horizon.  They are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is typically loam or clay loam but ranges in clay from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 15 to 55 percent, and sand from 20 to 60 percent with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is very gravelly and cobbly sand or loany sand.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline (1.5 dilution unbuffered organic dye)."

Cornish, Larimer, Vernal, and Wanetta soils lack calcic horizons and have contrasting IIC horizons deeper than 20 inches.  Yoder soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches and lack continuous horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Naturita soils are on nearly level to gently sloping high terraces, mesa tops, and alluvial fans.  Slopes typically range from about 0 to 6 percent or more.  The soils formed in thin medium to moderately fine-textured, calcareous material overlying beds of sand and gravel.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 64 degrees F."
