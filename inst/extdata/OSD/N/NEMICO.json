  "OVERVIEW": "The Nemico series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Nemico soils are on mountains and plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
