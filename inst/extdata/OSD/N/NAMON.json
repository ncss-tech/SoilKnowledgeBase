  "OVERVIEW": "The Namon series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapidly  permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and  shale.  Namon soils are on mountainsides and plateaus and have slopes of 3 to 55 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Colomex soils formed in stratified alluvium and have an abrupt change to sandy textures within 40 inches. Laventana soils have albic horizons. Macmeal, Trapps, and Yourame soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate. Mocmont soils have glossic horizons. Sheek soils are slightly drier and have soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F. Skyview and Wahatoya soils are moderately deep. Sonsela, Tecolote and Towaoc soils are very deep. Vision soils formed in mixed igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary parent material. Xankey soils have lithologic discontinuities of loamy material between 24 and 40 inches and soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F. Ymark soils are deep. Yreka soils have mixed E/Bt horizons. In addition, Macmeal, Mocmont, Skyview, Trapps, Vision, Wahatoya, Ymark, Yourame, and Yreka soils are moist in May and June. ."
