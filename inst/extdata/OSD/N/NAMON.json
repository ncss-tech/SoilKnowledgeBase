Colomex soils formed in stratified alluvium and have an abrupt change to sandy textures within 40 inches. Laventana soils have albic horizons. Macmeal, Trapps, and Yourame soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate. Mocmont soils have glossic horizons. Sheek soils are slightly drier and have soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F. Skyview and Wahatoya soils are moderately deep. Sonsela, Tecolote and Towaoc soils are very deep. Vision soils formed in mixed igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary parent material. Xankey soils have lithologic discontinuities of loamy material between 24 and 40 inches and soil temperatures of 44 to 47 degrees F. Ymark soils are deep. Yreka soils have mixed E/Bt horizons. In addition, Macmeal, Mocmont, Skyview, Trapps, Vision, Wahatoya, Ymark, Yourame, and Yreka soils are moist in May and June. ."

These soils formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F. and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 90 days."
