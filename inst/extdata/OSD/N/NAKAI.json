  "STATES": "AZ,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nakai series consists of deep, and very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium and eolian deposits derived mainly from sandstone and shale. Nakai soils are on river terraces, sand sheets on structural benches, cuestas, fans and broad valleys and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

Kaito soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Kinan and Nuahs soils have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Kinan soils have stratification from 20 to 40 inches. McCutchen soils also have a lithologic discontinuity below 40 inches. Pagina soils have a paralithic contact from 20 to 40 inches. Kaito, Moffat, Boreham, McCutchen, Nuahs, Riemod, and Teabrush soils have a calcic horizon within 20 inches. Boreham, Nakoy, Nolava, Trook, Teabrush, and Riemod have soil temperatures less than 52 degrees F. In addition, Hiko Springs, McCutchen, and Nuahs soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRAs 28A, 28B, 29) and are moist for short periods in winter and early spring and intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September"
