Bluechief soils have bedrock at depths of 30 to 40 inches and a calcic horizon within 25 inches. Boreham, Hiko Springs, McCutchen, Nolava, Riemod, and Trook soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower. Kaito soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Kinan and Nuahs soils have 5 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Kinan soils have stratification from 20 to 40 inches. McCutchen soils also have a lithologic discontinuity below 40 inches. Pagina soils have a paralithic contact from 20 to 40 inches. Kaito, Moffat, Boreham, McCutchen, Nuahs, Riemod, and Teabrush soils have a calcic horizon within 20 inches. Boreham, Nakoy, Nolava, Trook, Teabrush, and Riemod have soil temperatures less than 52 degrees F. In addition, Hiko Springs, McCutchen, and Nuahs soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRAs 28A, 28B, 29) and are moist for short periods in winter and early spring and intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nakai soils are on river terraces, sand sheets on structural benches, fans and broad valleys at elevations of 3,700 to 6,100 feet. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The climate is arid. These soils formed in mixed moderately coarse textured alluvium and eolian material. The mean annual air temperature is about 52 to 57 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 77 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches. Freeze-free period is about 130 to 220 days."
