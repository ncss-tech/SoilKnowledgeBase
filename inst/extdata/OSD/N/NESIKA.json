  "OVERVIEW": "The Nesika series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and volcanic ash.  Nesika soils are on alluvial fans and outwash plains.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.   Mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 50 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but they are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days in most years.  These soils range from strongly acid to slightly acid. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 35 to 60 percent strongly weathered rock fragments.  It is 0 to 20 percent unweathered or partially weathered rock fragments in the profile.\nThe A and AB horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is loam or sandy loam."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium from basic igneous rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is mild, summers are cool and dry, and winters are mild and wet.  Mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches.   Average January temperature is 35 degrees F, average July temperature is 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 125 to 175 days.  The average growing season (28 degrees F) is 150 to 200 days."
