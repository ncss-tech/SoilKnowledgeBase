  "OVERVIEW": "The Northfield series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to a lithic contact with sandstone.  They formed primarily in loamy deposits on uplands.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, depth to the base of soil development, and depth to a lithic contact with sandstone all range from 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the upper part of the soil and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part.  Volume of gravel and channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum.  Volume of cobbles and flagstones, mainly in the lower part of the solum, ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Stones are on the surface in some areas and a stony phase is recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors with value moist of 3 have value dry of 6 or more. Texture of the A or Ap is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is loam or silt loam.  The Bt horizon averages from  15 to 27 percent clay and from 15 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or the channery analogs.\nThe 2R horizon is sandstone bedrock."
