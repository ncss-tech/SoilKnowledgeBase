  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, depth to the base of soil development, and depth to a lithic contact with sandstone all range from 10 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the upper part of the soil and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part.  Volume of gravel and channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum.  Volume of cobbles and flagstones, mainly in the lower part of the solum, ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Stones are on the surface in some areas and a stony phase is recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors with value moist of 3 have value dry of 6 or more. Texture of the A or Ap is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Texture is loam or silt loam.  The Bt horizon averages from  15 to 27 percent clay and from 15 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or the channery analogs.\nThe 2R horizon is sandstone bedrock."

Elkmound soils do not have an argillic horizon. Hixton soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with sandstone."

These soils formed primarily in a thin loamy mantle underlain by platy sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from from 28 to 36 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F."
