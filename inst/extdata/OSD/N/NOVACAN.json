  "OVERVIEW": "The Novacan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks.  Novacan soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
