  "OVERVIEW": "The Norfork series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in loess with a component of volcanic ash and residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, andesite, rhyolite and metamorphic rocks.  Norfork soils are on hill and mountain side slopes and tilted volcanic flows.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is 8 degrees C.",
