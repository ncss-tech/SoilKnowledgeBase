These soils formed in loess with a component of volcanic ash and residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, andesite, rhyolite and metamorphic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,710 to 2,045 meters.  The climate is cool, and semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to l20 days."
