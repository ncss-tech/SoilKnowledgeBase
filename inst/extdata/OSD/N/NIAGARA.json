  "OVERVIEW": "The Niagara series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty glacio-lacustrine deposits. These soils are in level to slightly concave areas on lake plains and in valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 48 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 43 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 50 inches. Rock fragments are generally absent, but can range up to 5 percent by volume. In some pedons that are underlain with till deposits at depths greater than 40 inches, rock fragment content ranges up to 35 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3, and value of 6 or 7 dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Thickness of the Ap horizon ranges from 4 to 10 inches.\nThe E or Eg horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam. The E horizon commonly is massive, or has weak fine subangular blocky, or thin to thick platy structure but the range includes moderate, medium subangular bliocky structure in some pedons. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BE or BA horizon with colors and textures similar to the A, E, and B horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4 with faint to prominent redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam with thin subhorizons of finer or coarser textures in many pedons. Structure is subangular or angular blocky with patchy clay skins on faces of peds. Some pedons have coarse or very coarse prismatic or thick platy structure. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon up to 12 inches thick with colors and texture similar to the B horizon. Reaction  ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y or is neutral, and has value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is dominantly very fine sandy loam, silt loam or silty clay loam, but has stratified layers ranging from fine sand to clay. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons underlain with till have a 2C horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Barcelona series are in the same family. Barcelona soils have bedrock between 40 and 60 inches.\nThe Bromer, Canal, Lauer, Lieber, Taggart, and Tiro series are in closely related families. Bromer soils have a thicker sola. Canal soils have a solum deeper than 40 inches. The Lauer and Lieber soils have the base of the argillic deeper than 40 inches. Taggart soils have the base of the argillic deeper than 40 inches. Tiro soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the subsoil within 40 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Niagara soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils of lake plains. Slopes are mainly less than 5 percent in gradient, but they are as much as 15 percent in a few places. The soils developed in stratified and mostly silty calcareous lacustrine sediments. In some pedons till may be present below 40 inches. The climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F; mean annual precipitation, from 26 to 45 inches; and mean growing season, from 130 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 95 to 1800 feet."

The Arkport, Colonie, Hudson, and Williamson soils, and their less well drained associates, none of which have a fine-silty particle-size control section, are other soils on the same lake plains. Major soils of associated till and glacial outwash plains are the Honeoye, Ontario, Cazenovia, Lansing, Madrid, Palmyra, Alton, and Howard series and their wetter associates."
