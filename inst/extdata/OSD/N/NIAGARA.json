  "OVERVIEW": "The Niagara series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty glacio-lacustrine deposits. These soils are in level to slightly concave areas on lake plains and in valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 8.9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is 940 millimeters.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 50 to 109 centimeters. Depth to bedrock is greater than 150 centimeters. Depth to carbonates ranges from 50 to 125 centimeters. Rock fragments are generally absent, but can range up to 5 percent by volume. In some pedons that are underlain with till deposits at depths greater than 100 centimeters, rock fragment content ranges up to 35 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3, and value of 6 or 7 dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Thickness of the Ap horizon ranges from 10 to 25 centimeters.\nThe E or Eg horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam. The E horizon commonly is massive, or has weak fine subangular blocky, or thin to thick platy structure but the range includes moderate, medium subangular blocky structure in some pedons. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BE or BA horizon with colors and textures similar to the A, E, and B horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4 with faint to prominent redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam with thin subhorizons of finer or coarser textures in many pedons. Structure is subangular or angular blocky with patchy clay skins on faces of peds. Some pedons have coarse or very coarse prismatic or thick platy structure. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon up to 12 inches thick with colors and texture similar to the B horizon. Reaction  ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y or is neutral, and has value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is dominantly very fine sandy loam, silt loam or silty clay loam, but has stratified layers ranging from fine sand to clay. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons underlain with till have a 2C horizon."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Barcelona series are in the same family. Barcelona soils have bedrock between 100 and 150 centimeters.\nThe Bromer, Canal, Lauer, Lieber, Taggart, and Tiro series are in closely related families. Bromer soils have a thicker sola. Canal soils have a solum deeper than 40 inches. The Lauer and Lieber soils have the base of the argillic deeper than 40 inches. Taggart soils have the base of the argillic deeper than 40 inches. Tiro soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the subsoil within 100 centimeters of the soil surface."

Slopes are mainly less than 5 percent in gradient, but they are as much as 15 percent in a few places. The soils developed in stratified and mostly silty calcareous lacustrine sediments. In some pedons till may be present below 100 centimeters. The climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 10.5 degrees C; mean annual precipitation, from 660 to 1145 millimeters; and mean growing season, from 130 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 30 to 550 meters."

The Arkport, Colonie, Hudson, and Williamson soils, and their less well drained associates, none of which have a fine-silty particle-size control section, are other soils on the same lake plains. Major soils of associated till and glacial outwash plains are the Honeoye, Ontario, Cazenovia, Lansing, Madrid, Palmyra, Alton, and Howard series and their wetter associates."
