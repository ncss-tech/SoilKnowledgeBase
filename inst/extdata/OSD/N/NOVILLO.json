  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Novillo series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in sandy eolian sediments on barrier islands.  These nearly level soils are on concave positions in fresh-water swales on barrier flats.  These soils are ponded for very long periods in normal years and are rarely flooded by high storm surge from strong tropical storms.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in).",
