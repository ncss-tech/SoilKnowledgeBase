  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The pedons have a bisequal sola.  The combined sola ranges from 15 to 25 inches in thickness.  The loess mantle ranges from 20 to 30 inches in thickness over sand or very gravelly sand.  The sola is usually formed entirely in the eolian mantle, but in some pedons extends into the underlying material.  The exchange complex of the sola is dominated by amorphous material.  The upper 4 inches of the spodic horizons has less than 6 percent organic carbon.  In many pedons, the upper horizons are churned and mixed due to treethrow and/or frost action.  Reaction in the solum is extremely acid to strongly acid and in the substratum is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR; and value and chroma moist of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nTexture of the Bhs and Bs horizons is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The Bhs horizon has hue ranging from 2.5YR to 7.5YR; value moist from 3 to 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 4.  Weakly cemented fragments and concretions are often present.  The Bs horizon has hue ranging from 5YR to 10YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 3 to 8.\nThe buried solum is usually similar to the surface solum in color and texture.  However, in pedons where the lower solum extends into the underlying material, the hue ranges to 2.5Y, and the texture ranges to sand or very gravelly sand.\nThe 2C horizon is variegated, but with a dominant hue from 10YR to 2.5Y.   Texture ranges from sand to very gravelly sand.  Some pedons contain a few brownish streaks from broken strata of weakly cemented fine sand."

Chulitna soils have a loess mantle thicker than 30 inches.  Homestead and Kashwitna soils have a loess mantle less than 20 inches thick.  Lucile soils are mottled and are poorly drained.  Shoestring soils contain coarse fragments of volcanic ash.  Soldotna soils are not bisequal."

The soils formed in ash-influenced loess overlying a friable, sandy or gravelly substratum.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 32 to 36 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 32 inches."
