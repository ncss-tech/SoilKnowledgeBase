  "OVERVIEW": "The Nakochna series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in a mantle of ash influenced loess overlying granite bedrock. Nakochna soils are on mountain ridges and side slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 85 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 32 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 14 to 20 inches. The solum ranges in thickness from 12 to 20 inches. Buried horizons are present in some pedons. The exchange complex of the solum is dominated by amorphous material. The upper 6 inches of the spodic horizons have more than 6 percent organic carbon. Frost action has churned and mixed the horizons. Coarse fragment content increases with depth in the profile. Total coarse fragment content in the control section is less than 35 percent with 5 to 10 percent cobbles and 5 to 25 percent gravel. Thin ash layers (1/4 to 1 inch thick) occur in the upper part of some pedons. Reaction throughout the profile is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. This horizon is not evident in many horizons due to frost churning.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue from 2.5YR to 7.5YR value from 3 to 5, and chroma 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nC Texture is silt loam or gravelly silt loam."
