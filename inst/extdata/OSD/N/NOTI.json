Depth to the very gravelly horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly is fine sandy loam but ranges to loam and is 10 to 18 percent clay.  Mottles are distinct or prominent.\nThe 2C horizon is 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe 3C horizon is very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sandy loam, and is 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments.
