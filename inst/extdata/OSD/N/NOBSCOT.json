  "OVERVIEW": "The Nobscot series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in wind-modified loamy and sandy sediments of Pleistocene age. These soils occur on undulating to hilly stream terraces of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B, 78C). Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in).",
