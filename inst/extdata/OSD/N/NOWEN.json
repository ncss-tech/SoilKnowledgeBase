  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates commonly is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology are dispersed throughout the solum and C horizon and range from 2 to 15 percent by volume.  Mineralogy of the fine earth fraction is mixed.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  The A horizons and B2 horizons are slightly or moderately acid.  The Ap horizons that have been limed are slightly acid or neutral.  The B3 horizon is slightly acid to neutral.\nNoncultivated pedons have an A horizon that is 3 to 5 inches thick and that has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  They have a weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe E horizons have a matrix with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has redoximorphic features.  It has a weak or moderate platy structure.  Typically it is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, but loamy sand and loamy fine sand are included in the range.\nThe Btg horizons have a matrix with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam averaging between 10 and 18 percent clay.  Thin discontinuous strata of irregular shaped inclusions of loamy sands, loam or sandy clay loam or both are in this horizon of some pedons.  The middle part of the Btg horizons have weak prismatic structure parting to weak or moderate subangular or angular blocky structure. Thin patchy clay films are few or common and primarily are on vertical faces of peds.  Thin to medium, porous, bleached sandy coatings commonly are on faces of prisms.\nThe Bg horizon has a matrix hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has redoximorphic features.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, but thin strata or inclusions with redder hue or both are in the range.  It is dominantly sandy loam but thin strata or inclusions of finer or coarser textures or both are in the range.  It is friable or firm.  The C horizon is neutral or slightly acid in the upper part and becomes slightly alkaline with depth."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 9 inches (Ap horizon); albic horizon - the zone from 9 to 15 inches (Eg horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 15 to 42 inches (Btg horizons); aquic soil moisture conditions; mollic subgroup.  The surface layer qualifies for a mollic epipedon except for thickness.  An initial review draft of this series (LMC-HRF, February, 1972) was circulated with the name Nowthen.\nClassification was changed 5/94 from the Mollic Ochraqualfs subgroups.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer To MAES Central File Code No. 1341 for results of some laboratory analysis of the typical pedon.  Soil Interpretation Record number is MN0201.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
