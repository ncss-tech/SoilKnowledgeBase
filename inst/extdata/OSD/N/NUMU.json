  "OVERVIEW": "The Numu series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources, and lacustrine sediments.  Numu soils are on stream and lacustrine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 130 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
