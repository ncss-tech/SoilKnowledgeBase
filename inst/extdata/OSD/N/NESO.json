  "OVERVIEW": "The Neso series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained soils that developed in deposits of alluvial and eolian sediments.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  These soils are on plains, mesas, and ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about l3 inches and mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

Paisano and Sutherland soils have mean annual soil temperature greater than 62 but less than 70 degrees F.  Philder soils are greater than 14 inches deep to a petrocalcic horizon.  Sequite, Tencee, and Wechech soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods (typic/aridic) and support a distinctively different vegetative community."
