Paisano and Sutherland soils have mean annual soil temperature greater than 62 but less than 70 degrees F.  Philder soils are greater than 14 inches deep to a petrocalcic horizon.  Sequite, Tencee, and Wechech soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods (typic/aridic) and support a distinctively different vegetative community."

Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches, of which more than one-half occurs in the summer months during severe thunderstorms.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 60 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 180 to 200 days and elevation ranges from 4,200 to 5,300 feet"
