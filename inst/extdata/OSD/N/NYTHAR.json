  "REVDATE": "01/2008",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nythar series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on glacial outwash plains, stream terraces, drainageways, alluvial fans and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
