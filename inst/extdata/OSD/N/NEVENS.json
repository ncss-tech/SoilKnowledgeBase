Rock fragment content averages less than 35 percent, by volume, in the series control section.\nSome pedons may have a thin O horizon (duff layer).\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is stony loam, stony fine sandy loam, stony sandy loam, or their non-stony, gravelly or cobbly analogues. Rock fragment content by volume ranges from 2 to 30 percent with 2 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones and boulders. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon but this occurs in less than 50 percent of all pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or their stony, cobbly or gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content by volume ranges from 2 to 30 percent with 2 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent stones and boulders. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon with chroma of 2.\nSome pedons have a BC, 2Bw or 2BC horizon.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is gravelly sandy loam, gravelly coarse sandy loam, gravelly loamy coarse sand, gravelly loamy sand or their very gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content by volume ranges from 15 to 45 percent with 15 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 2 percent stones and boulders. The 1/3 bar bulk density of the fine earth fraction is from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cm3. It is moderately acid to neutral."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cable, Canosia and Mishwabic(T) series.  The Cable soils have a 3Cd horizon typically comprised of sandy dense till.  The Canosia soils formed in Superior Lobe till with substratum colors having hue of 2.5YR and 5YR. Mishwabic soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 51 to 102 centimeters."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nevens soils are on nearly level summits, flats and footslopes on drumlins and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in a loamy mantle and the underlying dense loamy basal Rainy Lobe till of Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 790 mm. Annual frost free days range from 90 to 120 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 200 to 600 meters."

The somewhat poorly drained Brimson soils are on plane to slightly convex slopes and are typically higher lying on the landscape.  The very poorly drained Bugcreek soils are in drainageways and depressions and typically have more stones in and on the surface. The moderately well drained Toimi soils are convex and are higher lying on the landscape."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 1.41 to 14.11 micrometers per second (0.20 to 2.0 inches per hour) in the upper part and .01 to .42 micrometers per second (0.0015 to 0.06 inches per hour) in the lower part.  Nevens soils have perched saturation as high as the surface during spring in normal years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 13 cm below the surface (A horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from 13 cm to 109 cm (Bw horizons). Aquic suborder based on a presumed positive test with alpha,alpha dipyridyl in normal year and field monitoring of actual conditions over time.  The nature of this parent material is to not show reduced colors even though saturated for prolonged periods of time.  Studies are underway as to the reason for this situation; isotic mineralogy based on lab data.\nThe designation of the 2BCd horizon is based on fractures and platy structure in the densic material.  Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to NSSL pedon number S95-MN137-542 for additional analysis.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
