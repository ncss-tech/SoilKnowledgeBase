    "content": "TYPICAL PEDON:  Norgo silt loam - on a 4 percent convex slope in a cultivated field at an elevation of about 1,165 feet.  (Colors are for moist soil unless otherwise stated.)\nAp--0 to 6 inches; very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) silt loam, pale brown (10YR 6/3) dry; moderate fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine fibrous roots; moderately acid; clear wavy boundary.  (5 to 9 inches thick)\nBt1--6 to 11 inches; brown (10YR 4/3) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common fine fibrous roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; clear wavy boundary.\nBt2--11 to 17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3) silt loam; moderate medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; few faint clay films on faces of peds; strongly acid; abrupt smooth boundary.  (Combined thickness of the Bt horizons ranges from 5 to 11 inches.)\n2R--17 inches; brown (10YR 5/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine-grained sandstone in plates 15 to 50 mm thick, with thin lenses of dark brown (7.5YR 4/4) loam between the plates at depths above 30 inches."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to the lithic contact with sandstone ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Clay content averages 10 to 20 percent in the particle-size control section and content of fine sand or coarser is more than 15 percent. Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil. Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the soil but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where moist value is 3, dry value is 6 or more.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the Ap or A horizon is silt loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt or 2BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe 2R horizon has color like the 2B horizon described above. It is sandstone that is generally platy in the upper part and less so with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in loamy deposits underlain by sandstone.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Near the generalized mesic-frigid line, Norgo soils are associated with the Eleva, Elkmound, and Gale soils that are classified mesic.  Gale and Eleva soils occupy areas marginal to Norgo soils where thickness of the soil material over bedrock ranges between 20 and 40 inches.  Elkmound soils occupy topographic positions similar to those of Norgo soils."
