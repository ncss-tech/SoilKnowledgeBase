  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the 0 horizon ranges from 14 to 16 inches and usually contains several thin layers of volcanic ash.  The organic material is primarily coarse moss and sedge, but in places finely divided peat occurs in the lower layers. Ice lenses usually occur within 4 inches of the mineral surface but may occur in the lower part of the 0 horizon. The A horizon is usually silt loam or loam, but ranges to mucky silt loam and sandy loam. The C horizon is usually loam, but may be sandy loam or sandy clay loam. The A horizons are in hue 5YR or 7.5YR, with values of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2. The C horizons range from 5Y to 5GY with values of 4 or 5 and chromas of 1 or 2."

The Goldstream soils are fairly high in mica and have thin A horizons. The Kuskokwim soils have thin A horizons and mottled C horizons. The Medfra soils have high chromas in the C horizon. The Owhat soils lack mottles in the A horizon and have brown patches in the C horizon. The Lemeta soils are deep peats."
