  "REVDATE": "06/2002",
  "STATES": "NE,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Niobrara series consists of shallow, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on hills, ridges, valley sides and interfluves.  They formed in sandy residuum weathered from sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches at the type location.",

Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture typically is loamy fine sand with the range including fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  Sandstone gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y value of 5 to 8 dry and 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  Sandstone gravel ranges from 5 to 15 percent by volume.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is sandstone bedrock.  It is generally calcareous."
