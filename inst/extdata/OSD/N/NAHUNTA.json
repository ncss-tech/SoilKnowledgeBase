    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Loamy textures extend from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to hard rock is greater than 20 feet.  The soil is strongly acid through extremely acid, except where limed.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, chroma of 1 or 2.  The A horizon is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 2 to 4.  The E horizon is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BA or BE horizons, where present, have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 0r 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. They are very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  There are few to many mottles of chroma 2 or less. The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 0 to 2.  There are common to many mottles in shades of red through yellow.  The Bt and Btg horizons are clay loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  The upper 20 inches of this horizon contains more than 30 percent silt, and the sand fraction is dominantly very fine.  Some pedons have a few brown to red concretions.\nThe BCg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 or 2.  Mottles are in shades of brown, red, or yellow.  It is clay loam , silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2, or it is mottled in shades of brown, red, yellow, or gray.  It is variable in texture, consisting of typically consisting of layers of loamy or clayey sediments of variable thickness."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: (This section not checked this date; added activity class)  Tomast series is the only series in the same family.  Augusta, Dunbar, Exum, Grantham, Lenoir, Lynchburg, Summerfield, and Trebloc series are in closely related families. Augusta and Lynchburg soils have less than 30 percent silt and more medium sand in the argillic horizons.  Dunbar and Lenoir soils have Bt horizons that contain more than 35 percent clay. Exum soils have better drainage.  Grantham and Trebloc soils have poorer drainage.  Summerfield soils are bisequal and have clayey 2B horizons.  Tomast soils have hues redder than the 10YR in the Bt horizons."
