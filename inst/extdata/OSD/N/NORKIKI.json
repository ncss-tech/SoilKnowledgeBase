  "OVERVIEW": "The Norkiki series consists of moderately deep to sandstone bedrock, well drained, moderately permeable soils that developed in eolian and alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Norkiki soils are on mesas, cuestas, hills and ridges. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
