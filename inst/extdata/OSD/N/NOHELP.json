  "OVERVIEW": "The Nohelp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian volcanic ash over alluvium derived from volcanic and metavolcanic rocks.  Nohelp soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",

They formed in eolian volcanic ash over alluvium derived from volcanic and metavolcanic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,895 to 2,380 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 410 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4.4 to 6.7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."

Volcanic glass and oxalate aluminum and iron contents are estimated."
