    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nayped soils are on alluvial fans. Elevations are 1,800 to 1,890 meters.  Slope are 0 to 4 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks including limestone, sandstone, shale, dolomite and conglomerate.  They have significant amounts of volcanic ash.  The climate is cool, semiarid with mean annual precipitation of 200 to 250 mm that comes mostly as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost free season is 50 to 80 days."

Alhambra and Bruffy soils lack cambic horizons and have irregularly decreasing organic matter with depth.  Holtle soils have mollic epipedons. Kobeh soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections."
