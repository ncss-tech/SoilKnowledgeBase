  "OVERVIEW": "The Nayped series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks including limestone, sandstone, shale, dolomite and conglomerate. Nayped soils are on alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
