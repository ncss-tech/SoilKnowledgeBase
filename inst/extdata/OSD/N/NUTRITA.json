  "OVERVIEW": "The Nutrita series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Nutrita soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 41 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C.",
