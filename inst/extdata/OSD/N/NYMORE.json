  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 24 to 45 inches, and depth to free carbonates ranges from 4 to 10 feet or more. These soils typically do not have gravel, but in some pedons gravel of mixed lithology and commonly less than 10 mm in size comprises as much as 10 percent of the solum and C horizon, either as distinct strata or dispersed throughout the matrix.  These soils have 10 to 40 percent dark colored minerals of the sand size fraction or larger.  The series control section averages 10 to 20 percent coarse sand and very coarse sand, 35 to 50 percent medium sand, and 20 to 40 percent fine sand and very fine sand.  The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 (less than 6 when dry), and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand, coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR in the upper part, and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has in the lower part hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand or loamy sand.  Also, it has thin subhorizons of fine sand or loamy fine sand in some pedons.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It has mottles below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  It dominantly is coarse sand or sand, but it has thin strata of fine sand in some pedons.  It is strongly acid through slightly alkaline."

Champlain soils have less than 30 percent medium sand or coarser in the series control section. Claire soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for more than 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Corliss soils have carbonates within 40 inches.  Friendship soils have high chroma mottles within a depth of 40 inches and are moderately well drained.  Grayling soils have more than 50 percent medium sand. Mahtomedi soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the series control section.  Menahga soils have more than 20 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the series control section.  Omega soils have more than 40 percent dark colored minerals in the sand size fraction or larger and has hue of 5YR or redder throughout the series control section and deeper.  Pelkie soils do not have gravel size fragments in the series control section and have less than 10 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  Plainbo soils have a lithic contact between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Sartell, Serden, and Shawano soils have more than 40 percent fine sands throughout the series control section.  Sunday soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 consecutive days during the summer solstice."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Nymore soils have slightly concave through convex slopes on outwash plains and valley trains.  Slope gradients typically range from 1 to 12 percent with an extreme range of  0 to 25 percent.  Slopes are simple or complex and plain or convex.  The Nymore soils formed in sandy glacial outwash sediments of mixed lithology of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 36 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation from about 22 to 33 inches. Frost-free days range from 88 to 142.  Elevation ranges from 670 to 1600 feet."

The poorly and very poorly drained Isan soils are on nearby lower lying nearly level landscapes.  Duelm and Isan soils have mollic epipedons."
