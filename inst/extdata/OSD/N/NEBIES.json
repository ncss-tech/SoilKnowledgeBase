  "REVDATE": "06/2005",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nebies series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium or gravelly till derived from igneous and/or metamorphic rock. These soils are on moraines, stream terraces, knobs or hills in intermountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
