  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Natkim soils are on mountain side slopes, and U-shaped glacial valleys. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. These soils formed in mixed loose glacial till with andesite and basalt colluvium mixed with volcanic ash. Elevation is 2,200 to 4,400 feet. These soils are in a continental climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 44 to 45 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 145 to 170 days."
