  "OVERVIEW": "The Nippt series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
