Soils have an aridic moisture regime that boarders on ustic.\nSoil temperature - 53 to 58 degrees F.\nDepth to contrasting fragmental material - 5 to 10 inches.\nDepth to lithic contact - 14 to 20 inches.\nOther features - Contrasting layer: Bt horizon has 35 percent or more fine earth by volume than the 2C horizon.\nControl section - Percent clay: 20 to 35 percent in the upper part.\nRock fragments: Average 35 to 60 percent in the upper part; 90 to 100 percent in the contrasting lower part. Rock fragments are mainly gravel derived from metamorphosed granitic rocks.\nA horizon - Value: 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 3 or 4.\nBt horizon - Value: 3 or 4 moist.\nTexture: Sandy clay loam, loam or clay loam.\nClay content: 20 to 35 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 60 percent mainly gravel.\nStructure: Subangular blocky or angular blocky.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\n2C horizon - Texture: gravel\nStructure - retains structure of original rock that has fractured and weathered in place. 95 percent fine angular gravel."
