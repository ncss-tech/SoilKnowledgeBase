Behanin and Marcetta soils have an E horizon. Belsac, Croesus, Namela, Nevtah, and Nagitsy soils are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock. Belsac, Gateview, Hapgood, Harcany, and Lolon soils lack Bw horizons. Belsac, Caballo, Hobacker, Lionhead, and Mundos soils have secondary carbonates. Bullrey, Poleline, and Povey soils lack an O horizon.  Papaspila soils have more than 35 percent andesite, diorite, rhyolite, tuff, basalt, and breccia fragments in the particle-size control section. Parkcity soils have more than 35 percent limestone, quartzite and sandstone fragments in the particle-size control section. Snag soils have a pH of 5.5 to 6.2 throughout and have a summer soil temperature of 60 to 62 degrees F. Snopoc soils are dominated by coarse sand fraction in the textural control section and have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the control section. Tonigut soils have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the particle-size control  section and a paralithic contact within 60 inches of the mineral soil surface. Warshod soils have a xeric moisture regime and a paralithic contact within 60 inches of the mineral soil surface."
