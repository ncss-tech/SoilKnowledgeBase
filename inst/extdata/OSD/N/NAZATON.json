  "OVERVIEW": "The Nazaton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and material weathered from granitic rocks. They are on backslopes of mountains and canyons. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slopes are 20 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
