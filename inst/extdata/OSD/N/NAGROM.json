  "OVERVIEW": "The Nagrom series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over residuum and colluvium from extrusive igneous rocks.  Nagrom soils are on ridge crests and mountain sideslopes at elevations of 2,400 to 3,600 feet.  Slopes are 8 to 90 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 85 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F.  Pedons range from weakly smeary to moderately smeary throughout.\nThe E horizon is weakly expressed or lacking in some pedons.  It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It contains 0 to 15 percent hard cinders and pebbles.  There is tonguing of the E horizon into the B horizon in some pedons.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is sandy loam, loam, gravelly sandy loam,or gravelly loam (volcanic ash and pumice) and contains 0 to 30 percent pebbles and hard cinders.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, or gravelly loam with 10 to 35 percent pebbles and hard cinders.  It is very strongly acid, strongly acid, or moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.

Mean January temperature is 27 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 60 degrees F, the mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.
