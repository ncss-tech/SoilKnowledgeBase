Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F and mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F.  Pedons range from weakly smeary to moderately smeary throughout.\nThe E horizon is weakly expressed or lacking in some pedons.  It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It contains 0 to 15 percent hard cinders and pebbles.  There is tonguing of the E horizon into the B horizon in some pedons.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is sandy loam, loam, gravelly sandy loam,or gravelly loam (volcanic ash and pumice) and contains 0 to 30 percent pebbles and hard cinders.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, or gravelly loam with 10 to 35 percent pebbles and hard cinders.  It is very strongly acid, strongly acid, or moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, or very gravelly loam.  It contains 25 to 50 percent pebbles and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.

They formed in residuum and colluvium from andesite, basalt and breccia with volcanic ash and pumice in the upper part.  Mean January temperature is 27 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 60 degrees F, the mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 75 to 100 inches, with the majority as snow in the winter months.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."

Foss soils are medial over loamy-skeletal.  Haywire soils have more than 6 percent organic carbon throughout the upper 12 inches of the spodic horizon.  Kindy soils have a paralithic contact with dense compact glacial till at 20 to 40 inches.  Littlejohn and Pitcher soils are frigid.  Spukwush soils are a shy over loamy.  Nimue soils are deep."
