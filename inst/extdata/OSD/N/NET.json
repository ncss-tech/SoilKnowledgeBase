  "OVERVIEW": "The Net series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in modified loamy eolian material and in the underlying gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sandy loam glacial till on ground moraines and end moraines. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan, very slow in the fragipan, and moderately rapid or moderate below the fragipan. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The solum ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid and the 2C horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon, 5 to 35 percent in the E, Bhs, and Bs horizons and 15 to 35 percent throughout the remainder of the pedon. Cobbles and stones range from 0 to 20 percent above the fragipan and 0 to 10 percent in the remainder of the pedon. The particle-size control section averages less than 35 percent rock fragments. Typically stones cover from .01 to 3.0 percent of the surface.\nSome pedons have an O horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly and cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe Bhs and Bs horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. The 2Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The Bs and 2Bs horizons are very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly and cobbly analogs of these textures.\nThe 2Bx horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 4. Pedons that do not have 2Bx horizons, have 2E/Bx and/or 2B/Ex horizons. The E part has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very fine sandy loam or loamy sand. The B part has colors similar to the Bx horizon. It is very fine sandy loam, sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. The 2B and 2C horizons are gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam."
