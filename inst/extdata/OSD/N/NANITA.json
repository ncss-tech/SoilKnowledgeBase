  "OVERVIEW": "The Nanita series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Nanita soils are on moraines and glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
