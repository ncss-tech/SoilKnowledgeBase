  "OVERVIEW": "The Needle Peak series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Needle Peak soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, drainage channels, stream terraces and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
