  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Needle Peak soils are on inset fans, drainage channels, low fan skirts, stream terraces, and flood plains. These soils formed in alluvium and lake sediments derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,739 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 180 to 230 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost- free season is 100 to 130 days."

Dun Glen soils are coarse-loamy. Ocala soils have layers of high sodium concentration. Raglan soils are fine- loamy and have horizons with 20 to 80 percent durinodes."
