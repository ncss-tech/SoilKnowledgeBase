  "OVERVIEW": "The Nodman series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium, alluvium, or residuum from granite.  Nodman soils are on pediments, hills, and mountains and have slopes of 2 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 2 to 10 inches (Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 10 inches (2Cr1 horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2003.\nThe classification of this series was changed and the type location moved in July, 2004.  Formerly, Nodman was classified as a Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Haplargids.  The changes were facilitated by increased acreage and a better understanding of the soil moisture regimes in the area."
