    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 2 to 10 inches (Bt horizon)\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 10 inches (2Cr1 horizon)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2003.\nThe classification of this series was changed and the type location moved in July, 2004.  Formerly, Nodman was classified as a Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, thermic, shallow Typic Haplargids.  The changes were facilitated by increased acreage and a better understanding of the soil moisture regimes in the area.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
