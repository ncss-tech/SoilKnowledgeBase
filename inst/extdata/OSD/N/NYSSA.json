  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry but are moist for more than 60 days during the winter season.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The A and B horizons above the duripan are slightly to moderately alkaline and commonly noncalcareous but some pedons are weakly calcareous in the B horizon.  The A and B horizons above the duripan are silt loam or very fine sandy loam and have less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bw and Bkq horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist.  It has weak prismatic or subangular blocky structure.\nThe duripan is indurated in some part and the remaining part ranges from weakly to strongly cemented.  It is massive or platy."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burke, Dolman, Minidoka, and Sluka series.  Burke soils are calcareous below depth of 6 inches and lack durinodes above the duripan. Dolman soils have a calcic horizon.  Minidoka soils have Bk (calcic) horizons at depths of 7 to 16 inches. Stanfield soils have high exchangeable sodium, are somewhat poorly drained and very strongly alkaline in some part above the duripan.  Sluka soils have a calcic horizon."

The soils formed in lacustrine materials with the surface reworked by wind.  The climate is semiarid and has hot dry summers and cold winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F., and the mean winter temperature is 31 to 33 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 150 to 170 days."
