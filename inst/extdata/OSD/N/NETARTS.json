The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. under canopy cover.  Soil color is commonly mixed or variegated below the A horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and dry, and chroma or 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is loose or very friable. Texture is fine sandy loam, fine sand or loamy fine sand with 1 to 8 percent clay.  The A horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand with 1 to 5 percent clay.\nThe Abs horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand with 1 to 5 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent very weakly to weakly iron-cemented nodules.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 8 moist and dry.  The iron-rich material ranges from thin stratified layers to thick massive layers that are very weakly to weakly cemented.  It has 0 to 40 percent very weakly through moderately iron-cemented nodules and fragments. Intermittent moderately iron-cemented lenses are in some pedons.  The very weakly to weakly cemented iron-rich material is absent in some pedons.  Texture is loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand with 1 to 5 percent clay. It is single grain or massive. The organic matter is estimated to be less than 2 percent in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand or sand with 1 to 5 percent clay.  It has 0 to 30 percent very weakly to moderately iron-cemented nodules and fragments and has intermittent very weakly to weakly iron-cemented lenses.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Texture is fine sand or sand with 1 to 5 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent very weakly to weakly iron-cemented nodules.

Nelscott soils have an umbric epipedon, are moderately fine textured and are on adjacent marine terraces. Warrenton soils are poorly drained, have an umbric epipedon and are on slightly younger interdune swales and low areas. Waldport soils are on recently stabilized sand dunes and lack a B horizon.
