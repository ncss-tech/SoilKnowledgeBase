Iron or iron and manganese concretions range from none to common.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid, except where surface layers have been limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N and value of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with or without the mucky modifier.\nThe AC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N and value of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with or without the mucky modifier.   Iron or clay depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive.\nThe upper Cg horizon, to a depth of about 40 to 50 inches, has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N and value of 4 or 5.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam, and less commonly loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Iron or clay depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive.\nThe lower Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or hue of N and value of 4 to 7.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons are stratified with lenses or strata ranging from sandy clay loam to sand.  Iron or clay depletions are in shades of gray and iron accumulations are in shades of red, brown, yellow, or olive."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Series in closely related families include Bibb, Ballahack, Johnston, Murville, Pamlico, Pocomoke, Rutlege, Torhunta, and Toxaway soils.  Ballahack and Toxaway soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Bibb soils do not have an umbric epipedon.  Johnston soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Murville, Pamlico, and Rutlege soils are in a sandy particle-size class.  Pocomoke and Torhunta soils have an umbric epipedon less than 24 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Newholland soils are on broad upland flats and along the outer edges of pocosins or on flood plains in the Lower Coastal Plain.  These soils formed in loamy marine and fluvial sediments.  Elevation is less than 25 feet.  Slopes are 2 percent or less.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from 215 to 250 days, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches."

A few areas have been cleared and drained and are used for growing corn, soybeans, and pasture.  Understory species include waxmyrtle, sweetbay, redbay, switch cane, giant cane, blueberry, and southern bayberry."
