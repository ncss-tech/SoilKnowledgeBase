  "OVERVIEW": "The Newholland series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils with moderately rapid and rapid permeability.  These soils formed in loamy marine and fluvial sediments.  They are on broad upland flats and along the outer edges of pocosins or on flood plains in the Lower Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. near the type location.",

Series in closely related families include Bibb, Ballahack, Johnston, Murville, Pamlico, Pocomoke, Rutlege, Torhunta, and Toxaway soils.  Ballahack and Toxaway soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Bibb soils do not have an umbric epipedon.  Johnston soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Murville, Pamlico, and Rutlege soils are in a sandy particle-size class.  Pocomoke and Torhunta soils have an umbric epipedon less than 24 inches thick."
