(6 to 12 inches thick)\nC1ca--9 to 30 inches; light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4) fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; massive; hard, very friable; visible secondary calcium carbonate occurring as concretions and in thin seams and streaks; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); gradual wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are typically calcareous throughout but are leached for a few inches in some pedons.  Depths to the soft sandstone and interbedded loamstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon of the upper 15 inches is approximately 5 percent and the sand/clay ratio typically ranges from 5 to 8.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 58 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 65 to 75 degrees F.  Rock fragments are typically less than 10 percent and range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  When the value of the surface horizon is as dark as 5 dry and 3 moist the horizon is too thin to be mollic.  Typically, the A horizon has fine granular structure but it may have weak subangular blocky structure when tilled.  It is soft to slightly hard.  This horizon is mildly to strongly alkaline (pH 7.8 to 8.6).\nThe C1ca horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, dependent upon the lithochromic coloration of bedrock itself.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to pH 8.6) and has approximately 1 to 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on gently to moderately sloping upland hills and ridges.  Slope gradients range from about 2 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse textured calcareous parent materials weathered residually from underlying sedimentary bedrock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is approximately 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and early summer months.  The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 70 degrees F."
