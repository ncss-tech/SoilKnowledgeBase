  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F. The soil is usually moist but is dry in all parts of the soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The depth to bedrock and thickness of the solum is 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section has 40 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam with 15 to 40 percent clay. It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 0 to 3 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe BA or AB horizon, when present, has hue of  7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam, clay or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 0 to 3 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry. Texture is silty clay or clay with 40 to 50 percent clay. It has 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 20 percent gravel with a weighted average of less than 35 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bellpine, Gelderman, Tullycreek (T), and Windygap series. Bellpine soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and have sedimentary pararock fragments throughout. Gelderman soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and have basalt pararock fragments throughout.  Tullycreek soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock and are dry for more than 60 consecutive days in the summer.  Windygap soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nekia soils are on foothills with well rounded hills and abrupt steep breaks with all exposures at elevations from 250 to 1,400 feet. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt and tuffaceous materials. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches. The average annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The average January temperature is 39 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 225 days."

The Cottrell soils have redox depletions in the upper part of the the argillic horizon and occur on concave positions. Jory soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock and occur on linear and concave parts of hillslopes. Ritner soils are clayey-skeletal and occur on convex parts of hillslopes. Saum soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock and are on hillslopes. Witzel soils are 12 to 20 inches to bedrock and occur on convex parts of hillslopes."
