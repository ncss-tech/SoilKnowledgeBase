  "OVERVIEW": "The Needleton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stony and cobbly slope alluvium and colluvium  derived from rhyolite, sandstone, limestone, and shale.  Needleton soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",

(E horizon)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 16 to 62 inches.  (B/E and Bt horizons)\nParticle size control section:  The zone from 16 to 36 inches (B/E and part of the Bt1 horizons)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to Eighth Edition, 1998\nActivity class is presumed from the general trend of other soils in the area. Placement in the Eutric subgroup is based on a limited amount of lab data; pedons that are very strongly acid may have base saturation less than 50 percent in some part, hence in the Typic subgroup. This aspect of the series needs further study.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
