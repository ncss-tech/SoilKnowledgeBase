These soils are in a mild marine climate with a mean annual precipitation of 1,000 to 1,050 mm most of which falls as rain in November through April. The mean January temperature is about 2 degrees C.; the mean July temperature is about 18 degrees C.; the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 150 to 180 days."

Norma soils have an aquic moisture regime and are in depressions on glacial till plains and drainageways. Spanaway soils are sandy-skeletal and are on terraces and plains."
