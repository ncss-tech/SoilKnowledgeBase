    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nisqually soils are on terraces at elevations 15 to 122 meters. The soils formed in glacial outwash with slopes of 0 to 15 percent. These soils are in a mild marine climate with a mean annual precipitation of 1,000 to 1,050 mm most of which falls as rain in November through April. The mean January temperature is about 2 degrees C.; the mean July temperature is about 18 degrees C.; the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 150 to 180 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Indianola, Norma, and Spanaway soils. Indianola soils lack an umbric epipedon and are on hills, terrace escarpments, eskers and kames. Norma soils have an aquic moisture regime and are in depressions on glacial till plains and drainageways. Spanaway soils are sandy-skeletal and are on terraces and plains."
