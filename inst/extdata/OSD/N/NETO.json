  "OVERVIEW": "The Neto series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on stream bottoms and alluvial fans.  They formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 to 57 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 90 cumulative days or more in 7 out 10 years in some subhorizons between depths of 8 and 24 inches but are not continuously dry in all parts between these depths for as long as 60 consecutive days.  These soils are slightly calcareous to very strongly calcareous in the A and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is stratified loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, silt loam, silty clay loam, and gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy sand and averages less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section."

These soils formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone, limestone, and shale.  The average annual precipitation is 13 to 20 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 100 days.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as Alluvial soils.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 2 inches.  (A horizon)\nFluvent feature - an irregular decrease in organic matter.\nUstic feature - dry in some or all parts of the moisture control section for 90 or more days cumulative, but not dry in all parts more than half the time that the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
