  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nuxmaruhanixete series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty alluvium and in loamy alluvium and in the underlying sandy outwash.  These soils are on strath terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the silty alluvium, moderate or moderately slow in the loamy alluvium, and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Knox and John W. Attig explains the sediments found over a rock bench.  It is thought to be a pre-Illinoian sediment with an eastward-sloping depositional surface.  This was laid down when the flow of the Wisconsin River was to the east as a result from an ice blockage along the Mississippi River.\nADDITIONAL DATA: None available\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
