Knox and John W. Attig explains the sediments found over a rock bench.  It is thought to be a pre-Illinoian sediment with an eastward-sloping depositional surface.  This was laid down when the flow of the Wisconsin River was to the east as a result from an ice blockage along the Mississippi River.\nADDITIONAL DATA: None available\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
