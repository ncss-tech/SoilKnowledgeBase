Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent (by volume) in the upper loamy mantle and 5 to 50 percent in the underlying material with some strata ranging to 65 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3. Value is less than 5.5 when dry. It is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B/E horizon has interfingers with width of less than 15 millimeters. The color of the B part has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The E part has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam or loam. The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6. It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. Thin lamellae are present in this horizon in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a thin 2Bw horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6. It is sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Novak soils are on plain to convex positions on glacial outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 6 percent, but range from 0 to 18 percent. Novak soils formed in a loamy mantle over Superior Lobe sandy and gravelly outwash sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 47 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 24 to 33 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ogilvie and Warman soils. In places they are associated with the well drained St. Francis (T) soil. The somewhat poorly drained Ogilvie soil is on plane slopes, the Warman soils are in concave swales and depressions. The St. Francis soil is on similar landscape positions as Novak."
