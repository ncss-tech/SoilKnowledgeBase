  "OVERVIEW": "The Novak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a loamy mantle overlying sandy and gravelly sediments on outwash plains and stream terraces.  The permeability is moderate in the upper mantle and rapid or very rapid in the underlying material. Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent (by volume) in the upper loamy mantle and 5 to 50 percent in the underlying material with some strata ranging to 65 percent. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3. Value is less than 5.5 when dry. It is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B/E horizon has interfingers with width of less than 15 millimeters. The color of the B part has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The E part has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.

The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR; value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6. It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues.
