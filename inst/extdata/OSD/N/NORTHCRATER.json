  "OVERVIEW": "The Northcrater series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic tephra. Northcrater soils are on cinder cones, and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent. The permeability is very rapid. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
