Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from medium acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 1 to 3.  When present the Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has colors and textures similar to the Bt horizons and the E part of the B/E horizon has colors and textures similar to the E horizon. Some pedons have an E/B horizon above the B/E with colors and textures similar to the B/E.  The Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR with chroma of 3 or 4. They are silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is stratified silty clay loam, silt loam, silt or fine sandy loam."

The Froberg soils are underlain by sandy loam till.  The Nester and Watton soils formed in loamy glacial till and do not have textural stratification.  Ontonagon soils formed in clay and have less stratification."
