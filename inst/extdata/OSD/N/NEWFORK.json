The mean annual soil temperature is about 37 to 40 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is about 52 to 58 degrees F.  The control section is very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has few or common mottles.  This horizon is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and base chroma of 1 or 2.  It has common or many mottles.  This horizon is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  The matrix material is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.  Gravel ranges from 45 to 65 percent and cobbles from 0 to 15 percent.  This horizon has common to many mottles.
