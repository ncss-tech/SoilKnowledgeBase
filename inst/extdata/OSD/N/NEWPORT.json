  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 through 40 inches (50 through 100 centimeters) and typically corresponds to the depth to the dense substratum. Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 6 feet feet (2 meters). Rock fragments range from 5 through 30 percent by volume in the solum and from 10 through 35 percent in the substratum. Except where the surface is stony, the fragments are mostly flat and less than 6 inches in diameter. Channers and gravel typically make up 75 percent or more of the total rock fragments. Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid. Low chroma colors in the B and C horizons are lithochromic.\nSome pedons have an O horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Dry value is 6 or more. Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap or A horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. Some pedons have redoximorphic features just above the Cd horizon. The Bw horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak subangular blocky or granular structure, or the horizon is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. The horizon has weak or moderate, thin through thick plates, or it is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Newport soils are nearly level through moderately steep and are on till plains, low ridges, hills and drumlins. Slope ranges from 0 through 35 percent. The soils formed in acid lodgement till derived mainly from dark carboniferous, sandstone, conglomerate, argillite, and phyllite. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 through 52 degrees F. (7 through 11 degrees C.), mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 through 50 inches (1016 through 1270 mm), and the growing season ranges from 135 through 185 days."

The moderately well drained Pittstown, poorly drained Stissing, and the very poorly drained Mansfield soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Birchwood and Poquonock soils have a sandy over loamy particle-size control section. Narragansett and Wapping soils have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR in the upper part of the B horizon and a friable substratum. Quonset and Warwick soils are on nearby terraces and are underlain by stratified coarse-textured deposits."

    "content": "REMARKS: This revision reflects changes to the range in characteristics as well as general updating to metric units.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (0 to 20 centimeters)(Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 24 inches (20 to 61 centimeters) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\n3. Densic material - the zone from 24 to 65 inches (61 to 165 centimeters) (Cd horizon).\n4) Particle-size control section - the zone from 10 through 24 inches (20 through 61 centimeters) (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\n5) Oxyaquic subgroup - based on saturation in one or more layers within 40 inches (100 centimeters) of the mineral soil surface, for either or both 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Full characterization data for sample no. 58RI005001, 58RI009001, S08RI005001.
