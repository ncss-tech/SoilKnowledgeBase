The particle-size control section averages 10 to 15 percent clay, less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand, and less than 1 percent coarse fragments.  The soil is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is weak coarse prismatic and weak thin platy structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is mostly silt loam but some pedons have thin lenses of very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry and in some pedons is mottled below a depth of 36 inches.  The C horizon contains (1/8 to 3/8 inch) lenses of very fine sandy loam in some pedons."

The average July temperature is 64 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 38 degrees F.; and the average temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 190 days."
