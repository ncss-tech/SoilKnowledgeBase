The poorly drained Brookston soils are located on similar positions but do not have limestone bedrock within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). The moderately well drained Corwin soils and the somewhat poorly drained Francesville and Odell soils are on higher landform positions. Corwin and Odell soils are not underlain by limestone bedrock within 152 cm (60 inches)."

Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the subsoil and underlying material, and low or very low in the limestone bedrock. Permeability is moderate in the subsoil, moderately slow in the underlying material, and very slow or impermeable in the limestone bedrock."
