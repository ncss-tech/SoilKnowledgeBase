Slopes are 0 to 2 percent and are dominantly less than 0.5 percent.  Elevations are 1,190 to 1,250 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm; mean annual air temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
