    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Total thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches. Rounded or subrounded rock fragments,  from 2mm to 10 inches across range from 0 to as much as 15 percent in individual horizons. Coal fragments from 1mm to 3 inches also range from 0 to 15 percent. The particle-size control section is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand, and contains strata (5mm to 4 inches thick) of very fine to medium sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4, but after mixing to a depth of 6 inches has value and chroma moist less than 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand and is commonly stratified.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. Most pedons are stratified with strata of very fine to medium sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Gibraltar series in the same family and both the Klum and Pillery series in similar families. Gibraltar soils formed in recent alluvium derived from coal washing that has been deposited over alluvium weathered from reddish sandstone, siltstone, or shale. Klum soils formed in alluvium washed from glacial soils and they have loamy fine sand strata less than 10 inches thick. Pillery soils formed in alluvium derived from basic igneous rock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Nelse soils are on banks of major streams and rivers. Most areas are long and narrow. Slope is dominantly 12 to 25 percent, but ranges from 0 to 25 percent. These soils formed in recent sandy or loamy alluvium and receive fresh sediments from flooding. They are commonly stratified and contain thin strata or lenses of sand or loamy sand. These materials washed from soils formed over rock dominated by strongly acid to neutral sandstone, siltstone, shale, and a minor component of coal. Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F with a mean of 56 degrees. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 49 inches with a mean of 43 inches."

Allegheny, Chavies, Elk, and Shelbiana soils have argillic horizons. Combs, Grigsby, Nolin, Orrville, and Rowdy soils have cambic horizons. Allegheny, Orrville, and Rowdy soils are in a fine-loamy family. Elk, Nolin, and Shelbiana are in a fine-silty family. Potomac soils are in a sandy-skeletal family and Yeager soils are in a sandy family. With the exception of Combs and Shelbiana, none of these soils have mollic epipedons. Allegheny, Shelbiana, Chavies, and Elk soils are on nearby stream terraces. Combs, Grigsby, Nolin, Orrville, Potomac, Rowdy, Stokly, and Yeager soils are on adjacent flood plains. Potomac soils are somewhat excessively drained. Orrville and Stokly soils are somewhat poorly drained."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Nelse soils were mostly mapped as steep alluvial land in the past, or included with adjoining soils.\nDiagnostic features recognized in this pedon are:\nAn A horizon that in the upper 6 inches, after mixing, has colors as dark as those of a mollic epipedon. Typically, the A horizon is thick enough and dark enough for a mollic or an umbric epipedon, but is excluded because the other sediments are finely stratified below 6 inches. The soil does not have other diagnostic horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference sample 84KY-195-1 by the University of Kentucky.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
