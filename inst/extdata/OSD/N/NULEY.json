  "OVERVIEW": "The Nuley series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from metamorphic and igneous rock. These soils are on hills and bedrock floored plains. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
