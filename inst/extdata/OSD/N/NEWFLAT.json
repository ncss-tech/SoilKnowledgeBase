The soil horizon depths were revised on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 6 inches (O, A and E)\n2.  Argillic horizon - the zone between 6 and 76 inches (Bt, Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3)\n3.  Clayey - more than 35 percent clay in the partical-size control section.\n4.  Base saturation - Is less than 35 percent at 55 inches.\n5.  Aeric - 4 chroma dominant below the E horizon (2 chroma or less is present)"
