Quartz gravel make up 0 to 2 percent of the solum.  The particle-size control section has more than 30 percent silt.  Aluminum saturation on the exchange complex is commonly greater than 50 percent and ranges from 10 to 20 meq/100 grams of soil.  Fine flakes of mica range from few to common in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 1OYR or 2.5Y or it is neutral, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2. Horizons with value of 3 are 6 inches or less thick.  The A horizon is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 1OYR or 2.5Y or it is neutral, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2. Horizons with value of 3 are 6 inches or less thick.  The Ap horizon is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The E horizon is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 1OYR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  In some pedons, it is mottled with gray.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. It has common to many high and low chroma redox features.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 1OYR through 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  (This section not checked this date; particle-size and activity class changes) Wahee is the only known series in this family. Wahee soils have slow permeability and COLE of .09 or less throughout the argillic horizon.  Similar soils in related families include Dunbar, Lenoir, and Smithboro.  Dunbar and Smithboro soils have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Lenoir soils have less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the sand and silt fraction of the particle-size control section."

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 49 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F near the type location.  Elevation at the type location is about 60 feet."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Newflat soils have previously been included with Wahee and Lenoir soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 5 inches (A and E)\n2.  Argillic horizon - the zone between 5 and 75 inches (Bt, Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3)\n3.  Clayey - more than 35 percent clay in the partical-size control section.\n4.  Base saturation - Is less than 35 percent at 55 inches.\n5.  Aeric - 4 chroma dominant below the E horizon (2 chroma or less is present)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle-size, chemical, and engineering data from VPI & SU is available for the typical pedon (79VA-149-50).
