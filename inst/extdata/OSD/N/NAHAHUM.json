  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle-size control section contains 15 to 35 percent hard rock fragments.  The upper 7 to 20 inches of the soil has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  Base saturation is assumed to be above 35 percent in all parts and below 75 percent in some parts above 30 inches (Ultic intergrade).  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is ashy loam, gravelly ashy loam, ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam.  In some pedons, this horizon is identified as a Bw.\nThe 2Bt horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6 dry or moist.  It is gravelly clay loam, cobbly clay loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam.  It has 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2BC or 2C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  It cobbly clay loam, cobbly sandy clay loam, gravelly loam, or cobbly loam.  It has 22 to 30 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nahahum soils are on mountainsides at elevations of 2,500 to 4,800 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  They formed in residuum, colluvium, and glacial till derived from gneiss or schist with minor amounts of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 40 to 49 degrees F.  The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 67 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 85 to 145 days."

Nard soils are less than 10 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Mippon soils are on floodplains and have a mollic epipedon, lack an argillic horizon, and are sandy-skeletal."
