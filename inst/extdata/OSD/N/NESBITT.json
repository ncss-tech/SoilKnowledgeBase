  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

Content of coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the A and Bt horizons and 0 to 10 percent in the 2Bt horizon. Fragic characteristics in one or more horizons are commonly present within 30 inches of the surface, but the range extends to 40 inches or deeper.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, except severely eroded areas are silty clay loam.\nMany pedons have a transitional horizon with color and texture similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redox features with chroma 2 or less are present within 30 inches of the soil surface. These redox features are in shades of brown, gray, or red and range from none to common throughout.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Commonly, the middle and lower parts of the Bt horizon are brittle in 25 to 50 percent of the mass. Some pedons have up to 5 percent of grayish silty eluvial material in seams, streaks, and pockets in the lower part of the Bt horizon and upper part of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Redox features are in shades of brown, red and gray.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."
