  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness to a contrasting loamy horizon ranges from 24 to 36 inches.  The upper part of the 10- to 40-inch control section is clayey with clay content ranging from 38 to 60 percent, and COLE values of .07 to .12.  The lower part of the control section is loamy with 25 to 35 percent less clay than the upper part.  Reaction is typically mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and calcareous throughout, but some pedons range to neutral below a depth of 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1.  Texture is clay or silty clay and clay loam in lower part.  Some pedons have a brownish clay loam surface overwash less than 10 inches thick.\nThe 2C and 3C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.  Most pedons have a 3C with textures of loamy fine sand or fine sand below a depth of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar competing soils include the Cameron, Navidad, Seagoville, Tinn, and Trinity series.  All of these lack contrasting textures in the control section except the Cameron and Seagoville soils.  Cameron soils have mixed mineralogy and mean annual soil temperatures greater than 72 degrees F.  Seagoville soils are Vertisols and have colors with chroma of 2 in the upper part."

The soil formed in calcareous clayey and loamy alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 42 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 68 to 70 degrees F., and Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 48 to 58."

Bleiblerville, Branyon, and Frelsburg soils are clayey throughout and are above on upland positions.  Kuy soils have thick sandy epipedons and are on terraces slightly above Navaca soils."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Navaca soils are used predominantly for rangeland and pasture.  Native vegetation is mainly hackberry, elm, oak, and pecan trees and various species of paspalum, panicum, and uniola.  Pasture grasses are mainly improved species of bermudagrass.  A few areas are in cultivation, mainly to corn and hybrid forage sorghums."
