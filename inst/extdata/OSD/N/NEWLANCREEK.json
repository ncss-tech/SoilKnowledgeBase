  "OVERVIEW": "The Newlancreek series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or residuum from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on escarpments and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",
