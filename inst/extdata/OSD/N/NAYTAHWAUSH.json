These soils contain 1 to 8 percent by volume of rock fragments of mixed lithology that are mostly gravel size.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam or fine sandy loam.  This layer qualifies for a mollic epipedon except for thickness. Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam. Subhorizons of sandy clay loam may be present.  The percent clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Clay films are typically faint to distinct and common to continuous with chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay, clay loam, silty clay or silty clay loam. Clay films are faint to distinct and few to common with chroma of 2 or 3.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Naytahwaush soils are on nearly level to very steep convex slopes on glacial moraines.  The slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils primarily formed in calcareous, clay loam glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Field observations and lab data suggests there has been differential sorting (flow till) of this till from ice melting, accounting for the silty and clayey nature of the upper part of most pedons. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 25 inches.  Frost-free days range from 95 to 130.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1100 to 1600 feet."
