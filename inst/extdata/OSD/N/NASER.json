  "OVERVIEW": "The Naser series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone and shale. Naser soils occur on alluvial flats and fan skirts. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm. The mean annual air temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
