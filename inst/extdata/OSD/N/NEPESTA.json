(Btk horizon)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\n5/2013 The previous classification of Ustic Haplargids is changed to the taxonomic class, fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Argiustolls based on an update field project in the upper Arkansas River Valley. This also moves the type location from Prowers County to Otero County, Colorado.\nModified format by LRM and JCR in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nTaxonomic Version: Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
