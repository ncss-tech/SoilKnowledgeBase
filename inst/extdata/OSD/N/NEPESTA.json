  "OVERVIEW": "The Nepesta series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary materials.  Nepesta soils are on paleoterraces and interfluves. The surface horizons formed in clayey alluvium from sediment-rich irrigation water and the subsoil and substratum formed in eolian deposits and silty alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F.) and the mean annual precipitation is about 305 millimeters (12 inches).",

(Btk horizon)\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\n5/2013 The previous classification of Ustic Haplargids is changed to the taxonomic class, fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Calcidic Argiustolls based on an update field project in the upper Arkansas River Valley. This also moves the type location from Prowers County to Otero County, Colorado.\nModified format by LRM and JCR in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nTaxonomic Version: Eleventh Edition, 2010"
