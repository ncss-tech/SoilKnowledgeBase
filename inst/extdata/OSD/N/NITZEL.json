These soils formed in alluvium over flood deposits with volcanic ash and loess mixed in the upper part. Elevations are 1,400 to 2,400 [SW17]feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and  the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  The mean annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F..
