    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Naha soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevations are 4,900 to 6,l00 feet. The Naha soils formed in moderately, thick sandy alluvium over stratified loamy alluvium. The sandy upperpart has been reworked extensively by wind. The stream alluvium is derived from sedimentary rock, dominantly sandstone and shale. The average annual precipitation is 6 to l0 inches; the average annual air temperature is 52to 57 degrees F., and the frost-free period is l30 to 180 days. The climate is cool arid continental. Precipitation falls as intense summer thunderstorms and as gentle winter rain or snow."

Polacca soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Sheppard soils are sandy. Tewa soils are fine-loamy and have cambic horizons."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Contrasting particle size - An abrupt textural change from sands to loamy material at about 27 inches.\n2. Dual infiltration rates - Rapid in the sandy part and slow in the loamy part.\n3. Mottles - High infiltration rates and low available water capacity in the sandy upper story allow water to move to the loamy lower part and perch as the contact. Some areas are moderately well drained.\nPronounced Na-ha'.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nUpdate and revisions for the correlation of Chinle Area (AZ713), August 2011, LJG2\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
