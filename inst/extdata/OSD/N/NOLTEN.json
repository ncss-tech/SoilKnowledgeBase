Elevation ranges from 7,000 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 25 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.

The change is due to a redefining of the Udic and Typic subgroups of Argiustolls in Amendments to Soil Taxonomy 615.43 page 615-105.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
