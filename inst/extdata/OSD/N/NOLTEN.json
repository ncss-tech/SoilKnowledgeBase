  "OVERVIEW": "The Nolten series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to weathered bedrock.  These soils formed in material weathered from andesite, sandstone, siltstone, or shale.  Nolten soils are on hills and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
