  "OVERVIEW": "The Nortez series consists of moderately deep to sandstone, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  Nortez soils are on mesas, ridges, and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
