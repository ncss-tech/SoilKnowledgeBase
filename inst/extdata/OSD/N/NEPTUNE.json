These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  By weighted average the control section has 55 to 70 percent pebbles.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry.\nThe AC horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist, 1 through 3 dry.  it is very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand, or extremely gravelly loamy sand.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has variegated hues in 10YR or 2.5Y.  It is extremely gravelly medium sand or extremely gravelly coarse sand.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Marine shells fragments range from 5 to 25 percent, all less then 1/2 inches in size."

Average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches.  Mean January temperature is 37 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.
