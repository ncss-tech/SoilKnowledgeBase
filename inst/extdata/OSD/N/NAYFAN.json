These soils formed in colluvium derived from limestone and calcareous shale over residuum derived from calcareous shale.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,980 to 2,290 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
