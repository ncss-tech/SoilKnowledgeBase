  "OVERVIEW": "The Nayfan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary rocks.  Nayfan soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
