Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 5,130 to 8,450 feet. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 40 inches, most of which comes as snow. The mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
