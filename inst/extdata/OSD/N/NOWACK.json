  "OVERVIEW": "The Nowack series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from andesite or tuff. Nowack soils are on mountains. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
