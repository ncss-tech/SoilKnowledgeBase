  "OVERVIEW": "The North Powder series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from quartz diorite, granite, or meta gabbro.  North Powder soils are on hills and have slopes of 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 75 percent of the time (cumulative) during the period that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F, and the soils are continuously moist in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for at least the 3 months period following the winter solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  Some pedons have few thin clay films in pores and very few on faces of peds.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  This horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and is calcareous in some or all parts.  It is loam, clay loam, gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam or sandy loam.  It has 0 to 30 percent gravel."

Agency soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Ferdelford soils are calcareous throughout except for the thin A1 horizon and have weathered tuff at a depth of less than 20 inches.  Legler, Defenbaugh, and Pocan soils are more than 40 inches deep.  Oxman soils are calcareous throughout.  Potratz soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.   Redmond soils have 20 to 60 percent ash in the particle-size control section and have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

The soils formed in colluvium from quartz diorite or granite with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the A horizon.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."
