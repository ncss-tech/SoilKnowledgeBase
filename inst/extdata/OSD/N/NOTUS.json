  "OVERVIEW": "The Notus series consists of very deep, moderately well or somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Notus soils are on flood plains and low terraces and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
