(Bt and BtC1 horizons)\nThe base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the argillic is less than 35 percent.\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 22 inches.  (A and E horizons)\nArenic - thickness of A & E horizons is sandy to a depth of 20 to 40 inches.\nArgillic - 22 to 80 inches.  (Bt and BCt horizons)\nClay decrease with depth - the clay control decreases with depth from the top of the argillic by more than 20 percent absolute within the depth of 60 inches.\nAdditional Comments: The series was revised in January 2001 as part of the update of MLRA 150A .  The classification was changed from thermic to hyperthermic temperature regime.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S81TX-015-1 and S81TX-015-2 from Austin County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization Data by NSSL:  S81TX-015-1 and S81TX-015-2.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
