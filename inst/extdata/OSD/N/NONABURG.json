  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to soft bedrock ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is greater than 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.  Rock fragments are mostly channers and gravel of shale and shaly limestone and range from 2 to 45 percent in individual horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E horizon, where present, has hue 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  When present, mottles are in shades of red, brown, or yellow.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe BC horizon and C horizons, where present, have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  When present, mottles are shades of red, brown, yellow, and gray.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe Cr horizon is brownish, yellowish, or olive calcareous shale that is tilted.  This horizon sometimes contains 10 to 30 percent fine-earth fraction with colors and textures similar to the BC and C horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. Series in closely related families are the Bays, Bub, Conasauga, Dandridge, and Needmore series.  Bays soils have a loamy particle-size control section and a discontinuous argillic horizon.  Bub soils have hues of 10R to 5YR and formed in glauconitic materials.  Conasauga soils are moderately deep and moderately well drained.  Dandridge soils have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section, are in a mesic family, and have a discontinuous argillic horizon.  Needmore soils are moderately deep and are in a mesic family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nonaburg soils are on dissected uplands. Slopes range from 5 to 80 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from calcareous shale that has thin strata of limestone in some places.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bays, Conasauga, and Loyston series in similar positions, the Tellico and Red Hills series on nearby uplands, and the Hamblen, Pettyjon, and Steadman series in adjacent flood plains and drainageways.  Bays soils are in a fine-loamy family, and lack a continuous argillic horizon.  Conasauga soils are deeper than 20 inches to weathered bedrock.  Loyston soils have hard bedrock at a depth shallower than 20 inches.  Tellico soils are very deep, are in a clayey family, and have redder hues.  Red Hills soils are moderately deep, are in a fine-loamy family, and have redder hues.  Hamblen soils are moderately well drained and in a fine-loamy family.  Pettyjon soils are well drained and in a fine-loamy family.  Steadman soils are moderately well drained and in a fine-silty family."
