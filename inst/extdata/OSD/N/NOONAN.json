  "OVERVIEW": "The Noonan series consists of very deep, well drained or moderately well drained soils formed in till.  Permeability is moderate on the surface and slow in the Btn horizons.  These soils are on till plains and uplands and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 14 inches.",
