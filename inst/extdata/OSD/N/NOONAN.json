The depth to carbonates ranges from 8 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon l/2 to 6 inches thick.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is clay loam, but, silty clay or clay are within the range.  It has more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand.  It is neutral to strongly alkaline.  It has moderate or strong columnar or prismatic structure which parts to moderate or strong angular or subangular blocky structure.  Some pedons have a Btnz horizon below a depth of 16 inches. Some pedons have a Bw or Btkn horizon below the Btn horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.

Niobell soils have tonguing or interfingering of the E horizon into the Bt horizon.  Miranda soils have visible salts or gypsum within depths of 16 inches.  Tonka soils are in depressions.  They are poorly drained."
