Potential competitors in the obsolete subgroup of Lithic Eutrocryepts are the Clinetop, Clugulch, Liesnoi, and Olathe (T) series.\nClinetop soils have a possible udic moisture regime and have mean summer soil temperature of 43 to 48 degrees F.  Clugulch soils have an ustic moisture regime, have Oi horizons, and less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Liesnoi soils have a udic moisture regime.  Olathe soils have a possible ustic moisture regime, have O horizons, and have less than 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Noname soils are on mountains and plateaus.  The typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from andesite or basalt.  Slopes are 3 to 80 percent.  Elevations range from 5,800 to 9,200 feet.  The climate is semiarid or subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 35 inches, the mean annual air temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
