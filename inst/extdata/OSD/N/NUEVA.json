The soil between depths of 6 and 19 inches is dry in all parts from May through October and is moist in some or all parts from November through April irrigated.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 30 degrees to 33 degrees F.\nThe 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section is stratified layers of loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 27 percent but averages greater than 18 percent and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser material.  Content of organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 5/1 or 4/1 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/2, 3/1 or 2/1.  It is loam or sandy loam and is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3 or 5/3, and moist color of 10YR 4/3 or 3/3.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons lack an Ab horizon.  Where present the Ab horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 4/1 and moist colors of 10YR 3/1, 2/1 or 3/2.   It is clay loam or silty clay loam."
