The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F.  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon typically has hue of 10YR, but some pedons range to 5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.   Shallow cracks may appear when the soil is dry.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has prominent brown or strong brown redox concentrations as masses and very dark gray or very dark grayish brown redox depletions. This horizon in some pedons, has grayish brown (10YR 5/2) stains when dry.  Clay content is 40 to 60 percent.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part and very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe BCt and C horizons, when present, have hue of 2.5Y moist and 10YR or 2.5Y dry, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has prominent strong brown redox concentrations as masses and dark grayish brown or very dark grayish brown redox depletions.  Clay content is 40 to 60 percent.
