  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on mountain slopes, alluvial fans, and old high terraces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in glacial drift, derived mainly from granite and schist.  Much of these materials has been moved by gravitational forces since deposition.  Some areas have a thin capping of eolian sediments or finer textured wash.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the winter and spring, and is in the form of snow.  The average annual temperature is 36 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is generally less than 50 days."

Leighcan and Grenadier soils have low base saturation and a loamy-skeletal control section.  Upson soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Frisco soils have an argillic horizon and a loamy-skeletal control section."
