  "OVERVIEW": "The Neche series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in recent alluvium deposited on older lake sediments.  These soils are on natural levees, splays, fans, and stream terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.",

Some pedons have very thin strata of coarser materials in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon typically has hue of 2.5Y, less commonly 5Y or 10YR; value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry; and chroma of 1 to 3. It is stratified alluvium ranging from silty clay loam to loam.  One or more Ab horizons are in most pedons.  Clayey, loamy, or sandy strata are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."
