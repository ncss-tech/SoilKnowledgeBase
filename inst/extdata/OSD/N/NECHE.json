Some pedons have very thin strata of coarser materials in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon typically has hue of 2.5Y, less commonly 5Y or 10YR; value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry; and chroma of 1 to 3. It is stratified alluvium ranging from silty clay loam to loam.  One or more Ab horizons are in most pedons.  Clayey, loamy, or sandy strata are below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Other competing series are the Cashel, Fairdale, Ladelle, Lamoure, La Prairie, Perella, Playmoor, and Rauville series.  Cashel soils have fine texture.  Fairdale soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Ladelle, Lamoure, La Prairie, Playmoor, and Rauville soils have thicker mollic epipedons. Perella soils have a regular decrease in organic matter with depth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in recent alluvium deposited on older lake sediments of glacial Lake Agassiz.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is from 18 to 20 inches."

Bearden, Glyndon, and Hegne soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches.  Fargo soils have a fine texture and have a Bw horizon.  Overly and Gardena soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 16 inches thick.  In addition, Gardena soils are coarse-silty."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (Ap and A horizons); irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth - fine stratifications below mollic epipedon (C1 horizon) and burried A horizons (Ab and A'b horizons); aquic subgroup extends April through June high water table at 3 to 6 feet.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
