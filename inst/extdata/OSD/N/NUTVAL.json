  "OVERVIEW": "The Nutval series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Nutval soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Burchflat and Vipont soils have a xeric moisture regime and are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Demner soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 76 cm from the soil surface and have C horizons dominated by cobbles.  Dooh soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Erig soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to lithic contacts.  Leroman and Staberg soils have a xeric moisture regime and are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to paralithic contacts.
