Bullvaro soils have mollic epipedons more than 76 cm thick, are strongly influenced by loess in the upper part of the profile, and have 60 to 75 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Burchflat and Vipont soils have a xeric moisture regime and are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Demner soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of 50 to 76 cm from the soil surface and have C horizons dominated by cobbles.  Dooh soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Erig soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to lithic contacts.  Leroman and Staberg soils have a xeric moisture regime and are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils have a xeric moisture regime and are deep to paralithic contacts.  Vetagrande soils have less than 40 percent medium sand through very coarse sand in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nutval soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 65 to 75 days."
