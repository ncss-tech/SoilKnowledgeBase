    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The loamy horizons extend to a depth of 40 to 60 inches or more below the surface.  The soil ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid to about 40 inches and from extremely acid through slightly acid below about 40 inches.  Gravel-size rock fragments commonly make up 0 to 2 percent of the soil, but range to 15 percent below a depth of about 40 inches. Some pedons have one or more buried A horizons.\nA horizon:\nColor--hue of 7.5YR through 5Y or is netural, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 2.  Value of 3 or less is limited to horizons less than 6 inches thick.  Some pedons have high chroma masses of iron accumulation.\nTexture--comonly is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam but ranges to loamy sand, sandy clay loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam.\nRedoximorphic features (if they occur)--iron masses in shades of brown, yellow, or red\nCg horizon:\nColor-- hue of 10YR through 5BG or is neutral, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2\nTexture--above about 40 inches commonly is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Pockets or strata of coarser or finer texture are in some pedons.  Below about 40 inches textures commonly are highly stratified and range from sand to clay.\nRedoximorphic features--iron masses in shades of brown, yellow, or red and iron depletions in shades of olive or gray"
