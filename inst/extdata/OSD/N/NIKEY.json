    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Agust, Algerita, Cronese, Grapevine, Guijarral, Rillino, Yipin, and Whitlock series. Agust soils have peak rainfall that occurs during August and September with the driest period between November through February. Algerita soils have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Cronese contain a brittle matrix that is cemented by silica and contain nodules and concretion in the particle size control section. Grapevine and Whitlock soils have less than 20 percent rock fragments in the control section. Guijarral soils are strongly or very strongly alkaline in the lower part of the profile. In addition, Cronese and Grapevine soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30) and Guijarral soils are in the San Joaquin Valley (MLRA 17) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November. Rillino soils have dominantly 10YR colors and the depth to the calcic horizons is 5 to 20 inches. Yipin soils have cambic horizon and average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section."

These soils formed in gravelly alluvium from limestone, sandstone and shale. The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 F., and the mean summer temperature is 79 to 84 F. The average annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches. Freeze free period is 180 to 200 days."
