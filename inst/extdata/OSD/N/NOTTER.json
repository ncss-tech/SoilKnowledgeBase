  "OVERVIEW": "Notter series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium from intermediate and basic igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Notter soils occur on alluvial fans, mountainsides and structural benches.  Slope ranges from 2 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Cortyzack and Emlin soils have a 25% decline in precipitation in July and August rather than an increase.  Eldgin soils has rock fragments derived from andesite, dacite, basalt, and tuft. Hysoop soils has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and hue ranges to 5YR. Morval soils have combined A and Bt horizons that are 24 to 35 inches thick, have fewer rock fragments in the Bk horizon, have a lithologic discontinuity below 46 inches, and occur in a climate that has 16 to 18 inches precipitation.  Nuley soils have gneiss bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Thunderhead soils have sedimentary bedrock at depths of 22 to 40 inches.  Varney soils do not have peak periods of precipitation in late summer and fall.  Villa Grove soils have a horizon of gypsum accumulation below 44 inches, have exchangeable sodium percentage of 5 to 20% in the argillic horizon and have mean annual precipitation of about 7 inches."
