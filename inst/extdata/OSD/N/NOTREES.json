  "OVERVIEW": "The Notrees series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in sandy and loamy eolian deposits of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm (18 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16.1 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
