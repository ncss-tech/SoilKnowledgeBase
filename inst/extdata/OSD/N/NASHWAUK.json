  "OVERVIEW": "The Nashwauk series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in dense, loamy till. They are on till plains, moraines and drumlins. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.\n.",
