  "REVDATE": "12/2015",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Nolena series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from granite or altered granite rock sources. Nolena soils are on mountains, hills and rock pediments. Slope ranges from 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
