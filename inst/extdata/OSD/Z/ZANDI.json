  "OVERVIEW": "The Zandi series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 1 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
