  "OVERVIEW": "The Zanbur series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium from weathered tuff and volcanic ash deposited over lacustrine sediments. Zanbur soils are on basin terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days). The soil between depths of 10 to 24 inches is dry in all parts from about July 1 to November 1 (l20 days). The soil moisture control section is dry less than half the time the soil temperature is about 41 degrees F. Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has try color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2 or 3/3. Texture is sandy loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.  Gravel range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/1, 6/2, 6/3 or 7/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\nMollic epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches. (Ap)\nLacks cambic horizon - the AC and C horizons have textures coarser than loamy very fine sand. The 2C horizons lack stronger chroma, redder hue or higher clay content than the underlying horizon. Structure is present in the 2C horizon, however, fine stratification (1/4 5mm) in unconsolidated lacustrine sediments is considered as rock structure.\nTexture control: sandy over loamy family: The particle control section (10 to 40 inches) the weighted average of the upper part of the control section is loamy sand and has 5 percent clay. The lower part of the control section is silt loam and has 15 percent clay.\nModerately well drained - Has a water table at depths of 42 to 60 inches unless artificially drained. Water table within 72 inches during winter month will effect septic tank interpretation and could decrease the longevity of deep rooted crops.\nOSED scanned by SSQA. Last revised by state on 4/86.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated."
