  "OVERVIEW": "The Zatoville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or alluvium derived from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
