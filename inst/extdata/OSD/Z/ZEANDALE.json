The Bourbonais (T) soils are coarse-silty over sandy and sit on similar landscapes. The Eudora soils have a mollic epipedon and are similar or slightly higher on the flood plain. Fluvaquents soils are non-calcareous to calcareous, well drained to somewhat poorly drained and are slightly lower on flood plain. Kimo soils are clayey over loamy and are lower on the flood plain. The Muscotah soils are fine and somewhat poorly drained and are higher on the flood plain. The Reading soils have an argillic horizon and are higher on the flood plain. The Rossville soils are fine-silty and are higher on the flood plains. The Stonehouse (T) soils are sandy and are on similar position on the flood plain. The Wabash soils are fine and are higher on the flood plain."
