Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,070 to 1,525 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, intermittently moist summers.   The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm. The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C and the frost-free season is 160 to 190 days."
