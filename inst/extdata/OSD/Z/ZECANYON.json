    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zecanyon soils are gently sloping to hilly on foothills and tablelands at elevations of 1,510 to 1,845 meters.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in winter and warm and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 330 to 410 mm and average annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 70 to 95 days."
