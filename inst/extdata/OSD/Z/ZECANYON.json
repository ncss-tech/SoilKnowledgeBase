  "OVERVIEW": "The Zecanyon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and slope alluvium from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Zecanyon soils are on foothills and tablelands. Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
