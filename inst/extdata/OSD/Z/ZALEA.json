The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from highly sheared metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 2500 to 3800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 160 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.

Pyrady soils are fine textured, greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock, and moderately well drained. Euchrand soils occur on side slopes of mountains, are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock, and loamy-skeletal.  Rilea soils are loamy-skeletal. Stackyards soils occur on north-facing side slopes of mountains, are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock, loamy-skeletal, and have umbric epipedons 10 to 20 inches thick.  Yorel soils lack argillic horizons."
