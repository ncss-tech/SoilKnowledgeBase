The average annual soil temperature at 20 inches in depth ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Clay averages 5 to 12 percent and rock fragments average from 35 to 65 percent in the particle-size control section. Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe A2 (or BA) horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 15 to 50 percent rock fragments dominated by gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist. Texture is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam with 25 to 65 percent rock fragments dominated by gravel and cobbles.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 6 dry or moist. Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy coarse sand with 35 to 65 percent rock fragments. Some pedons have texture that ranges to coarse sand with up to 75 percent rock fragments below 30 inches. Pararock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent."

Elevations are 1,600 to 2,500 feet in Washington and 3,050 to 5,660 feet in Idaho. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. The climate has warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 22 to 40 inches. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 120 days."
