  "OVERVIEW": "The Zeb series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium on fans and terraces. Slopes are dominantly 3 to 30 percent, but range to 65 percent in Idaho. The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
