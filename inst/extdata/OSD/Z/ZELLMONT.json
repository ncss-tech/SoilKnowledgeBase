  "REVDATE": "01/2000",
  "STATES": "KS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zellmont series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium over residuum derived from shale. Zellmont soils are on strath terraces in River Valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches (74 centimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F (14 degrees C).",
