  "OVERVIEW": "The Zeemal series consists of shallow to duripan, moderately well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and loess over lacustrine sediments.  They are on glaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
