These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for 105 to 120 consecutive days after the summer solstice. The particle-size control section from the surface to the duripan has moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass content, including 5 to 20 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 1 to 5 percent rock fragments, less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 4 to 10 percent. Depth to duripan is 10 to 20 inches. The duripan is weakly or moderately cemented. It is slightly to violently effervescent throughout the profile.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2AB horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR dry or moist, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma 1 through 3 dry or 2 or 3 moist. Reactions are slightly to moderately alkaline. Textures are ashy silt loam, ashy loam or ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y to 10YR dry or moist. Value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 through 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist. Reactions are slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk and 2C1 horizon has hue of 5Y or 10YR dry or moist. Value 5 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 through 3 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It is silt loam or loamy fine sand. Reactions are moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 5Y or 10YR dry, 2.5Y, 5Y or 10YR moist. Value of 4 through 8 dry and 2 through 5 moist. Chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist. Textures are silt loam or silty clay loam with an occasional thin layer of loamy fine sand. Reactions are moderate to strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zeemal soils are in glaciolacustrine bottoms and small depressions. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. This soil formed in volcanic ash and pumice mixed with loess overlying glacial lacustrine sediments. Elevation ranges from 2,000 to 2,600 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is 27 degrees F and average July temperature is 71 degrees F. Average annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost free period is 130 to 180 days."

Ellisforde soils are in bottoms and lack duripans. Simsfield soils are in bottoms and are moderately deep to a duripan. St.Andrews soils are on toe slopes and transition areas between glacial till and lacustrine areas and have an argillic horizon."
