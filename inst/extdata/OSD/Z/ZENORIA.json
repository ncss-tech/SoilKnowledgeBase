  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zenoria series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils. They formed in loamy alluvium mantled by a thin layer of more recent clayey sediments. These soils are on low stream terraces of late Pleistocene or early Holocene age. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
