  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments of sandstone and shale channers make up 5 to 45 percent of individual horizons in the solum (average less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section) and 20 to 70 percent of the substratum.  Colluvium or residuum discontinuities are common in most pedons below a depth of 40 inches.  The soil ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2Bt horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon has a color range the same as that of the 2Bt horizons.  It is loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.  Discontinuities are in residuum from shale with matrix and mottle colors in shades of red, brown, and gray."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The only known series in this family are the Clymer soils.  Clymer soils have bedrock less than 60 inches.  Downer, Massanutten, Phalanx, and Woodmansie series are in closely related families.  Downer, Phalanx, and Woodmansie soils formed in coastal plain sediments and have less rock fragments throughout the solum.  Massanutten soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Nolansburg soils have more sand below 40 inches and do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  Dunellen, Jefferson, and Rigley soils are in related families.  Dunellen and Rigley soils have mixed mineralogy.  Jefferson soils are in a fine-loamy family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zepp soils are on sideslopes, benches, fans and footslopes, often below sandstone escarpments.  Slopes range from 2 to 55 percent.  The regolith is colluvium from acid sandstone, siltstone, and a minor component of shale.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 56 degrees F."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils have previously been included in the Rigley series.\nThe major diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (A and \tBA horizons).\nb.  Argillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 57 inches (Bt and 2Bt horizons).\nc.  Lithologic discontinuity - The change in parent material at 48 inches.\nThe 12/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based geographically associated soils and NASIS data from Page and Shenandoah Counties, Virginia. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available. In addition, horizon nomenclature and competing series were updated with this revision.\nPrevious revision JSO-LWH-MHC 5/89\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle size, chemical, and sand mineralogy data from the site location are available from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
