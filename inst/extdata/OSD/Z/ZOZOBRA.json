Slopes are 5 to 12 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 6,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.   The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Jaconita soils are sandy-skeletal, contain less calcium carbonate, and occur on footslopes and backslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Khapo soils are coarse-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on toeslopes of eroded fan remnants. Panky soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on summits of eroded fan remnants."
