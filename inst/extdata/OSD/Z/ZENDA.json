  "OVERVIEW": "The Zenda series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These soils are on low terraces and flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 24 inches, and mean annual temperature is 58 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 35 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Free carbonates typically are present below the A horizon and are present in the A horizon in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam, loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  A few pedons have chroma of 1 or less below a depth of 30 inches.  It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have strata of sandy loam or loamy sand, especially below a depth of 40 inches.  Distinct high or low chroma mottles are present in the lower part of the C horizon.  Some pedons have an AC or B horizon with color, texture, and reaction like that described for the C horizon.  Some pedons have coarse sand or loamy sand below 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Zenda series is the only series in its family.  Competing series in other families are the Bippus, Bosque, Caruso, Gageby, Kaski, Kosse, Lesho, Paloduro, Plevna, Spur, Sweetwater, and Waldeck series.  Bippus, Bosque, Gageby, and Kaski soils have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Caruso soils are mesic.  Kosse, Plevna, and Sweetwater soils are wetter.  Lesho and Sweetwater soils have contrasting textures.  Paloduro and Spur soils lack mottles and, in addition, the Paloduro soils have a regular decrease in organic matter.  Plevna and Waldeck soils are coarse-loamy."

The soils formed in loamy alluvium which typically is underlain by sandy strata at depths of 4 to 6 feet.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 69 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 35 inches.  Thornthwaite Annual PE Index ranges from 30 to 56."

Kaski, Lesho, Plevna, and Waldeck soils are on similar positions as Zenda soils."
