The mean annual soil temperature is between 47 to 55 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 9 to 30 inches is usually dry all of the time from late July until late September or early October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Cobbles and stones range from 10 to 70 percent throughout the profile with the textural control section averaging more than 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2; 5YR 3/3, 4/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/2, 3/3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam and is modified by 10 to 65 percent gravel and/or 10 to 40 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has dry colors of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 6/4; 5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4.

Elevations range from 3,500 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid having a mean annual precipitation of 45 to 70 inches, some of which occurs as snow.  Average January temperature is 34 degrees F; average July temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 43 to 51 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 150 days."

Hurlbut soils are moderately deep, on metasedimentary rock and are non-skeletal.  McCarthy soils are moderately deep to andesitic mud flow and are influenced by amorphous material.  Putt soils have a weakly cemented layer within 40 inches and are influenced by amorphous material."
