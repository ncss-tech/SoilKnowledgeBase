  "OVERVIEW": "The Zeibright series consists of deep to very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from glacial deposits.  These soils are on lateral and terminal glacial moraines and outwash and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is between 47 to 55 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 9 to 30 inches is usually dry all of the time from late July until late September or early October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Cobbles and stones range from 10 to 70 percent throughout the profile with the textural control section averaging more than 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has dry colors of 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2; 5YR 3/3, 4/3.
