    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in late summer and early fall.  Depth to redoximorphic features of faint and distinct concentrations is 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 16 to 30 inches; calcic horizon based on over 15 percent calcium carbonate and the presence of 5 percent or more identifiable secondary carbonates.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.\nThe Ak horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 6 dry, 3 moist, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It has weak or moderate platy and weak to strong granular structure.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  SAR is 5 to 13.  Calcium carbonate percent is 15 to 40.  It has 3 to 5 percent organic matter.\nThe ABk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Calcium carbonate percent is 30 to 85.  It has 1 to 3 percent organic matter.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent total clay and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  It is typically massive in the lower part with the upper part being weak platy and weak very fine and fine granular.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  SAR is 5 to 13.  Calcium carbonate percent is 30 to 85.  It has few to many, indurated to strongly cemented carbonate concretions up to 3 inches in diameter below a depth of about 30 inches; above 30 inches carbonate accumulations are visible but are not cemented.  Organic matter is 0 to 1 percent."
