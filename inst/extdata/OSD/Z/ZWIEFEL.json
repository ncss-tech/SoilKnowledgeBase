  "OVERVIEW": "The Zwiefel series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits overlain by eolian sand. These soils are in hummocky areas on playas and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual  precipitation is about 9 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 64 to 67 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 or more consecutive days in the autumn.  The upper part of the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from loamy fine sand to sand.  The lower part of the control section ranges from heavy silty clay loam to clay and averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  Dark colors in stratifications are due to dark colored sand grains.  Deviation of lime content in the profile is mainly due to parent material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  In some pedons the A horizon is not calcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6, 7 or 8 dry."
