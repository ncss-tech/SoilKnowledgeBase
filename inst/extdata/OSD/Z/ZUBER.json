The soil contains 0 to 8 percent by volume of 2 mm to 5 cm limestone fragments, ironstone nodules, and iron nodules.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The A and AB horizons are sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has few to common mottles in shades of gray, yellow, or red.  Texture of the Bt horizon is sandy clay or clay.  The upper part of the Bt horizon may be sandy loam or sandy clay loam; however, the control section has 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe BC horizon has the same matrix colors as the Bt horizon with common to many mottles in shades of red, gray or yellow; or it is mottled in shades of brown, red, gray, or yellow.  Texture of the BC horizon is sandy clay loam, sandy clay or clay."
