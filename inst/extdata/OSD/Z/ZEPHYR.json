  "OVERVIEW": "The Zephyr series consists of very poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments under conditions favorable for accumulation of thin deposits of organic materials.  They are in depressions and on low flats surrounded by flatwoods in Peninsular Florida.  Slope gradient is less than 2 percent.",

The soil horizon depths were modified on 10/2021 to ensure the description began at the soil surface (13 inch adjustment).  The horizon designations were also modified for the soil profile."
