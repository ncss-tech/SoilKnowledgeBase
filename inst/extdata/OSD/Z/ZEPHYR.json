Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe Oa horizon is in hue 5YR, value 2 or 3, chroma 2 to 4; hue 10YR, value 2, chroma 1; or hue N, value 2.\nThe A1&A2 horizon is less than 20 inches thick.  It is sand or fine sand.  The A1 part has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, chroma 1; or hue N, value 2 to 4.  It occurs as large streaks concentrated at the upper boundary of the A2 horizon and extends downward throughout the A2 horizon.  The A2 part has hue 10YR, value 4 to 8, chroma 1 or 2, or hue N, value 4 to 8.  Some pedons have an A1 horizon.  Where present, it has the characteristics of the A1 horizon portion of the A1&A2 horizon and ranges to 8 inches thick.  Texture of the A1 horizon includes mucky fine sand.  Below the A1 is an A2 which has the characteristics of the A2 portion of the A1&A2 horizon.  Fine to medium mottles in shades of brown and gray may be present.\nThe A3 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value 4, chroma of 2 or 3 with or without fine to medium mottles in shades of brown and gray.\nThe B2tg horizon has hue of 10YR, value 4 to 7, chroma 1 with or without mottles, or chroma 2 with mottles; hue of 2.5Y, value 4 through 7, chroma 2 with mottles, or hue N, value 4 to 7.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zephyr soils are in wet depressions and on low flats within the flatwoods in central and southern Florida.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments under conditions favorable for accumulation of thin deposits of organic materials.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent.  Near the type location mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches and about 60 percent of this is received during the months June through September.  Mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F."

The water table is at depths less than 30 inches for most of the remainder of the year.  Permeability is rapid in the Oa and A horizons and slow in the Btg horizon."

Native vegetation is predominately cypress, swamp bay, a few pond pine, greenbrier, and water tolerant ferns and grasses.  In some areas there are red maple and pickerelweed."
