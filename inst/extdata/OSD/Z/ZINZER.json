    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 62 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 5 inches. Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 10 to 40 inches.  The soil above the calcic horizon ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline but subhorizons of the calcic horizon are very strongly alkaline in some pedons.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos above a depth of 20 inches except that a few discontinuous horizons totaling less than 4 inches in thickness and exceeding those limits occur in some pedons.  The control section averages 35 to 60 percent fine or coarser sand and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.  The rock fragments are dominantly 1 to 10 inches in diameter.  Hue ranges from 5Y through 7.5YR except that a few subhorizons having hue redder than 7.5YR occur discontinuously in some pedons and occupy less than half the thickness of the control section."
