They occur in adjacent grassland areas. Hiore and Tepecreek are forested. Hiore soils lack bedrock within 60 inches and have a cambic horizon.  Tepecreek soils have bedrock within 20 to 40 inches and have an argillic horizon.  Both these soils occur on more linear to concave slope positions relative to the Zonite series."

These soils support a range of Doulas-fir canopy densities from scattered individuals of Douglas-fir and rocky mountain juniper to partially closed stands of Douglas-fir with lodgepole pine.  Native vegetation in open areas is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, Idaho fescue, rubber rabbitbrush, Hood's phlox, fringed sagewort and miscellaneous small forbs with scattered conifers.  Sparse understory vegetation in partially closed stands is mainly bluebunch wheatgrass, common juniper, bitterbrush, kinnikinnick, elk sedge and heartleaf arnica."
