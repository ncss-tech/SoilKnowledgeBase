  "OVERVIEW": "The Zunker series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvial deposits. These nearly level soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 to 23 degrees C (70 to 74 degrees F).",
