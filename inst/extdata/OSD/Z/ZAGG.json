The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 50 to 55 percent of the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It commonly is silty clay loam or clay loam and less commonly gravelly clay loam.  The A horizon ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry.  It commonly is clay loam, silty clay, or clay, and less commonly silty clay loam.  The clay content ranges from 35 to 45 percent.
