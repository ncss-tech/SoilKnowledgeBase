  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons and depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between depth of 6 and 17 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1 and is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  Base saturation (sum) ranges from 40 to 75 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 5/6.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 25 percent.  Soft gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Where mollic colors occur the layer is too thin to meet the requirements for a mollic or umbric epipedon.  Reaction is strongly through slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/6, 7/6; 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6, 7/4 or 7/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/6, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6, 6/8 or 7/6.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent.  Soft gravel content ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe Cr horizon is soft highly weathered sandstone or mudstone that slakes in water.  It becomes harder with increasing depth."

The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A moderate coastal fog influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 220 to 320 days."

Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the layer from 0 to 4 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 16 to 30 inches Bt horizon\nParalithic contact - the boundary to weathered sandstone at 30 inches\nParalithic material has a similar AWC and bulk density to the overlying B horizons.  Nodules are thought to be due to the effects of forest fires and are not present in all pedons.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Complete pedon data on modal site:  NSSL S80-CA045-017, sample Nos. 80P2464-2468.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
