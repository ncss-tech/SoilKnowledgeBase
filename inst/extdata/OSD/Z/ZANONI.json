Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Lecoma soils are fine-loamy and are on foot slopes. Possumtrot soils do not have an argillic horizon. Razort soils are fine-loamy. Relfe soils are sandy-skeletal. Sandbur soils have dark colored surface horizons. Kaintuck, Relfe, and Sandbur soils are on flood plains.  Possumtrot and Razort soils are on stream terraces."
