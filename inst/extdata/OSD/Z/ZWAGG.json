  "OVERVIEW": "The Zwagg series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock.  Zwagg soils occur in open grassland areas on broad ridgetops and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days between 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 12 to 18 percent clay.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 25 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loam  with 12 to 18 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel.  Organic matter is 4 to 8 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is gravelly loam or very gravelly loam with 12 to 18 percent clay.  It has 30 to 60 percent gravel."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock of the Dothan Formation.  Elevation is 200 to 1300 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."

These soils are also occur on ridgetops and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Bosland soils are fine-loamy.  Dulandy soils are loamy-skeletal.  Floras soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact and are fine textured.  Guerin soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact and are loamy-skeletal.  Loeb, Macklyn, and Vondergreen soils have argillic horizons.  Wedderburn soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact and are fine-loamy."
