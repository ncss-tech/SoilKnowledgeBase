  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zapolote series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Zapolote soils are on relict basin floors, alluvial fans and low fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
