    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.  Series in related families are the Carmel, Gladdice, Ladoga, McKamie, and Pate series.  Carmel, Ladoga, and Pate soils formed in limestone, calcareous shale, and/or loess material in the Midwest.  Gladdice soils formed in limestone and McKamie soils formed in clayey alluvial sediments on stream terraces.  Both have a thermic soil temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zillicoa soils are gently sloping to moderately steep and are on ridge summits and side slopes of intermountain hills in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  Elevation ranges from about 1800 to 3000 feet.   Slopes are generally between 2 and 15 percent but range from 2 to 30 percent. The soils formed in residuum from coarse grained garnet hornblende fels. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 50 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Braddock, Clifton, Cowee, Evard, Marshill, Oteen, Tate, Unison, and Walnut series.  Except for Marshill, Oteen, and Walnut, these soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Marshill, and Walnut soils are coarse loamy, and Oteen is loamy.  Walnut and Oteen have weathered bedrock at depths 20 to 40 inches and 10 to 20 inches, respectively.   Cowee, Evard, and Tate soils are fine-loamy and have argillic horizons of 18 to 35 percent clay in the subsoil.  Braddock, Clifton, and Unison soils are clayey and have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay in the subsoil.  All of these soils except for Braddock, Tate, and Unison are on similar residual landscape positions.  Braddock and Unison soils are on broad, high terraces. Tate soils are on benches, fans, and toe slopes in coves."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Cleared areas are used primarily for pasture or hay production.  Forage crops include orchardgrass, red clover, lespedeza, tall fescue, and bluegrass.  Forested areas include Virginia pine, eastern white pine, shortleaf pine, white oak, chestnut oak, scarlet oak, black oak, and hickory.  Mountain laurel, flowering dogwood, sourwood, and black locust are common in the understory.  A small acreage is used for burley tobacco and small grain."
