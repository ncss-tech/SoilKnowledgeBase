  "OVERVIEW": "The Zillicoa series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on ridge summits and side slopes of the intermountain hills in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. They formed in coarse grained garnet hornblende fels.  Near the type location, mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 35 inches.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.",

Walnut and Oteen have weathered bedrock at depths 20 to 40 inches and 10 to 20 inches, respectively.   Cowee, Evard, and Tate soils are fine-loamy and have argillic horizons of 18 to 35 percent clay in the subsoil.  Braddock, Clifton, and Unison soils are clayey and have argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay in the subsoil.  All of these soils except for Braddock, Tate, and Unison are on similar residual landscape positions.  Braddock and Unison soils are on broad, high terraces.
