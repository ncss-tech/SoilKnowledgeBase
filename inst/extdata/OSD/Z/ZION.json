  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia triggered the reclassification of Zion to a mesic temerpature regime, with the type location already in Orange County, Virginia, well within the mesic area. The Redbrush series was establised as a mesic counterpart, but being superactive instead of active, and Typic instead of Ultic.  A review of lab data and correspondence show that these two series overlapped and did not justify two series. Redbrush was made inactive as a result of the final correlation of Iredell County, North Carolina.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 inches (A, E, and BEc horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 26 inches (Bt horizon)\nLithic contact--bedrock contact at 36 inches (R horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: 96NC169001, 96NC171001, 96NC171004\nDatabase Information:\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID--Unknown\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nVA0042 ZION        2-45   52-57  160-250    40-55   250-1000\nVA0227 ZION        2-45   52-57  160-205    40-55   250-1000\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nVA0042 NONE          >6.0       -      -       20-40   HARD\nVA0227 NONE          >6.0       -      -       20-40   HARD\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%  -CEC-\nVA0042  0-10  L SIL                   0-5   75-100  10-25    -\nVA0042  0-10  SL FSL                  0-5   85-100  5-18    -\nVA0042 10-18  GRV-CL GR-CL GR-L       0-0   25-50   20-40    -\nVA0042 18-26  C SIC SICL              0-0   90-100  35-60    -\nVA0042 26-36  GR-C CL C               0-20  45-95   35-50    -\nVA0042 36-46  UWB                      -      -       -      -\nVA0227  0-10  GR-L GR-SIL             0-0   50-75    7-27  15-45\nVA0227 10-18  GRV-CL GR-CL GR-L       0-0   25-50   20-40  39-71\nVA0227 18-26  C SIC SICL              0-0   90-100  35-60  55-82\nVA0227 26-36  GR-C CL C               0-20  45-95   35-50  19-59\nVA0227 36-46  UWB                      -       -      -      -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
