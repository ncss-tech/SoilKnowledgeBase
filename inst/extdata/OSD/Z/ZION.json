  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia triggered the reclassification of Zion to a mesic temerpature regime, with the type location already in Orange County, Virginia, well within the mesic area. The Redbrush series was establised as a mesic counterpart, but being superactive instead of active, and Typic instead of Ultic.  A review of lab data and correspondence show that these two series overlapped and did not justify two series. Redbrush was made inactive as a result of the final correlation of Iredell County, North Carolina.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 inches (A, E, and BEc horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 26 inches (Bt horizon)\nLithic contact--bedrock contact at 36 inches (R horizon)"
