  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The moisture control section is moist in some or all parts in March through June. Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to effervescent horizons is 2 to 8 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5T, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  It has 5 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, when present, has properties similar to the Bk horizon.  It typically has 3 to 5 percent less calcium carbonate than the overlying Bk horizon.  Some pedons may have sandy clay loam textures below 40 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Berthoud, Mcrae, Sixmile and Teromote series.  It is assumed the Atchison series is competing pending an update of the classification.  Atchison soils have annual soil temperatures of 56 to 59 degrees F.  Berthoud soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 57 degrees F.  The Mcrae soils occur in areas with less than 15 inches of precipitation.  Sixmile soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Teromote soils are usually dry in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ziggy soils are on fan remnants, terraces, alluvial fans, hills and ridges.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."

Iwait and Ucross soils lack cambic horizons.  Fairburn soils are shallow.  Deekay, Iwait and Oshoto soils occur on similar positions.  Fairburn, Oldwolf and Ucross soils occur on upland shoulders and crests."
