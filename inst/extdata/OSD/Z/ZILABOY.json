  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  Iron-manganese concretions and masses range from few to about 3 percent by volume in most pedons.  This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls about 4 to 10 inches higher than microdepressions.  The soil is saturated in one or more subhorizons within 40 inches of the surface for extended periods during most years.  When dry, cracks 1/4 to 2 inches wide are at the surface and 1/4 inch wide cracks extend to a depth of 20 inches are more.  The cracks are open for less than 90 cumulative days during most years.  Slickensides begin at a depth of 10 to 24 inches from the surface and extend to 40 inches or more.  The angle of the slickensides ranges from 10 to about 50 degrees from horizontal.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The texture is silty clay or clay.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, red, or gray range from few to many in most subhorizons. However, aquic conditions (reduction) are not present.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have a Bkss horizon with few to common concretions and masses of calcium carbonate.  Reaction of the Bkss horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have 2Bw or 2Bg horizons with texture of loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam below a depth of 60 inches.  The matrix color is in hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, red, or yellow range from few to many.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Garner (TX), Hollywood (AL), Kaman (TX), Maytag (AL), and Okolona (MS) series.  Similar soils are the Gladewater, Roetex, Texark, and Tinn series.  Garner soils have mollic colors less than 12 inches thick.  Hollywood soils typically have limestone bedrock at depths between 48 and 80 inches.  Kaman soils are poorly drained.  Maytag soils are well drained, and have more than 20 percent calcium carbonate in the lower part of the solum.  Okolona soils typically have hard platy chalk between 48 and 80 inches.  Gladewater, Roetex, and Texark soils have very-fine particle-size control sections.  In addition, Gladewater soils have aquic soil conditions in the upper 20 inches.  Roetex soils have matrix colors with hue redder than 7.5YR in the control section.  Tinn soils are calcareous throughout."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 40 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F.. Frost free days range from 225 to 280 days, and elevation ranges from 200 to 550 feet. The Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 58 to 64."

Gladewater and Tinn soils are on similar flood plains.  Bunyan, Oletha, Sandow, and Whitesboro soils have  fine-loamy control sections.  They are on similar or slightly higher flood plains.  Crockett, Mabank, Normangee, Vertel, and Wilson soils are on adjacent  uplands.  All of these soils except the Vertel series have argillic horizons.  Vertel soils have sola 24 to 40 inches thick  over shale.  Uhland soils have coarse-loamy control sections and they are on similar or slightly higher flood plains."
