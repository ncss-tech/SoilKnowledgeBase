  "OVERVIEW": "The Zeph series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed riverine alluvium.  Zeph soils are on flood plains.  Permeability is slow over very rapid.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
