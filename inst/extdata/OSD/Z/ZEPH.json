The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  Average annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."

Ajax soils are in depressions on flood plains and have fine textured particle-size control sections and mollic epipedons.  Wimpey soils are on smooth positions on flood plains and have contrasting particle-size control sections and mollic epipedons that are greater than 20 inches thick.  Ajax soils are in depressions on flood plains and Wimpey soils are on smooth positions on flood plains."
