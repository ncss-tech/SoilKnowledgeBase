  "STATES": "CA,NV,OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zorravista series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in mixed eolian material derived from mixed rocks.  The Zorravista soils are on semi-stabilized sand dunes and sand sheets superimposed on beach terraces, lake plains, barrier bars and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
