Goldrun soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 43 to 90 cm. Hotsprings soils have 20 to 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section. Grandora, Incy and Toll soils are noncalcareous throughout the profile. Quincy soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 38 cm.  Quinton, Lachim, Painter, Rinquin and Walco soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm.  Winchester soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 50 to 76 cm and have more than 75 percent medium sand or coarser in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zorravista soils are on semi-stabilized sand dunes and sand sheets superimposed on beach terraces, barrier bars, lake plains and alluvial fans.  These soils formed in eolian materials derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 1,190 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 130 days."

Lolak soils are poorly drained and fine textured.  Pegler soils have formed in loamy residuum from tuffs and are shallow.  Vylach soils have clay loam B2t horizons and weakly silica-cemented C horizons."
