  "OVERVIEW": "The Zittau series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils which are moderately deep to sand.  They formed primarily in clayey deposits overlying sandy deposits on glacial lake basins and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",
