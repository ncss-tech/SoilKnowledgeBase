  "OVERVIEW": "The Zuni series consists of moderately deep to gneissic-granite, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum derived from gneissic-granite. Zuni soils are on mountain sideslopes and domes. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
