  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum ranges in thickness from 35 to 46 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 59 degrees to 64 degrees F. These soils are continually moist between 4 and 12 inches from some time in November until April or May and dry the remainder of the year.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown, grayish brown, dark brown or brown; hue is 10YR or 2.5Y. It is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or light silty clay loam. The surface layer is both hard or very hard and massive when dry. The A horizon is about 2 to 4 percent organic matter.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe upper Bt horizon is dark grayish brown or brown, hue is 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma is 2 or 3. It is clay loam or silty clay loam that contains less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. The upper boundary is diffuse, gradual or clear and some pedons have a transitional AB horizon or BA horizon. It has about 6 to 10 percent more clay absolute than the A horizon, but averages slightly less than 35 percent total clay. It is either massive or has blocky structure and ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe lower Bt and Bwk horizons are brown, grayish brown, yellowish brown, pale brown, light yellowish brown or light olive brown. Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4. Texture is clay loam, silt loam, loam, sandy loam or gravelly loam. These horizons range from neutral to moderately alkaline and some pedons contain segregated lime and others lack it. In some pedons there is a stratified C horizon."

Burchell, Modesto, Perkins, and Pleasanton soils are members of a fine-loamy family. In addition, Burchell soils are moderately to strongly alkaline in the argillic horizon. Modesto soils have an abrupt or clear boundary with 10 to 15 percent more clay in the argillic horizon than in the epipedon.  Perkins soils have 5YR or 2.5YR hue in the argillic horizon. Pleasanton soils have less than 18 to 25 percent clay in the argillic horizon. Los Robles soils have a cambic horizon and lack a 20 percent increase in clay from A horizon to B horizon. Tehama soils have moist values of 4 or more in the A horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zamora soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping alluvial fans, stream  terraces and flood plains, usually 0 to 9 percent slopes at elevations of 30 to 1,300 feet. The soils formed in alluvium from material weathered from mixed rocks. They have a dry subhumid mesothermal climate with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 30 inches. Average January temperature is 45 degrees F., average July temperature is 75 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 63 degrees F. Average freeze-free season is about 250 to 330 days."

Brentwood soils lack argillic horizons and have 35 to 40 percent clay in the textural control section. Salinas and Sorrento soils have a mollic epipedon. Yolo soils lack an argillic horizon, but are otherwise very similar."
