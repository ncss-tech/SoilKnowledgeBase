  "OVERVIEW": "The Zillman series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes, terraces, and upper fan aprons.  They formed in slope alluvium and sediments of mixed origin.  Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Matrix texture is clay loam or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are made up of pebbles, cobbles, and stones which can occur in any combination.  Flagstones occur in some pedons.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is the same as the Bt except that clay ranges from 18 to 30 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 6 to 14 percent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
