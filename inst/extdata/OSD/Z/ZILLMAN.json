  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Matrix texture is clay loam or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are made up of pebbles, cobbles, and stones which can occur in any combination.  Flagstones occur in some pedons.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is the same as the Bt except that clay ranges from 18 to 30 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 6 to 14 percent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Badito, Beaverell, Circleville, Ipson, San Isabel, Simmont, and Uracca series.  The Badito series has tuff above 40 inches and lacks free carbonates throughout.  The Beaverell, San Isabel, and Uracca soils have very gravelly sand C or Bk horizons at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  Circleville and Simmont soils have hard bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Ipson soils have a calcic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  Elevations are 6,500 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and ranges from 10 to 16 inches of which about half falls as rain or snow in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F. and ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 50 to 90 days."
