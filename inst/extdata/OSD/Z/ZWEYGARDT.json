  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 70 to 90 days within the 4 months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the argillic horizon is 2 to 12 inches. The particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent clay with 35 to 50 percent rock fragments of mixed gravel, cobbles, and stones.  Lithology of rock fragments is dominantly water-rounded basalt with other igneous rock types.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam with 0 to 50 percent stones, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 5 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It has moderate or strong prismatic or blocky structure.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent and are dominantly gravel.  Carbonates may be present below 36 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dosie, Gurdane, Kishwalk, Mallory, Tablerock, and Thiessen soils.  Dosie soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric and have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches.  Gurdane, Kishwalk, Mallory, and Thiessen soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts and are dominated by angular and subangular rock fragments.  Tablerock soils have 80 to 110 consecutive dry days, have an O horizon, and are moderately well drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zweygardt soils are on side slopes of dissected, old fan terraces.  The stream dissections commonly run north or south and the side slopes are commonly east-facing or west-facing.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from mixed sources.  The rock fragments are dominantly water-rounded basalt with other igneous rock types.  Slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,600 to 3,400 feet, but may range to 4,600 on south-facing side slopes. The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., mean January temperature is 27 to 30 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."

The Oxwall and Oxbow soils are on old terrace fans and terrace shoulders with indurated duripans, and the argillic horizons of Oxwall and Oxbow soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  The Belshaw soils are on south-facing side slopes and flats, and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  The Tub soils are on north-facing side slopes and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Prill and Starkey are on south-facing side slopes over the John Day Formation or similar ashflow tuff bedrock.  Prill is moderately deep and in the fine family.  Starkey soils are shallow and are clayey-skeletal."
