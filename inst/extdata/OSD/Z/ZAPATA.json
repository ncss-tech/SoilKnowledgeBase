  "REVDATE": "05/2009",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zapata series consists of soils that are very shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. These are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy calcareous alluvium. These soils are on nearly level to undulating ridges on interfluves. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in).",
