  "OVERVIEW": "The Zerkel series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in stratified lacustrine and glacio-fluvial sediments on moraines.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the upper part and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower part. Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
