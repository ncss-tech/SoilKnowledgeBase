Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 0 to 4 percent of the profile by volume\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  The dry color has value of 5 or less and chroma of 3 or less.  Some pedons may have an Ap horizon as much as 9 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  When plowed, the E horizon may be completely incorporated within the plow layer.\nThe B/E horizon, has properties similar to the Bt and E horizons respectively.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam with thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam in some pedons.  It has distinct or prominent clay films on the faces of peds.
