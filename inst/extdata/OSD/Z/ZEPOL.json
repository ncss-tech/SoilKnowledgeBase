    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Goshen, Hall, Johnstown, Kinsell, Kuma, Lazarus, Mobridge, and Simpatico series.  Goshen, Hall, Johnstown, and Mobridge soils occur in the ustic moisture regime and are more moist in spring.  Kinsell soils have less than 5 percent glass and are deeper than 40 inches to the base of the argillic horizon. Kuma soils are moist in the spring and early summer months and have buried paleosols within 20 inches.  Lazarus soils do not have visible secondary carbonates. Simpatico soils are noncalcareous above 40 inches and have average annual soil temperatures that are dominantly less than 52 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zepol soils are on narrow flood plains of valley floors.  They formed in alluvium derived from Quaternary loess, volcanic ash, pumice, and basaltic tuff; and from Precambrian granite and schist.   Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,800 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Khapo soils are coarse-loamy, have ochric epipedons, and occur on toeslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Zia soils are coarse-loamy, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on low stream terraces."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nSurface mantle - The new alluvial material from the soil surface to a depth of about 6 inches. (AC1 and AC2 horizons)\nMollic epipedon (pachic feature) - The zone from 6 to about 27 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 6 to 46 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btk1, and Btk2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 6 to 26 inches (Bt1, Bt2, part of Bt3 horizon)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nNote:  This soil has minor amounts of volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions.  It is assumed that most of the volcanic glass derived from nearby Pleistocene ash eruptions has altered to more stable minerals like chalcedony.  In addition, Lincoln lab data indicates that ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum and iron percentages are low.  Zepol soils thus do not have the properties of the andic intergrades.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The series type location has full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S93NM-049-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
