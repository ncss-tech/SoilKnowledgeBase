  "OVERVIEW": "The Zane soils are reddish brown, well drained, weakly developed Sierozem soils that occur on the lower extremities of alluvial fans composed of moderately fine and medium textured sediments. Parent alluvium is derived from mixed igneous and sedimentary sources--rhyolite, andesite, basalt, and sandstone.\nThe Zane soils are adjacent to or immediately above the Penoyer soils and immediately below the Dixie series. The Penoyer soils are yellower in color (10YR hues) and lack B2 development; the Dixie series have moderate B2 development and have a weakly to strongly cemented Cca horizon. The Crestline soils are moderately coarse textured, and brown in color.\nZane soils are in a semiarid continental climate; average annual rainfall is 8 to 12 inches; average annual tempera-ture is 47 degrees F., average frost-free period is 115 to 135 days, and elevations range from 5,200 to 5,400 feet.",

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "VEGETATION & USE",
    "content": "VEGETATION: Sagebrush and galleta grass comprise the principal vegetative-coverage but in local areas almost pure stands of winterfat predominate. Fourwing saltbush and grasses grow rather sparsely on some areas. About 25 to 70 percent of the surface is barren. & USE: The soil is used almost entirely for range. Carrying capacity is variable, depending upon vegetative cover. Winterfat areas are much better than sagebrush and galleta grass. A few small areas west of Zane are being irrigated by pumping. Alfalfa, barley, and potatoes are being grown, and fair to good yields are reported."
