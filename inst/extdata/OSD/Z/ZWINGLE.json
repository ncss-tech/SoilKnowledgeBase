  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 36 to 60 inches.  Carbonates are leached to a depth of 48 inches or more and commonly to a depth of many feet.  The upper 36 inches of the solum contains less than 15 percent sand.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, except some pedons have an A horizon less than 5 inches thick with value of 3.  The A or Ap horizon is silt loam or, less commonly, silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bt horizon dominantly has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Thin strata or mixing of materials with hue of 10YR to 5Y or with chroma of 1 are in some pedons.  These colors are presumed to be inherited from the parent material.  The Bt horizon is silty clay or clay and averages 50 to 60 percent clay.  Thin horizons contain as much as 70 percent clay.  The B/A clay ratio is greater than 2.0.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.  The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe 2Cg horizon dominantly has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2.  Strata or mixing of materials with hue of 5Y to 5YR and chroma of 1 to 4 are within the range of the series.  The 2Cg horizon typically is loam with strata of loamy sand.  The size of the sand fraction commonly is medium but ranges from fine to coarse.  Some pedons contain thin gravel seams.  Pedons that are silty clay or clay to a depth of 60 inches or more are not excluded from the series."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ames, Beckwith, Dayton, Okaw, Rushville, and Wynoose soils of the same family and the Clanton and Marion soils.  All of these soils except Clanton lack B horizons with the reddish and pinkish colors.  The Clanton soils formed in acid red shales.  Ames, Beckwith, Rushville, and Wynoose soils also contain less clay in the finest part of the sola."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zwingle soils are on high stream terraces and foot slopes along major tributaries that drain into the Mississippi River.  Most have slopes with 0 to 2 percent gradients, but the range is from 0 to 10 percent.  Zwingle soils formed in old, dominantly reddish clayey lacustrine sediments 31/2 to 5 feet thick over stratified noncalcareous alluvial sediments that typically are loamy and sandy.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 32 to 35 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clinton, Fayette, Nordness, Sogn, and Volney soils, and soils of the first bottom lands.  Zwingle soils are downslope from Clinton, Fayette, Nordness, or Sogn soils.  Clinton and Fayette soils formed in loess and contain less clay in the Bt horizons.  Nordness and Sogn soils are shallow to limestone bedrock.  Near the mouth of side-valley drains, Zwingle soils are associated with Volney soils.  Volney soils are loamy-skeletal."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  More data are needed before the classification can be firm.  Even though the chroma in the upper part of the B horizon is 4, the soil is very wet.  Mineralogy is uncertain--  the soil may have sufficient shrink-swell potential for a  Vertic subgroup; and texture is marginal between very-fine and fine.\nADDITIONAL DATA: In Iowa and Minnesota, the native vegetative cover is a mixed herbaceous and woody community commonly inhabited with Green Ashes, American Elms, Common Hackberries, Eastern Cottonwoods, American Sycamores, Silky Dogwoods, Black Willows, Wild Black Currants, Riverbank Grapes, Grays Sedges, Hop Sedges, Virginia Wildryes, Stiff Bedstraws, White Avens, Wood Nettles, False Nettles, Canadian Clearweeds, and Common Bonesets.
