  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zapadni series consists of very deep, well-drained soils formed in sandy alluvial deposits with an admixture near the surface of medium textured material derived from scoria or other volcanic pyroclastics and basalt.  Zapadni soils are on strand lines occurring on footslopes of dipslopes of rocky uplands and on volcanic cones.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",
