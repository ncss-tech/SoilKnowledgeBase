    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zapadni soils formed in sandy alluvial deposits admixed in the upper part with finer textured material weathered from scoria and basalt.  They are formed on strand lines on dipslopes and volcanic cones near the coast.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Steeper areas of Zapadni soil may occur on the seaward side of the strand line.  The climate is cold maritime.  Mean annual air temperature is 35 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 28 inches."
