  "OVERVIEW": "The Zalvidea series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are now partially drained.  Zalvidea soils are on relic basin floors.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

The soil now has a water table at a depth of 5 feet or more.  The soils are still subject to rare flooding.  Some areas of this soil are subject to occasional very long periods of flooding between January and July when floodwaters from the Sierra Nevada mountains are diverted to designated basins.  During these times much of the area, in which these Zalvidea soils occur, is used as a temporary reservoir."
