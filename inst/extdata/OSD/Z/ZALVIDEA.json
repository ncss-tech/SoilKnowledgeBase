The mean annual temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  Mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F. and mean July temperature is about 85 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."

Fages soils are on similar landforms, are fine, and have an SAR of 45 to 120.  Garces and Tennco soils are on similar landforms and have a natric horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; very slow runoff; moderate or moderately slow permeability.  Zalvidea soils have been artificially drained by dams and levees.  The soil now has a water table at a depth of 5 feet or more.  The soils are still subject to rare flooding.  Some areas of this soil are subject to occasional very long periods of flooding between January and July when floodwaters from the Sierra Nevada mountains are diverted to designated basins.  During these times much of the area, in which these Zalvidea soils occur, is used as a temporary reservoir."
