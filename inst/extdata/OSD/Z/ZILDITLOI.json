  "OVERVIEW": "The Zilditloi series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone.  Zilditloi soils are on backslopes of escarpments on mountains.  Slopes are 35 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
