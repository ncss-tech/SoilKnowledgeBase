Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  However, some pedons have a thin A horizon with a chroma of l.  The A horizon is loam or clay loam.  It is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam in some pedons.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bk horizons has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 3 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has redox features in some pedons.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It does not have redox features in some pedons.  Some pedons have thin layers of gravel or gravelly sandy loam. Some pedons have shale bedrock below a depth of 40 inches."
