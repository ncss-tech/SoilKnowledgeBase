  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zau series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from shale and sandstone.  Zau series are on hills, mesas, plateaus, mountains, cuestas, and structural benches, and have slopes of 3 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
