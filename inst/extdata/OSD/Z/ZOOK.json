  "OVERVIEW": "The Zook series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and stream terraces in river valleys and in drainageways on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters.",
