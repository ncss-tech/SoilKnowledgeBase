  "OVERVIEW": "The Zzyzx series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium derived from igneous rock. The Zzyzx soils are on fan aprons and fan skirts. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C.",
