  "OVERVIEW": "The Zafarano series consists of deep well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from granite.  Zafarano soils are on hills.  Slopes are 35 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
