    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zafarano soils are on north-facing backslopes of hills. They formed in colluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist over residuum weathered from granite. Slopes are 35 to 60 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,600 to 9,200 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 17 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."
