  "OVERVIEW": "The Zark series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from vitric tuff.  Zark soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
