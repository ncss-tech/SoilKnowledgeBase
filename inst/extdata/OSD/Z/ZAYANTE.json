  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is over 80 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is about 56 degrees F.  The average summer soil temperature is about 60 degrees F.  The average winter temperature is about 46 degrees F.  The soils are moist in some or all parts between depths of 12 and 35 inches from mid-November until late May.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent in some part below the base of its mollic epipedon and above 1 meter.\nThe A horizon is very dark gray, dark gray, very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, grayish brown or brown in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  Moist value is 3 or less.  It ranges from sand to loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly to medium acid (pH 5.5 to 6.0). Organic matter is more than 1 percent below a depth of 20 inches.\nThe C horizon is dark grayish brown to pink, pinkish gray or very pale brown (10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3 and 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 6/2, 7/2, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4). It ranges from coarse sand to loamy fine sand.  Reaction is typically medium acid but ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.  Sediments in the substrata are loose to softly consolidated and consist of variably gravelly sand to loamy fine sand."

Arnold and Corralitos soils have ochric epipedons and are thermic.  Baywood and La Posta soils have a base saturation of more than 75 percent. Ben Lomond, Crafton and Crouch soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Burlington soils are neutral or slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Zayante soils are on sloping to very steep hills formed in marine and wind modified marine sediments and soft sandstone formations.  The elevations range from 250 to 1,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 70 inches.  The average annual temperature is from about 52 to 57 degrees F.; the average January temperature is about 38 to 40 degrees F.; and the average July temperature ranges from about 61 to 64 degrees F.  The average frost free season ranges from 170 to 240 days."

Vegetation is ponderosa pine, except on very steep northerly slopes where it is redwood.  Other vegetation is California live oaks, manzanita, ceanothus, madrone, poison oak , ferns, tanoak, laurel and few grasses and forbs."
