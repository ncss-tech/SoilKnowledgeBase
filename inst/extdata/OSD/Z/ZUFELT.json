The upper part from 25 to 84 cm is fine-loamy (loam). The lower part from 84 cm to 100 cm is sandy (sand) with weighted average rock fragments of 22 percent.\nEffervescence: slightly to strongly effervescent in the calcareous class control section,\nfrom a depth of 25 to 50 cm\nSoil temperature regime: cryic\nSoil moisture regime: aquic\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLab data from NSSL, Lincoln, NE:\nTypical pedon was not sampled.\nAdditional reference samples are PEDON ID S05-ID-081-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
