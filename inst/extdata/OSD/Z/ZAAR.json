  "STATES": "KS,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zaar series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey colluvium or residuum weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age. These soils are on interfluves and hillslopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).",
