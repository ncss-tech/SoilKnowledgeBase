  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zaar soils are on interfluves and hillslopes on plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent but is commonly between 1 and 4 percent. The soils formed in clayey colluvium or residuum weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age. The shale contains thin beds of limestone in some places. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 16 degrees C (57 to 63 degrees F). Elevation is 210 to 465 meters (685 to 1525 feet) above mean sea level. Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index ranges from 56 to 76."

Clareson, Eram, Kenoma, and Lula soils have an argillic horizon. Clareson, Eram, and Ringo soils have bedrock at depths less than 102 cm (40 inches). Girard soils are poorly drained and are in lower positions."
