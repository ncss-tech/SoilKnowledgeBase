  "OVERVIEW": "The soils of the Zaca series are deep, well-drained soils formed in material from weakly consolidated marine sediments. They are on gently rolling to very steep slopes. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F (16 degrees C).  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.",

Linne soils are less than 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and do not crack widely upon drying. Nacimiento soils have 25 to 35 percent clay and are less than 40 inches deep to paralithic contact. Santa Lucia soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments."
