They formed in softly consolidated marine sediments of mudstone, sandstone and shale. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and moist cool winters. Mean annual precipitation is 11 to 31 inches (280 to 838 millimeters). Average January temperature is 50 degrees F (10 degrees C).; average July temperature is 67 to 72 degrees F (19 to 22 degrees C).; mean annual temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F (14 to 17 degrees C).

Linne soils are less than 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and do not crack widely upon drying. Nacimiento soils have 25 to 35 percent clay and are less than 40 inches deep to paralithic contact. Santa Lucia soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments."
