The soils are usually moist but are dry in the control section for 45 to 70 consecutive days during the 4 month period following the summer solstice.  There are moist during the winter. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The solum is 30 to 45 inches thick.  It is moderately or strongly acid in the A and BA horizons and slightly acid or neutral in the 2Bt horizons.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 10 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5/Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4  moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue dominantly of 5 Y or 2.5Y but ranging to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4, with faint to distinct mottles having chroma of 2 through 6.  It is heavy silty clay loam, heavy clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  This horizon has weak or moderate prismatic to weak or moderate subangular or angular blocky structure.\nThe 2C horizon is olive, brown and grayish brown with common to many black stains and concretions and with faint to distinct high chroma mottles in some pedons.  It is loam or clay loam."

Gustin soils have ochric epipedons, have an E horizon and are very strongly to extremely acid in the B and C horizons.  The Linslaw soils have ochric epipedons, are strongly to very strongly acid in the B and C horizons and have a clayey 2C horizon that is finer than the B horizon.  Santiam soils have ochric epipedons, have a sola high in silt, the B horizon commonly has peds coated with clean silt and sand grains and have a clayey 2C horizon that is finer than the B horizon."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metamophic, granitic and basic igneous rocks.  The soils have subhumid climate with dry and warm summers and cool and wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 60 inches; the mean annual temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The frost free season is from 100 to 200 days."
