  "OVERVIEW": "The Zing series consists of very deep, moderately well or somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metamorphic, granite and basic igneous rocks.  They are on foot slopes and have slopes of 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry in the control section for 45 to 70 consecutive days during the 4 month period following the summer solstice.  There are moist during the winter. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The solum is 30 to 45 inches thick.  It is moderately or strongly acid in the A and BA horizons and slightly acid or neutral in the 2Bt horizons.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 10 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5/Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4  moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue dominantly of 5 Y or 2.5Y but ranging to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4, with faint to distinct mottles having chroma of 2 through 6.  It is heavy silty clay loam, heavy clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  This horizon has weak or moderate prismatic to weak or moderate subangular or angular blocky structure.\nThe 2C horizon is olive, brown and grayish brown with common to many black stains and concretions and with faint to distinct high chroma mottles in some pedons.  It is loam or clay loam."
