They formed in alluvium derived from Pennsylvanian Age limestone and sandstone over residuum weathered from limestone. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,200 to 8,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 9 inches. (Ak and ABk horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 9 to 24 inches. (Bk1 and 2Bk2 horizons). The upper boundary was placed at 9 inches because the most significant increase in carbonate content was judged to be at that depth.\nParalithic contact - Moderately cemented limestone bedrock at 24 inches. (2Crk layer)\nLithic contact - Indurated limestone bedrock at 29 inches. (2R layer)\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 24 inches (part of Bk1, Bk2 horizons)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 29 inches.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006..\nADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined using a calcimeter.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
