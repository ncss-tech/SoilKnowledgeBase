  "OVERVIEW": "The Zapa series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Zapa soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
