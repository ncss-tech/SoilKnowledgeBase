Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the series control section. Cobble content ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the A, E, and Bs horizon and from 0 to 10 in the E', E/B, and B/E horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. The E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. The Ap, A, and E horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or the cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The Bs horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe E/B horizons occur as separate E and Bt horizons or in combination. The E part has chroma of 2 or 3. The E part is loamy sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. The B part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4. The C horizon is sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a Cr horizon above the lithic contact. Thickness ranges from 2 to 10 inches."
