    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zacaton soils are on lower north-facing backslopes of mesas, undulating plateaus, and canyons.  They formed in colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation. Slopes are 25 to 50 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,500 to 7,100 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

The Navajita soils are fine-loamy, have an argillic horizon, do not have a calcic horizon, and occur on footslopes and toeslopes of valley sides"
