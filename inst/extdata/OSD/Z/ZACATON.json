  "OVERVIEW": "The Zacaton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff.  Zacaton soils are on lower north-facing backslopes of mesas, undulating plateaus, and canyons.  Slopes are 25 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
