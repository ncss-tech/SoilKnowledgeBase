  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zeomont series consists of deep, excessively drained soils on stabilized dunes and upland plains.  These soils formed in eolian sand derived dominantly from mixed sources.  Slopes are  2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches; and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is 40 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  The moisture control section is dry in all parts for at least 60 consecutive days and 90 cumulative days from July 15 to November 15.  The particle size control section is sand or loamy sand exclusive of loamy very fine sand.  The sand fraction is most commonly fine or medium sand.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loamy sand or sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lamarsh, Tusler, Yetull, and Zeona series.  Lamarsh soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Tusler soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Yetull soils are commonly calcareous throughout and always calcareous above 36 inches.  They occur in areas with more moist summers and have longer growing seasons.  Zeona soils are more moist and are not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 consecutive days and for 90 cumulative days between July 15 and November 15."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zeomont soils are on stabilized dunes and rolling upland plains.  Slopes are complex and slope gradients range from 2 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in noncalcareous, wind-deposited sandy material.  The mean annual temperature is about 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 90 to 110 days."
