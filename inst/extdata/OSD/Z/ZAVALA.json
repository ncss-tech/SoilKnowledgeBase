  "REVDATE": "11/2010",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zavala series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in loamy alluvium.  These frequently flooded soils are on nearly level to gently undulating flood plains in drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature range is 23 degrees C (72 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation range is 737 mm (29 in).",
