  "OVERVIEW": "The Zipp series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils on lake plains, lacustrine terraces and flood-plain steps. They formed in fine-textured lacustrine or slackwater sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

The very poorly drained Kings soils have a mollic epipedon, smectitic clay mineralogy and are in depressions. The well drained Markland and moderately well drained Shircliff soils are on rises, shoulders, and backslopes. The somewhat poorly drained McGary soils are on slightly higher lying flats. The poorly drained, less clayey Evansville soils are on treads of stream terraces. The very poorly drained Montgomery soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landform positions."

Undrained areas have an intermittent apparent high water table at the surface to a depth of  30 centimeters (1.0 foot) from November through May in normal years. This soil is subject to periods of frequent, brief ponding at depths up to 15 cm (0.5 foot) from December to May in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low or moderately low (0.07 to 0.42 micrometers/sec). Permeability is very slow (0.01 to 0.06 inches per hour). The potential for surface water runoff is low or negligible. This soil is subject to flooding in areas that are on a flood-plain step."

Limited data for COLE indicates the Linear Extensibility is less than 6.0 cm in the upper 100 cm of the soil."
