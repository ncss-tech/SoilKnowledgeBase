  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zipp soils are on level or slight depressions of lake plains and broad, slightly concave lacustrine terraces and flood-plain steps. They formed in fine-textured lacustrine or slackwater sediments. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (51 to 58 degrees F). The mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1219 mm (35 to 48 inches). Frost-free days range from 150 to 210. Elevation ranges from 104 to 244 meters (340 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Evansville, Kings, Markland, McGary, Montgomery and Shircliff soils. The very poorly drained Kings soils have a mollic epipedon, smectitic clay mineralogy and are in depressions. The well drained Markland and moderately well drained Shircliff soils are on rises, shoulders, and backslopes. The somewhat poorly drained McGary soils are on slightly higher lying flats. The poorly drained, less clayey Evansville soils are on treads of stream terraces. The very poorly drained Montgomery soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landform positions."

Undrained areas have an intermittent apparent high water table at the surface to a depth of  30 centimeters (1.0 foot) from November through May in normal years. This soil is subject to periods of frequent, brief ponding at depths up to 15 cm (0.5 foot) from December to May in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low or moderately low (0.07 to 0.42 micrometers/sec). Permeability is very slow (0.01 to 0.06 inches per hour). The potential for surface water runoff is low or negligible. This soil is subject to flooding in areas that are on a flood-plain step."

Limited data for COLE indicates the Linear Extensibility is less than 6.0 cm in the upper 100 cm of the soil.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data on pedon number S92IN123-004 is at the NSSC, Lincoln, NE. Additional data in on file at the Department of Agronomy, Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
