  "OVERVIEW": "The Zer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in  loess and slope alluvium mixed with colluvium from mixed sources.  Zer soils are on mountains, foothills, outwash fans, and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual  air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
