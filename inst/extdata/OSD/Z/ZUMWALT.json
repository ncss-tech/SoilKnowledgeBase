  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 70 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The solum is 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock.  An E horizon is commonly present in undisturbed areas.  The surface horizons have 5 to 30 percent glass with acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.2 to 0.5.  Secondary lime occurs at depths below 20 inches or is absent.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Organic matter decreases regularly to less than 1 percent below 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  It is ashy silt loam with 15 to 20 percent clay.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.  The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy silt loam with 15 to 20 percent clay.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.  The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Btss horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  The texture is clay or silty clay with 50 to 60 percent clay.  In some pedons, the upper part of the 2Btss horizon has a stone line of about 5 to 10 percent gravel.  The soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It has few or common slickensides.\nThe 2Btk and 2BC horizons have color and texture similar to the 2Btss horizon.  The 2Btk horizon has 0 to 2 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Zumwalt soils are on gentle side slopes of hills and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevations are 3,400 to 5,300 feet.  Zumwalt soils also occur as open areas adjacent to forestland at elevations of 4,000 to 6,000 feet. They havea mean annual precipitation of 12 to 35 inches.  The soils formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt or volcanic tuff.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Anatone soils are shallow and loamy-skeletal, and are on adjacent hills.  Harlow soils are shallow, clayey-skeletal, and are on adjacent shoulders of hills or plateaus.  Klicker soils are loamy-skeletal and are on forested south-facing side slopes.  Parsnip soils are shallow and are on ridgetops and plateaus.  Powwatka soils are fine-silty and are on adjacent benches and plateaus.  Snell soils are clayey-skeletal and are on north-facing side slopes.  Tolo soils are ashy, very deep to bedrock, and are on forested north-facing side slopes.  Wallowa soils are fine-loamy, lack argillic horizons, and occur as patterned ground on adjacent benches and hills."
