These soils formed in material from uplifted tephra buried by talus from basaltic lava flows.  Elevation is 4400 to 6800 feet.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches.  Snowfall is 70 to 96 inches.  The mean annual temperatures is 39 to 44 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F.

Dekkas soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, are very deep and are on outwash plains between basaltic lave flows.  Goulder soils are medial over loamy-skeletal are very deep and are on mountains and lava plateaus.  Scarface soils are fine-loamy, mixed, mesic; are very deep and are on lava plateaus and hills.  Typic Vitrixerands have a cambic horizon, vary from medial to medial-skeletal, vary from 20 to over 80 inches deep and are on slopes above Zeugirdor soils.  Wengler soils have cambic horizon are ashy-skeletal, are very deep and are on lava plateaus, hills and escarpments."
