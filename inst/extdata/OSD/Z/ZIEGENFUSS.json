    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ziegenfuss soils are on nearly level or depressional areas on till plains, wave-worked till plains, till-floored lake plains, end moraines, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in clayey ablation till overlying dense basal till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 960 mm. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 11 degrees C. Frost-free period is 110 to 210 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The moderately well drained Perrinton soils and the somewhat poorly drained Ithaca soils are in a drainage sequence with the Ziegenfuss soils. They are the common associates in MLRA 98. The somewhat poorly drained Blount and Arkona soils are common associates in MLRA 99. The Blount soils are on higher positions on the landscape. Arkona soils have 51 to 102 cm of sandy glaciofluvial deposits overlying clayey till or lacustrine deposits and are on higher positions on the landscape."
