  "REVDATE": "11/2016",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ziegenfuss series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that are deep to dense till. These soils formed in clayey ablation till overlying dense basal till. They are on till plains, wave-worked till plains, till-floored lake plains, end moraines, and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 832 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
