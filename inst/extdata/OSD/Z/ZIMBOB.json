Izod soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Kram soils have 50 to 70 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the less than 20 millimeter fraction and do not have horizons with identifiable secondary calcium carbonate.  Kyler soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October and have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C.  Logring soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October.  Tiki soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zimbob soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on all hillslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Small areas have parent materials derived from calcareous siltstone. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,550 to 2,680 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 275 to 350 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
