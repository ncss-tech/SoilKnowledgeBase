  "REVDATE": "12/2003",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zela series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in gravelly and sandy water laid deposits in  depressions on low beach ridges. Permeability is very rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
