  "OVERVIEW": "The Zumaridge soils consist of shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone. Zumaridge soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",
