  "OVERVIEW": "The Zymans series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with additions of loess and ash.  The Zymans soils are on mountains, hills, plateaus and rock pediments.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
