Correco soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in their argillic horizons, are slightly or medium acid, and are underlain by C horizons with loam or clay loam textures. Jasseek soils have less than 45 percent clay and have a discontinuity at 100 to 150 cm. Northmore soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in the argillic horizons textures are mainly sandy clay or sandy clay loam, and are underlain by sandy loam C horizons. Schoer soils have a lithologic discontinuity of very gravelly coarse sand within 150 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zymans soils are on mountains, hills, plateaus and rock pediments.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from volcanic rocks with additions of loess and volcanic ash. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 2,030 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."
