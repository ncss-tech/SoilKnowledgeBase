  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 65 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 3 percent throughout.  The particle size control section averages from 35 to 50 percent clay.  Unlimed soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid.  Redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less are at depths of 16 to 32 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.\nUndisturbed pedons commonly have an E horizon 3 to 6 inches thick with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam or clay.  Iron depletions and concentrations are present in the middle to lower part of the Bt horizon.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon that is gray and has redoximorphic features, and is 0 to 15 inches thick.  Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Varving is evident in the C horizon of some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Donlonton series is currently the only other competitor in the same family. Donlonton soils formed in old marine sediment on the Northern Atlantic Coastal Plain, contain moderate amounts of glauconite in the profile, and have texture of sandy clay or sandy clay loam in the Bt horizon.\nThe Licking, Tygart and Vincent series are in similar families.  Licking and Vincent soils have base saturation greater than 35 percent at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  The Tygart soils have evidence of wetness immediately below the Ap horizon."

The climate is humid temperate. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 49 degrees to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches.  Frost free days range from about 145 to 180."
