Lithology of fragments is volcanic rocks such as rhyolite.\nA horizons\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist.\nClay content: 8 to 18 percent.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nEffervescence: Noneffervescent through strongly effervescent.\nBt horizon\nValue:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist.\nTexture:  Gravelly clay loam, sandy clay loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam.\nClay content:  27 to 35 percent; some pedons may have more than 35 percent.\nRock fragments:  10 to 30 percent, mainly gravel.\nStructure:  Prismatic or subangular blocky.\nConsistence: Slightly hard or hard.\nReaction:  Slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nEffervescence:  Usually noneffervescent, but some pedons may be slightly effervescent or strongly effervescent in the lower part.\nBqk horizon\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture: Stratified very gravelly coarse sand to extremely gravelly sandy loam.\nClay content: 5 to 10 percent.\nRock fragments:  35 to 65 percent, mainly gravel.\nConsistence: Soft to hard, very friable to brittle.\nReaction:  Moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nEffervescence:  Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 15 to 30 percent.\nOther features: Some pedons have Bqk horizons above the hardpan with very gravelly to gravelly sandy loam or loam texture. This is a  result of degradation of the duripan."

Diawell soils have Bkq horizons above the duripan and have duripans at depths of 36 to 50 cm from the soil surface.  Mickey soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have duripans at depths of 36 to 50 cm from the soil surface.  Minu soils have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C.  Muni soils have duripans at depths of 36 to 50 cm from the soil surface and average less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
