The soil between the depths of 5 to 15 inches is moist in some or all parts from November until May and is dry in all parts the rest of the year.  The weighted average of clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent within the 10 to 40 inch control section and has more than 27 percent clay in some part.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 35 percent gravel throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/3, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2,or 7.5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 4/2, 3/3, 3/2, or 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4. Pedons with dark colors are both massive and hard within 7 inches of the surface.  It is clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/4, 4/3;  7.5YR 5/2, 5/6.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6.  It is loam, clay loam, gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, or 4/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Texture is loam, clay loam, gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly loam."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Zacharias soils occur on alluvial fans and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Elevations are 25 to 400 feet.  The climate is subhumid, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Mean annual January temperature is about 47 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 72 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 60 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 260 to 280 days."

Reiff soils have a coarse loamy control section and are on slightly lower topographic positions.  El Solyo soils are fine in the texture control section and are on basin rims.  Stomar soils have an argillic horizon and are on similar topographic positions.  The Capay soils have a fine textural control section, intersecting slickensides and are on basin rims.  Vernalis soils have soft powdery lime within 4 inches and are on slightly lower topographic positions."
