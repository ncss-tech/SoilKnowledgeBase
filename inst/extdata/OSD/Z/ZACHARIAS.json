  "OVERVIEW": "The Zacharias series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Zacharias soils are on alluvial fans and low stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The soil between the depths of 5 to 15 inches is moist in some or all parts from November until May and is dry in all parts the rest of the year.  The weighted average of clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent within the 10 to 40 inch control section and has more than 27 percent clay in some part.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 35 percent gravel throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/3, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2,or 7.5YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 4/2, 3/3, 3/2, or 7.5YR 3/2, 4/4. Pedons with dark colors are both massive and hard within 7 inches of the surface.  It is clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/4, 4/3;  7.5YR 5/2, 5/6.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6.  It is loam, clay loam, gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, or 4/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3.
