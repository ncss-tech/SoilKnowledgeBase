The IC horizon has value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry in the matrix.  Mottles have value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 0 through 4 moist.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry.  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand.

The soils formed in predominantly sandy lucustrine sediments weathered mainly from tuff, diatomite, and basalt.  The climate is warm and dry in summer and cold and moist in winter.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is about 45 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
