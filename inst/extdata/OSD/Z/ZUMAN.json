  "OVERVIEW": "The Zuman series consists of deep, poorly drained, sodic soils that formed in lacustrine sediments weathered mainly from tuff, diatomite, and basalt.  Zuman soils are on lakebeds or flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
