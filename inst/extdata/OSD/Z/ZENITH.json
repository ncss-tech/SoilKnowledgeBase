  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches.  Fragments, mostly channers or gravels, of sandstone, siltstone, or shale range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and from 0 to 60 percent in the substratum. Fragments commonly become larger with depth to include cobbles, flagstones, stones, and a few boulders in the lower horizons. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid, except the surface layer is less acid where limed or influenced by leaf fall from species such as yellow poplar.\nThe A or AB horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe BA or BE horizons (where present) have colors and textures similar to the upper part of the Bw horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC or CB horizons (where present) have colors and textures similar to the lower part of the Bw horizon.\nIn places, a C or 2C horizon is present that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. In other places, the 2C is replaced by 2BC and/or 2CB horizons with similar colors and textures. Lithochromic mottles in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray are common throughout. Fine-earth texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or clay loam."
