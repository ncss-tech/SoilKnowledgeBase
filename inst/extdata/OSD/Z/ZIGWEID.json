  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 8  inches.  Depth to the Bk horizon and the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 10 to 22 inches.  The particle-size control section and soil profile are clay loam or loam.  Clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 20 to 55 percent, and sand from 15 to 50 percent with more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 but are typically less than 5 percent and are mostly soft shale chips.  The moisture control section is usually dry in all parts for 90 cumulative days following the summer solstice and for 60 consecutive days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F. The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F.  or warmer for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has 5 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and may have a few scattered crystals of calcium sulfate.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with similar properties as the Bk horizon.  Some pedons may have sandy clay loam textures below 40 inches.  It typically has 3 to 5 percent less calcium carbonate than the overlying Bk horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on fan aprons, alluvial fans, terraces, fan piedmonts, fan remnants, ridges and hills.  In many areas they are dissected.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous, moderately fine textured sediments derived from interbedded shale and soft sandstone.  Elevations are 3,500 to 6,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 inches with over half of the annual precipitation falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October.  Precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F., and ranges from 43 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
