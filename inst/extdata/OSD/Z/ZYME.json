  "OVERVIEW": "The Zyme series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from shale.  Zyme soils are on ridges, knobs, and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
