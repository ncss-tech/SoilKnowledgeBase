  "OVERVIEW": "The Zenobia series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks predominantly on glaciated mountain slopes and moderate relief mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 105 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.   These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year (perudic).  Depth to bedrock and thickness of the umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to bedrock contact has andic soil properties with a weighted average of 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 35 to 50 percent for air dried samples.  Acid oxalate iron is 2.0 to 3.5 percent.  It has 20 to 40 percent organic matter decreasing with depth.  It has 2 to 8 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and value of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It is extremely gravelly medial silt loam, extremely cobbly medial silt loam, or extremely gravelly medial loam.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid."
