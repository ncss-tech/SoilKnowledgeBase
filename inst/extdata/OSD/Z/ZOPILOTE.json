  "OVERVIEW": "The Zopilote series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in debris flow deposits derived from sandstone and shale.  Zopilote soils are on debris flows.  Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.",
