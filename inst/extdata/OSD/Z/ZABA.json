  "OVERVIEW": "The Zaba series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in water deposited gravel and sands derived from mixed rocks.  Zaba soils are on beach plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 100 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
