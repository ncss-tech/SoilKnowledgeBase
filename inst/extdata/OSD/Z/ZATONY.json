  "OVERVIEW": "The Zatony series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived primarily from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, flood plain steps and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
