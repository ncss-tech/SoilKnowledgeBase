  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  Typically, free calcium carbonates are at the surface, but are leached from the upper few inches in some pedons in native grass.  Redoximorphic features are inherent from the parent material and vary widely in amount and intensity between pedons.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of less than 1.5.  It has a chroma of 2 in some cultivated pedons.  It typically is silt loam but is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in some pedons.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.  Some pedons have a thin Bw horizon.  The combined thickness of A and Bw horizons is less than 10 inches thick.\nThe Bk and Bky horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Few or common, fine or medium masses and threads of calcium carbonate are in the Bk horizon which has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 20 percent.  Few to many, fine or medium nests of gypsum are in most pedons.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam with thin lenses of finer or coarser textures in the lower part.  Some pedons are not distinctly laminated below depths of 16 to 20 inches.  The C horizon is slightly to strongly alkaline."

The soils formed in silty calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches.  Growing season is about 105 to 165 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3500.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 2350 feet."
