  "OVERVIEW": "The Zolotoi series consists of deep well-drained soils formed in pyroclastic deposits and gravelly basalt residuum.  Zolotoi soils are on dipslopes and wide valley bottoms.  Zolotoi soils are characterized by bimodal pedons consisting of hummock and interhummock.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic layers and features recognized in this profile include: Andic properties in at least 60 percent of the thickness between the mineral soil surface and 24 inches depth.  Soil is assumed to have greater than 2.0 cmol/Kg Al3+ in a layer at least 10 cm thick between 25 and 50 cm depth.  In the mineralogical control section 8 times the sum of silica plus 2 times the iron (percents by weight by acid oxalate) equals 5 or more and 8 times the silica is more than 2 times the iron.  A lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches depth; a cryic temperature regime; and a weighted average substitute particle size class of medial.  Assignation to the Alic Haplocryands subgroup is tentative.  Properties with significant bimodal expression include coarse fragment content at the surface and depth to bedrock.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
