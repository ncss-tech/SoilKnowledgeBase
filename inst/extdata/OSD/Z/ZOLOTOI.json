Stone content of the O horizon in the interhummock ranges from 15 to 65 percent. Rock fragment content in the organic mat of the hummock is less than 10 percent. The weighted average particle size of the control section is silt loam. The thin band of extremely smeary 5YR 4/4 silt loam described as the 3C2 horizon consistently overlies the 4C3 horizon.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid through the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value moist of 2.5 or 3; and chroma moist of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam, cobbly silt loam, very cobbly silt loam, stony silt loam, very stony silt loam, or extremely stony silt loam. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 35 percent, cobble content ranges from 0 to 45 percent, and stone content ranges from 0 to 65 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value moist of 3 or 4, chroma moist of 2, 3 or 4.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent, cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent, and stone content ranges form 0 to 10 percent.   Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 7.5YR, 10YR; value moist of 3 or 4, chroma moist of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam, gravelly silt loam, very fine sandy loam, gravelly very fine sandy loam. Gravel content is 0 to 25 percent; cobble content is 0 to 10 percent.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic layers and features recognized in this profile include: Andic properties in at least 60 percent of the thickness between the mineral soil surface and 24 inches depth.  Soil is assumed to have greater than 2.0 cmol/Kg Al3+ in a layer at least 10 cm thick between 25 and 50 cm depth.  In the mineralogical control section 8 times the sum of silica plus 2 times the iron (percents by weight by acid oxalate) equals 5 or more and 8 times the silica is more than 2 times the iron.  A lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches depth; a cryic temperature regime; and a weighted average substitute particle size class of medial.  Assignation to the Alic Haplocryands subgroup is tentative.  Properties with significant bimodal expression include coarse fragment content at the surface and depth to bedrock.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
