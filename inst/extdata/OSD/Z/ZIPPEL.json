  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 18 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 10 inches.   The A horizon in some pedons is slightly thinner, but the upper 7 inches after mixing qualifies as a mollic epipedon.  These soils typically contain free carbonates throughout, but some pedons do not have free carbonates in the upper 5 to 10 inches.  These soils have less than 3 percent rock fragments.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loamy very fine sand. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, loam, or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Cg horizon has the same range of textures as the Bg horizon and is stratified in some pedons with these textures.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

They formed in calcareous silty and loamy lacustrine sediments of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.  The frost free period is 100 to 140 days."

Competing series and other updates will be made later.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to CFC #3745 of University of Minnesota Soil Survey Laboratory for data from typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
