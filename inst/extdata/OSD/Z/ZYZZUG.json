  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist and is saturated with water for several months each year when not artificially drained. It is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The particle-size control section is 25 to 35 percent clay and has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Redox depletions are with 10 inches of the mineral surface.  Redox features are faint to distinct in the solum and distinct to prominent in the substratum. The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick and is strongly acid or moderately acid. Hue is 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry. Texture is silt loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.\nThe Bg horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist, 2 to 6 dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. It has common to many redox concentrations.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 45 percent clay. It has common to many redox concentrations and depletions.\nThe BC horizon has characteristics similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist or dry. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. It is stratified in some pedons with thin discontinuous lenses of coarser material in the lower C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zyzzug soils occur in shallow swales and concave depressions on low stream terraces. These soils formed in mixed silty alluvium derived from sedimentary and volcanic rock types. Elevations are 50 to 800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 50 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 220 days. Zyzzug soils occur on the Tenmile geomorphic surface in Coos and Curry Counties, and in depressional areas on low stream terraces in Benton County."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eilertsen, Gardiner, Kirkendall, Meda, Quosatana, Treharne, and Wasson soils. Eilertsen soils occur on low stream terraces, are well drained, and have an argillic horizon. Gardiner, Kirkendall, and Quosatana soils occur on flood plains. Gardiner soils have an ochric epipedon and are sandy. Kirkendall soils are well drained. Meda soils are well drained, fine-loamy, and occur on alluvial fans. Quosatana soils are nonacid and have an irregular decrease in organic-carbon content. Wasson soils are coarse-loamy and have an irregular decrease in organic-carbon content. Treharne soils are moderately well drained, have an argillic horizon, and occur on low stream terraces."
