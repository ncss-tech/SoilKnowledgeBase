  "OVERVIEW": "The Zioncreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terraces.  They formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed in the surface layers.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",
