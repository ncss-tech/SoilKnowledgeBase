    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zioncreek soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with  minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed in the surface layers.  Elevation ranges from 2,100 to 2,400 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 32 inches and average annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."
