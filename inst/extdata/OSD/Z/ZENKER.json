    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The 10- to 40- inch particle-size control section is 20 to 27 percent clay and averages 35 to 80 percent weathered sandstone fragments.  Average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  Organic carbon is less than 4 percent in some part of the 2/3's of the particle-size control section.  The umbric epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches in thickness.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to extremely acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  It has 0 to 70 percent pebble-size weathered sandstone fragments.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist or dry.  It has 20 to 70 percent pebble-size weathered sandstone fragments.  Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 dry and moist.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction."

Similar soils in other families are the Bear Prairie, Calawah, Cinebar, Elochoman, Le Bar, Lytell, Mossyrock, Newaukum, Quillayute and Trouter series.  Bear Prairie, Mossyrock and Quillayute soils have an umbric epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Calawah, Cinebar, and La Bar soils lack rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Elochoman soils are 27 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Cinebar, Mossyrock, Newaukum and Trouter soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Newaukum soils have 5 to 30 percent hard rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Lytell soils have firm shot-sized concretions in the upper part of the particle-size control section, moderate or strong structure in the Bw horizon and 27 to 35 percent apparent clay in the control section.  Trouter soils also have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

Elevation ranges from 50 to 1,700 feet.  These soils formed from sandstone.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and relatively cool summers.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 120 inches.  The average January temperature is 37 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 62 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.
