  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 50 to 70 inches.\nThe A horizon averages between 10 and 15 percent clay and 8 to 12 percent very fine sand.  It ranges from slightly acid through very strongly acid.  The A1 or Ap horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), light gray (10YR 5/1), or dark gray (10YR 4/1).  The A2 horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2).  Mottles are few to common in shades of brown.  Total thickness of the A1 or Ap and A2 horizon is 24 to 40 inches.\nThe B2t horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/2; 2.5Y 5/1; 5Y 5/1, 6/1), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), light olive gray (5Y 6/2), or olive gray (5Y 5/2) silty clay loam.  Mottles, where present, are in shades of brown.  The B2t horizon averages between 27 and 35 percent clay and 10 to 15 percent very fine sand.  The clay content of the B2t horizon is at least twice as much as that of the A2 horizon.  The clay increase occurs within a vertical distance of 2 inches or less.  The B2t horizon is medium acid through very strongly acid.\nThe B3 horizon is silty clay loam or silt loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. Other similar series are the Calhoun, Crowley, Frost, Guyton, Henry, Waverly, and Wrightsville series.  Calhoun soils have an A horizon less than 24 inches thick.  Calhoun, Frost, Guyton, and Wrightsville soils have tonguing of the A2 horizon into the argillic horizons.  Crowley and Wrightsville soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Henry soils lack an abrupt change in texture between the A and B horizon and have a fragipan.  Waverly soils lack a Bt (argillic) horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zachary soils are on nearly level flood plains within reach of present flood stages except where protected by levees.  The thick A horizon is considered to be the result of slow accumulation of alluvium.  The regolith is silty sediments washed from soils formed in late Pleistocene alluvium or aeolian deposits.  Mean annual temperature at the type location is about 68 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches."
