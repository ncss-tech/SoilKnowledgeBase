  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the densic material consisting of very compact glacial till is 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. These soils are saturated during the winter and early spring. Redox depletions with a chroma of 2 or less are at a depth of less than 20 inches. Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 5 to 30 percent in individual horizons and are dominantly gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry; chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Structure is subangular blocky or angular blocky. Most areas of this soil have been logged causing surface layer disturbance.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry. Texture is silt loam or gravelly silt loam. Structure is angular blocky or prismatic. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid. Some pedons have a C horizon.\nThe 2Cd horizon is very compact lodgment till that crushes to gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam. It has hue of 2.5Y and 5Y moist and dry, and value of 4 or 5 moist."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zeeka soils are on glaciated hills at elevations from 30 to 800 feet. They formed in loess and ablation till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and basalt over dense very compact lodgment till. These soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters. Average annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches. Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F., average July temperature is about 59 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 220 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kydaka, Ozette, Palix, and Snahopish soils. Kydaka soils have an aquic moisture regime and matrix chroma of 2 in the subsoil and are in depressional areas. Ozette soils are moderately well drained, have an umbric epipedon, have densic contact at between 40 and 60 inches. Snahopish soils are well-drained and formed in sandstone residuum and colluvium on mountainsides. ."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; medium runoff; permeability is moderately slow above the densic contact. The very slowly permeable Cd horizon restricts downward water movement causing a perched water table during the winter and early spring."

Further investigation of this series is warranted for separation from or correlation to nearby poorly drained Kydaka soils.\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and other features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
