Abalan have carbonates at 8 to 20 cm.  Alcan soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 12 to 14 degrees C.  Bouncer soils are not dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter rock fragments.  Armoine and Stodick soils are 36 to 50 cm to bedrock.  Entero soils have less than 45 percent sand in Bt horizon and the rock fragments are mostly greater than 5 millimeters.  Berit, Flex, Ginex, Sedsked, Soar, and Stodick soils lack summer moisture. Harvan soils have densic materials at 30 to 50 cm.  Penelas soils have less than 35 percent sand. Ravenell soils have a B2t horizon with 35 to 45 percent clay and gravel that are dominantly from 5 to 75 millimeters in diameter."
