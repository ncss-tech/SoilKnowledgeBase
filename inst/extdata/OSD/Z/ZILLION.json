  "OVERVIEW": "The Zillion series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from basic and intermediate igneous rocks, limestone, and sandstone.  Zillion soils are on dissected fan terraces and mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches (38 cm) and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F (6.1 degrees C).",
