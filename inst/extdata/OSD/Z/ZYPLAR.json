  "OVERVIEW": "The Zyplar series consists of shallow and very shallow, well-drained soils that formed in residuum of rhyolitic ash-fall tuff. Zyplar soils are on pediments.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",
