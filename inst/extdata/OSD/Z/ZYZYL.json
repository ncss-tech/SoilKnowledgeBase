  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zyzyl soils are on ridgetops and backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from highly chloritized Eocene marine basalt along the southern edge of the Olympic Mountains.  Elevations range from 600 to 1,800 feet.  They are in a humid marine climate with cool, wet winters and relatively cool, dry summers.  The annual precipitation ranges from 120 to 180 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.0 is 200 to 240 days."
