Depth to the 2C horizon exceeds 40 inches.\nThe A horizon, and AB horizon when present, has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Texture is silt loam or sandy loam.  Distinct or prominent redox features are in the lower part. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon with value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has distinct or prominent redox features.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.Texture is silt loam, sandy loam or very fine sandy loam and has thin lenses of loamy sand in the lower part. It has distinct or prominent redox features.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has the same color range as the C horizon. Texture is loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly coarse sand."

Fontanelle soils have a buried A horizon between 24 and 60 inches.  Esquatzel soils lack an aquic moisture regime and mottles. Kittitas soils are fine, silty. Onyx soils lack an aquic moisture regime and mottles and have a dry value of 5 or less throughout.
