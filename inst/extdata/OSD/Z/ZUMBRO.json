  "STATES": "IL,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zumbro series consists of deep well and moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy postglacial alluvium on high flood plains and low terraces.  These soils have rapid permeability.  Their slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 26 to 60 inches.  The solum and C horizon contain less than 5 percent free carbonates.  Depth to free carbonates typically is 20 to 60 inches, but a trace is at shallower depths in some pedons.  Content of gravel in the solum and C horizon ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume; commonly the upper part of the solum lacks gravel.  The gravel is of mixed mineralogy and typically less than 1 cm in diameter.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 50 inches in thickness.  The average texture between depths of 10 to 40 inches is loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2 in the upper part and value of 3 and chroma of 2 in the lower part.  It has mottles in the lower part in some pedons.  It typically is loamy sand or loamy fine sand but in some pedons the upper part of this horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It typically is neutral or mildly alkaline, but slightly or medium acid is in the range.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR and value and chroma of 2 through 4.  It has mottles in some pedons.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 through 5.  It has mottles in some pedons.  It typically is sand or fine sand, but coarse sand is in the range.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

They have plane or slightly concave slopes with gradient of less than 2 percent.  The Zumbro soils formed in sandy post glacial alluvium that is several feet thick.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 27 to 34 inches."
