    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zibetod soils are on footslopes and shoulders of domes. They formed in eolian, residuum, and alluvium derived from Cretaceous sandstone and siltstone, and Tertiary quartz diorite. Slopes are 15 to 35 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,500 to 9,400 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms. The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
