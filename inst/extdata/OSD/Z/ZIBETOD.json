  "STATES": "AZ,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zibetod series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to sandstone. Zibetod soils formed in eolian, residuum and alluvium from sandstone, siltstone, and quartz diorite. They are on footslopes and shoulders of domes. Slopes are 15 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 43 degrees F.",
