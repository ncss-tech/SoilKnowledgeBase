These soils formed in residuum of volcanic flow rock, tuff, and quartzitic bedrock. Slopes are 8 to 90 percent. Elevations are 3,400 to 5,300 feet. The climate is mild, arid with warm dry summers and cold winters. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches; mean annual temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F., and the frost- free season is 180 to 220 days."
