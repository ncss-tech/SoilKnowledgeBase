  "OVERVIEW": "The Zibate series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum of volcanic flow rock, tuff and quartzite. Zibate soils are on hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
