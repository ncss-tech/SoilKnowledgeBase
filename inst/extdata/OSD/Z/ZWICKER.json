  "OVERVIEW": "The Zwicker series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from calcareous shale.  Zwicker soils are on knobs, ridges, and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
