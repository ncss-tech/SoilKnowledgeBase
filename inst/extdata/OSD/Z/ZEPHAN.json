  "OVERVIEW": "The Zephan series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolite and altered andesite.  Zephan soils are on plateaus, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
