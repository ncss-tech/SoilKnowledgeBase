The soil has from 1 to 10 percent coarse fragments throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It is neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam or clay averaging from 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It is mottled in some pedons.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam with 30 to 45 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is mottled in most pedons.   Pedons have either a Bk horizon or Btk horizon or both.  The Btk horizon, where present, is clay loam or clay averaging from 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is up to 10 inches thick.  It has other properties similar to that of the Bk horizon.\nThe BCk and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are clay loam with 30 to 45 percent clay.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not have C horizons."

Fughes and Hillery soils do not have horizons of carbonate accumulation within about 60 inches.  In addition, Hillery soils have greater than 50 percent clay in the control section.  Grail soils do not have coarse fragments.  Kubler soils have color hues of 7.5YR and redder.  The Pagoda soils have a soil moisture control section that is usually dry from May 15 to June 15.  Zoltay soils have more than 15 percent coarse fragments."
