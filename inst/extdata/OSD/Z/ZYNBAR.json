    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is dominantly gravelly silt loam and contains 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments by volume.  Moist and dry hue is 7.5YR or 10YR.\nThe Ac and A horizons have value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and moist.  They have weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  They are neutral to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist.  It is loam, silt loam or gravelly silt loam.  Some pedons have a C horizon similar to the Bw horizon.  Below 40 inches some pedons have very gravelly silt loam, very gravelly loam or extremely stony silt loam C horizons.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid."

The soils formed in material high in volcanic ash and basic igneous colluvium.  The climate is marine with average annual precipitation of 70 to 100 inches consisting mainly of heavy winter rains and snowfall.  Average annual temperature is 44 degrees F.; average January temperature is 30 degrees F.; and average July temperature is 60 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 100 to 190 days."

Bromo, Cispus and Cotteral soils are pumiceous or ashy-pumiceous in the upper control section.  Also, Cispus soils have a mesic soil temperature and Cotteral soils are cryic.  Cinebar and Newaukum soils have an umbric epipedon and have a mesic soil temperature regime."
