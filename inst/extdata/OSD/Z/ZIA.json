(A Horizon) When colors meet the requirements of a mollic epipedon, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick.\nSome pedons of this series (including the typical pedon) appear to have a cambic horizon, and hence a Haplocambids class. This needs investigation, particularly the degree of stratification and the presence of secondary carbonates.\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
