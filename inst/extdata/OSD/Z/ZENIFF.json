  "OVERVIEW": "The Zeniff series consists of very deep, well-drained, soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sandstone and Tertiary sediments from sandstone, shale, and granitic rocksZeniff soils are on secondary or slightly elevated flood plains adjacent to intermittent stream channels. Slopes are 1 to 10 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

Manuelito soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Savoia soils are inactive. Vibo soils receive less than 16 inches of precipitation and mean annual temperature are above 49 degrees and are in LRR-E."

The Zeniff soils occur at elevations between 5,500 and 6,500 feet where the climate is continental, summers mild, winters cool, the January average temperature 35 degrees F., July 70 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature 50 degrees F.  The growing season averages 117 days, and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Zeniff and Showlow soils are associated geographically.  Showlow soils differ in having more distinct textural profiles with strong contrast between A and B horizons, and with thick continuous clay films on ped surfaces in the B horizon.  Their B horizons are usually of hue 2.5YR or 5YR.  Heber and Leonard soils are developing in parent materials similar to those of Zeniff, but are Alluvial soils, lacking textural B horizons."

A small portion of this soil is used for dry farming with grain being produced; a few areas are irrigated where alfalfa, grain and vegetables are produced and very good yields reported.  The rest is used for range and the carrying capacity is good. Some juniper, ponderosa pine with considerable blue and hairy grama, some weeds and herbs."
