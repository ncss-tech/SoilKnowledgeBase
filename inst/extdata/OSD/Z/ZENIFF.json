  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Herrada (NM), Manuelito (NM), Savoia (NM), Vibo (NM) and Zunalei (NM) series. Herrada soils have a lithic contact at 91 inches. Manuelito soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Savoia soils are inactive. Vibo soils receive less than 16 inches of precipitation and mean annual temperature are above 49 degrees and are in LRR-E."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Smooth, gently sloping with about half of the area having less than 1 percent slopes, nearly half having 1 to 3 percent, and a small portion with slopes between 3 and 10 percent. The Zeniff soils occur at elevations between 5,500 and 6,500 feet where the climate is continental, summers mild, winters cool, the January average temperature 35 degrees F., July 70 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature 50 degrees F.  The growing season averages 117 days, and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Zeniff and Showlow soils are associated geographically.  Showlow soils differ in having more distinct textural profiles with strong contrast between A and B horizons, and with thick continuous clay films on ped surfaces in the B horizon.  Their B horizons are usually of hue 2.5YR or 5YR.  Heber and Leonard soils are developing in parent materials similar to those of Zeniff, but are Alluvial soils, lacking textural B horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is very slow to slow depending upon vegetative cover, slope, and amount of moisture in the soil; permeability is moderate."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for range or pasture. A small portion of this soil is used for dry farming with grain being produced; a few areas are irrigated where alfalfa, grain and vegetables are produced and very good yields reported.  The rest is used for range and the carrying capacity is good. Some juniper, ponderosa pine with considerable blue and hairy grama, some weeds and herbs."
