  "REVDATE": "01/2001",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zalda series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to a thin duripan over bedrock. Zalda soils are on low hill summits and crests.  Zalda soils formed in residuum from igneous rocks, with a component of eolian material. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

Muroc soils have a duripan over soft weathered granitic rock, and have sandy loam or coarse sandy loam textures, and contain fine pebbles from decomposed granite."

The soils formed in residuum from rhyolitic ash fall tuffs and igneous flow rocks with a component of eolian materials.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.   Elevations are 2,500 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool winters, typical of the Move Desert.  The average annual precipitation is between 3 and 10 inches; the average annual temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F., and the frost-free season  210 days."
