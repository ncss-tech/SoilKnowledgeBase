Muroc soils have a duripan over soft weathered granitic rock, and have sandy loam or coarse sandy loam textures, and contain fine pebbles from decomposed granite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zalda soils are on low hill summits and crests. The soils formed in residuum from rhyolitic ash fall tuffs and igneous flow rocks with a component of eolian materials.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.   Elevations are 2,500 to 4,200 feet.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool winters, typical of the Move Desert.  The average annual precipitation is between 3 and 10 inches; the average annual temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F., and the frost-free season  210 days."
