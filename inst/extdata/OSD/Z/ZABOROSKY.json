    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Algansee, Altmar, Brems, Deerfield, Elnora, Fortress, Livonia, Morocco, Ottokee, Partridge, and Tedrow series.  Algansee soils have subhorizons with more than 5 percent clay in the lower two parts of the series control section.  Altmar soils have a weighted average of more than 10 percent coarse fragments at depths of 10 to 40 inches.  Brems soils do not have 2 chroma mottles above a depth of 24 inches.  Deerfield, Elnora, and Morocco soils do not have free carbonates within a depth of 60 inches.  Fortress soils have a mantle of human transported material that is 100 to 200 cm thick. Livonia soils have a surface mantle of human transported material that is 50 cm or less thick and no surface mantle of new soil material from  eolian transport. Ottokee soils have lamellae with 3 to 5 percent more clay than the intervening horizons (E & Bt) in the third part of the series control section.  Partridge soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Tedrow soils have value of 4 or more in the second part of the series control section."
