  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zono soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in rhyolitic volcanic ash over residuum weathered from granitic, dacitic, or basaltic rock.  The source of the airfall (eolian) volcanic ash are the adjacent Mono Craters.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,075 to 2,445 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 5.6 to 7.8 degrees C.  Mean January temperature is about -1 degrees C. and mean July temperature is about 19.4 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 125 days."

Brantel soils are very deep, do not have strongly contrasting loamy material within a depth of 100 cm, and are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, and hills.  Cowtrack soils have a frigid soil temperature regime and occur at higher elevations."
