  "OVERVIEW": "The Zono series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in rhyolitic volcanic ash over residuum weathered from granitic, dacitic, or basaltic rock.  Zono soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm inches and the mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C.",

These soils formed in rhyolitic volcanic ash over residuum weathered from granitic, dacitic, or basaltic rock.  The source of the airfall (eolian) volcanic ash are the adjacent Mono Craters.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,075 to 2,445 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 5.6 to 7.8 degrees C.  Mean January temperature is about -1 degrees C. and mean July temperature is about 19.4 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 125 days."
