Elevations range from 7000 to 7600 feet. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. The frost free period is 90 to 110 days. The Zaster soils generally occur on drier east and south facing slopes promoting mesic soil temperatures and a pinyon pine-juniper woodland"
