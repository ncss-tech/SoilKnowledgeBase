  "OVERVIEW": "The Zaster series consists of moderately deep to dolomitic limestone, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and limestone. Zaster soils are on escarpments. Slopes range from 10 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
