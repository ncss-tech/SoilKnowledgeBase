Elevations range from 6200 to 6500 feet. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. This soil receives several inches additional moisture through capillary rise and as run-on from adjacent areas. The frost free period is 120 to 140 days."
