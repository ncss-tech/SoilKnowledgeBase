Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,270 to 3,000 meters. The climate is subhumid, continental with cold, snowy winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, most of which is snow. Mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
