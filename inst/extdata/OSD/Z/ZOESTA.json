  "OVERVIEW": "The Zoesta series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed rocks. Zoesta soils are on summits and side slopes of mountain valley fan remnants, partial ballenas and mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
