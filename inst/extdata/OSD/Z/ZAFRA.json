  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 56 inches and depth to hard rock ranges from 25 to 60 inches.  The coarse fragments are angular pieces of hard and soft sandstone with minor amounts of shale.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark brown (10YR 3/3, 4/3), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam and ranges from medium acid through strongly acid.  Coarse fragments more than 3 inches diameter make up 0 to 2 percent of the volume, and those less than 3 inches diameter make up 5 to 20 percent.\nThe E horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), brown (10YR 5/3), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), or reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6).  Texture, reaction, and coarse fragments are similar to that of the A horizon.\nThe BE horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8), yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 5/8), or reddish yellow (5YR 6/6, 6/8).  It is loam or gravelly loam.  Coarse fragments larger than 3 inches diameter make up 0 to 2 percent of the volume, and those smaller than 3 inches make up 10 to 25 percent of the volume.\nThe Bt1 horizon is brown (7.5YR 4/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8), or red (2.5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8).  It is gravelly or very gravelly loam, gravelly or very gravelly clay loam, gravelly or very gravelly sandy clay loam.  Coarse fragments larger than 3 inches diameter make up 0 to 5 percent of the volume, and those less than 3 inches diameter make up 35 to 70 percent of the volume.\nThe Bt2 horizon is yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8) or strong brown (7.5YR 5/6, 5/8).  Texture and coarse fragments are similar to those in the B2t horizon and includes gravelly and very gravelly sandy laom.\nThe Cr horizon is shades of red, brown, and yellow soft sandstone with thin alternating beds of shale and hard sandstone.\nThe R layer is hard sandstone with thin layers of shale and soft sandstone tilted at 20 to 60 degrees from horizontal."

Apison, Cahaba, Durham, Granville, Hartsells, Kalmia, Maxton, Shermore, and Sherwood soils have less than 35 percent fragments larger than 2 mm in the Bt horizons.  Bigfork soils are underlain by hard chert.  Bodine, Holston, and Ruston soils have sola thicker than 60 inches and in addition Holston and Ruston soils lack coarse fragments.  Lillington soils have sola more than 60 inches thick.  Lockhart soils have mixed mineralogy and the coarse fragments are primarily feldspar. Mountainburg soils have sola less than 20 inches over hard rock. Saffell and Sublinga soils lack bedrock within 60 inches.  In addition, Saffell soils have Bt horizons with more than 35 percent fragments of quartz, chert, or hard siliceous materials."

Shermore and Sherwood soils occur on similar positions of the landscape.  Carnasaw soils occur on similar positions of the landscape and they have fine control sections.  Clebit and Pickens soils occur on ridgecrests and have solums 10 to 20 inches thick.  Pirum soils occur on similar positions of the landscape and they have less than 35 percent fragments of shale or sandstone.  Stapp soils occur on concave areas and have fine control sections.\nDrainage and Permeability:  Zafra soils are well drained.  Runoff is medium to rapid and permeability is moderate."
