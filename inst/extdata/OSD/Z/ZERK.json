  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zerk soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, inset fans, beach plains, barrier beaches, and spits.  These soils formed mainly in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Wave-modified fan alluvium forms a portion of the parent material where this series occurs on lacustrine landforms.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 1,710 to 1,950 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
