  "OVERVIEW": "The Zenor series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in glacial outwash on uplands and, less commonly, on stream benches.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Zenor soils usually are slightly acid or neutral in the solum, and they range to moderately acid in the upper part and to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Volume of gravel ranges from 4 to 15 percent in the solum.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon typically has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam or loam.\nThe AB horizon is dark brown (10YR 3/3) or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) and commonly has mixing of brown (10YR 4/3).  The AB horizon is lacking in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon is brown (10YR 4/3) and dark yellowish brown 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The BC horizon has slight or strong effervescence in most pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand, or gravelly sand, with silt lenses in some pedons."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Becker, Bertram, Bolan, Carmi, Dickinson, Etter, Flagler, Olin, and Ridgeport series in the same family and the Estherville, Salida, and Wadena series.  Becker soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 24 inches.  Bertram soils have limestone within a depth of 40 inches.  Bolan and Dickinson soils lack pebbles in the solum and have thicker sola.  Carmi soils have 7.5YR or 5YR hues in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizon and have as much as 70 percent gravel below the control section.  Etter soils have sandstone within a depth of 40 inches.  Flagler soils lack carbonates within a depth of 6 feet.  Olin soils have loamy texture in the lower part of the solum and C horizon.  Ridgeport soils have more sand and less clay in the solum.  Estherville and Wadena soils have a contrasting texture within a depth of 40 inches.  Salida soils have a thinner solum and are shallower to carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zenor soils typically occupy upland outwash areas.  A few areas are on stream benches.  Slopes are convex and typically 5 to 9 percent but range from 2 to 30 percent.  They formed in poorly sorted glacial deposits that are dominantly sandy loam over loamy sand.  The deposits are many feet thick, increasing in content of sand with depth.  Mean annual temperature is approximately 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 30 to 34 inches."

The Clarion and Stoden soils are finer textured and formed entirely in glacial till.   Pilot Grove soils have glacial till starting at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Salida soils do not have a loamy upper mantle or have a thinner loamy upper mantle."
