  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 34 degrees F.  The mat of organic matter consists of partially decomposed forest litter 1 to 5 inches thick.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 3 to 20 inches.  Thickness of the silty micaceous loess mantle and depth to the contrasting sandy material ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Texture of the upper part of the particle size control section is dominantly silt loam but ranges to include very fine sandy loam.  The upper control section has less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Texture of the lower part of the control section is fine or medium sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction throughout the profile ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value from 2 to 4; and chroma from 1 to 4.\nThe E horizon, where present, has value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR; value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma moist from 4 to 8.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue from 10YR to 5Y; value from moist 4 to 6; and chroma moist from 4 to 8.\nThe 2C horizon has hue from 10YR to 5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist from 2 to 6.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or medium sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zitziana soils formed in a thin mantle of micaceous silty loess which overlies eolian sand deposits.  Zitziana soils are on the backslopes, shoulders, and crests of stabilized sand dunes. These dunes are present on large alluvial plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches and includes a mean annual snowfall of about 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 24 to 28 degrees F."

Beales soils are on similar landforms but have less than 10 inches of a silt mantle over the eolian sands.  Kindanina soils are in depressional areas and contain permafrost."
