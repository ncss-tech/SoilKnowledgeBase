These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from fine grained sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."
