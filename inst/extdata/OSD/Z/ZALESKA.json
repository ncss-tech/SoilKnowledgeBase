  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zaleska series consists of shallow to hard bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from shale, siltstone and fine grained sandstone.  Zaleska soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 25 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
