  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zylstra soils are on hills and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils are formed in compacted glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations range from 40 to 90 meters.  These soils occur in a mild marine climate with warm dry summers and mild wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 635 to 1016 mm, most of which falls as rain in the late fall, winter and early spring.  The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.  The frost-free period is about 200-240 days."

Coveland soils are fine-loamy and do not have a densic contact above 100 cm.  Mitchellbay soils are on similar landscape positions as Zylstra soils.  Mitchellbay soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high in the A, E, and Bg horizons, and very low in the Cd horizon.  Zylstra soils have a perched water table as high as 23 cm from December through February and from 46 to 81 cm during October and March. At lower slope ranges, Zylstra soils are subject to occasional ponding for very brief durations from December to March."

(upper boundary of Cd horizon)\nParticle size control section - 25 to 94 cm (to the Cd horizon)\nDepth to redoximorphic features - 30 cm\nMost of the area mapped as Zylstra was previously mapped as Swantown in the 1950 Island County soil survey.  Swantown soils are loamy-skeletal and have a Bsm, or cemented horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
