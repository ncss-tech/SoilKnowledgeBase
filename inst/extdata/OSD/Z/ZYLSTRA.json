  "OVERVIEW": "The Zylstra series consists of moderately deep to densic contact, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in compacted glacial drift underlain by dense glaciomarine deposits.  Zylstra soils are on hillslopes and outwash plains at elevations from 40 to 90 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm.  The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

These soils occur in a mild marine climate with warm dry summers and mild wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 635 to 1016 mm, most of which falls as rain in the late fall, winter and early spring.  The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.
