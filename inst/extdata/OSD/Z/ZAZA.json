  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zaza soils are on south-facing canyon and mountain slopes and hills on plateaus and have slopes of 4 to 65 percent. They formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt with loess mixed into the upper layers. Elevations are 4,000 to 5,350 feet. The average annual precipitation is 26 to 28 inches. The climate is humid with cold, snowy winters and moderately warm, dry summers. The average annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F., and the frost season is 60 to 110 days."

Brody and Culdesac soils have volcanic ash in the surface layers and are on north and east aspects. Cramont soils have fine textured argillic horizons, are very deep, and are on broad ridges. Klickson soils are deep and are on similar landscape positions. Wapshilla soils have argillic horizons, are very deep, and are on north and east aspects."
