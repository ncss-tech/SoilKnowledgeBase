  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zaza series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basalt with loess mixed into the upper layers. Zaza soils are on south-facing canyon and mountain slopes and hills on plateaus and have slopes of 4 to 65 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

The climate is humid with cold, snowy winters and moderately warm, dry summers. The average annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F., and the frost season is 60 to 110 days."
