    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development ranges from 61 to 114 cm (24 to 45 inches). The depth of horizons containing more than 15 percent sand ranges from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Depth to carbonates is typically 64 to 89 cm (25 to 35 inches) but ranges from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches).\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap, A, or E horizon) is silt loam. The Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Value of 5 is allowed in eroded pedons.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe second part of the series control section (Bt horizon) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Average clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe third part of the series control section (2Bt or 2BC horizon) has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe lower part of the series control section (2C horizon) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 2 to 8. It is loam, sandy loam, silt loam, silt, loamy sand, sand, or the fine or very fine analogs where appropriate. The sand fraction in individual strata or subhorizons is poorly sorted and well graded. Gravel content is less than 15 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Libre, Minnith, Rockfield, Somonauk and Morningsun soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 40 inches. Birkbeck, Campton, Homen, Inton, Iona, Redbud, Uniontown, and Winfield soils are greater than 40 inches to horizons containing more than 15 percent sand. Elco and Cadiz soils contain more than 25 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Eleroy, Rocheport, and Baraboo soils have a lithic or paralitihic contact within the series control section. Mayville soils are not stratified and have well graded and poorly sorted sand fraction in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Zurich soils typically are on convex slopes which are gently rolling to very steep in outwash plains of Wisconsin Age. Slopes commonly are between 1 and 18 percent, but range from 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or silty material and calcareous stratified outwash. Climate has cold winters and hot summers. Mean annual air temperatures range from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F.), annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 1140 mm (29 to 45 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180, and elevation ranges from 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1,000 feet)."

Aptakistic soils are the somewhat poorly drained member of the same drainage sequence and are on the more level areas in the landscape. Grays soils are mollic intergrades and are on similar landscape positions nearby. The Saylesville soils which contain more clay are on lakebed positions nearby."
