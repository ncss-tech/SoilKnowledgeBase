  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zoltay series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Zoltay soils are on alluvial fans, terraces, and valley sideslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
