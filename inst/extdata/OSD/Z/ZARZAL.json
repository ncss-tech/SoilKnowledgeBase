  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is more than 80 inches.  Rock fragment range 0 to 15 percent in the solum.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid in the A horizon and very strongly acid to strongly acid in the Bo, Bw, and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or clay.\nThe Bo horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of red range from none to common, generally increasing with depth.  Texture is clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma or 6 or 8.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of red and yellow range from none to common, and below a depth of 50 inches, iron depletions in shades of gray range from none to common.  Texture is clay.  Because of poor dispersion, measured clay ranges from 25 to 45 percent.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma or 6 or 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, yellow, and gray range from none to common.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered sandstone material. Igneous pebbles range from 10 to 50 percent, by volume."

Humatas soils have mixed mineralogy and argillic horizons.  Los Guineas soils have mixed mineralogy and lack a kandic horizon.  Yunque soils have less clay in the control section and mixed mineralogy."
