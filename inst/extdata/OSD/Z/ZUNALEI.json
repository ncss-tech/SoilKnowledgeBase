  "REVDATE": "10/2007",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Zunalei series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in eolian material, alluvium and fan alluvium derived from sandstone. Zunalei soils are on fan remnants on valley sides and dipslopes of cuestas. Slopes range from 2 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
