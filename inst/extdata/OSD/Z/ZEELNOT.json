Fritz soils have 12 to 22 percent clay in the control section and average summer soil temperatures of 52 to 58 degrees F.  Gepton soils have 11 to 18 percent clay in the control section and have cambic horizons. Hanson soils have mollic epipedons greater than 12 inches thick. Hardol soils have 8 to 18 percent clay and moderately rapid permeabiltiy.  Pahreah soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Skaggs soils are moderately deep to bedrock and receive more precipitation than Zeelnot soils.  Skibo soils have an O horizon and 18 to 25 percent clay in the control section.  Zeale soils have moderate permeability and the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 50 to 80 percent."

Elevation is 7,000 to 9,000 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and cool and dry in summer.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches; average annual temperature is 35 to 39 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 40 days."
