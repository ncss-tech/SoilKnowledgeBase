  "OVERVIEW": "The Zeelnot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from limestone.  Zeelnot soils are on foothills and mountains.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
