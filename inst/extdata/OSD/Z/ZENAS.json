  "OVERVIEW": "The Zenas series consists of deep, well drained soils on hills and sinkholes. They formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying residuum from limestone.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
