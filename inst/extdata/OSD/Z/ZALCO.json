  "OVERVIEW": "The Zalco series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium of Holocene age. These nearly level soils are on natural levees of streams. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
