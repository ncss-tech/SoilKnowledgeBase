  "OVERVIEW": "The Zephyrcove series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from trachyte. The Zephyrcove soils are on sideslopes and ridgetops on mountains. Slopes range from 9 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 700 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
