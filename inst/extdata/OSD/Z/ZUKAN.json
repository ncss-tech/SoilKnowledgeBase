The taxonomic placement is based on the assumption that the thickness requirement for a calcic horizon is not met.\nThis soil was previously classified as a Lithic Torriorthents.\nUpdates and revisions for the correlation of Navajo Mountain Area (AZ711), July 2, 2008, CEM\nUpdate and revisions for the correlation of Chinle Area (AZ713), August 2011, LJGII\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
