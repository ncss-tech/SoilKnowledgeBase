  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches becomes moist in some part of November or early December and remains moist until May, and is dry all the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 degrees to 57 F.  Organic matter content is 1 to 4 percent to depth at least 20 inches and decreases regularly with increasing depth.  Pebbles make up about 0 to 15 percent and cobbles about 0 to 10 percent of the profile, by volume.  These fragments tend to be more numerous in the lower part of the profile.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  From August to October the soil has cracks 1 to 4 cm wide at the surface and 1 cm wide at a depth of 50 cm.  Some pedons have slickensides in the lower part of the A horizon, but not close enough to intersect.  Clay minerals are dominantly montmorillonitic, and average more than 60 percent of the fine earth fraction in the 10- to 40-inch control section.\nThe A1 horizon is gray, dark gray, grayish brown or dark grayish brown (10YR 5/1, 4/1, 5/2, 4/2).\nThe AC horizon is finely mixed gray, dark gray, grayish brown or dark grayish brown (10YR 5/1, 4/1, 5/2, 4/2) and light brownish gray, pale brown or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4).\nThe C1 horizon is light brownish gray, pale brown or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4).  It is clay or silty clay."

Ayar and Diablo soils average less than 60 percent clay, slickensides close enough to intersect, and have cracks 1 cm wide and that are open in most years to a depth of 50 cm.  Gazos and Linne soils have less than 35 percent clay in the textural control section.  Santa Lucia soils have more than 35 percent, by volume, rock fragments 2 mm or larger in the textural control section.  Zaca soils average less than 60 percent clay and have a mean annual soil temperature of about 60 degrees F."

The parent material is highly weathered.  Elevations are 1,000 to 2,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cool wet winters and warm dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 25 inches.  Average January temperature is 44 degrees to 46 degrees F.; average July temperature is 60 degrees to 63 degrees F.; the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees to 57 degrees F.
