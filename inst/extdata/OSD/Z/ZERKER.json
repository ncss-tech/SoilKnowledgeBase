    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years, the soils are dry between depths of 6 to 18 inches from May 1 until October 15.  The remainder of the year the soil is intermittently moist.  Between October 15 and May 1 the soil is usually moist 45 consecutive days, but is not moist for as long as 90 consecutive days.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 63 degrees F.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent and decreases regularly with depth.  Lime content is 1 to 10 percent in the upper 40 inches and 5 to 20 percent in the lower 40 inches.  Angular coarse sands are 30 percent or more.  Stratification is present in the lower part of\nthe profile.  About 5 to 15 percent subrounded granitic gravel 2 to 5mm in size occur throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/3.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy loam or loam.  It is slightly to violently effervescent.  Lime is disseminated or segregated. Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.  Clay content is 15 to 28 percent.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 7/3; 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6.
