  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 4 to 19 inches and\ncorresponds to the depth to the petrocalcic horizon.  Depth to\nlimestone bedrock is 5 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments of\nlimestone and caliche comprise 35 to 80 percent by volume of the\nsoil mass.  About 5 to 50 percent are gravel size, 10 to 35\npercent cobble size, and 1 to 60 percent stone size.  More than 40\npercent of the soil mass less than 20 mm is made up of limestone\nfragments and reprecipitated carbonates.\nThe A horizon is brown (7.5YR 5/2, 4/2; 10YR 5/3, 4/3), dark\ngrayish brown (10YR 4/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), very\ndark gray (10YR 3/1), or dark brown (7.5YR 3/2).  Moist values and\nchromas are 2 or 3.  The fine earth fraction is loam, silt loam,\nor clay loam with a clay content of 18 to 32 percent.  Structure\nis weak to moderate, granular to subangular blocky, in fine to\nmedium sizes.  Moist consistence is very friable to friable.\ncalcium carbonate equivalent is 10 to 30 percent in the fine earth\nfraction.\nThe Ccam horizon is strongly cemented to indurated and laminar in\nthe upper part with cementation decreasing with depth.\nThe R & Ca layer is lacking in some pedons.  The R layer in most\npedons consists of thick beds of indurated limestone, but some\npedons are over interbedded limestone containing thin strata of\nchalk and marl.\nCompeting Series:  These include the Amistad, Boracho, Ector,\nJimenez, Kavett, Olmos, Talpa and Tarrant series.  Amistad,\nBoracho, Ector, Kavett, Talpa and Tarrant soils have mean annual\nsoil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  In addition, Amistad\nsoils are over flaggy limestone.  Boracho soils have mixed\nmineralogy.  Ector, Talpa, and Tarrant soils lack petrocalcic\nhorizons.  Jimenez and Olmos series lack the indurated limestone\nlayer immediately below the petrocalcic horizon; and in addition,\nJimenez soils have mixed mineralogy and contain many siliceous\npebbles in the soil mass."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zorra soils are on gently undulating to hilly\nuplands.  Slopes range from less than 1 to 15 percent.  Rock\noutcrops are common, especially where gradients are over 8\npercent.  Stones generally occupy 1 to 15 percent of the surface.\nThe underlying rock is indurated limestone of the Cretaceous\nsystem, mainly of the Buda and Georgetown formations.  Some areas\nare interbedded with thin strata of marl or chalk.  The  mean\nannual temperature is 70 degrees to 75 degrees F.  Average annual\nprecipitation ranges from 15 to 23 inches and the Thornthwaite P-E\nindex ranges from 19 to 31."

Dev and Elindio\nsoils are over 20 inches deep and occur at lower elevation in\nalluvial sediments.  Lozier soils occur in similar positions and\nlack mollic epipedons and petrocalcic horizons.  Valverde soils\noccur in similar positions and are over 20 inches deep, and lack\nmollic epiedons.  Felipe soils are formed over shaly clay and\noccur on the steeper slopes and breaks at lower or higher\nelevations.\nDrainage and Permeability:  Well drained; medium to rapid runoff;\nmoderate perameability."
