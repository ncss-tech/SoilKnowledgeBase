  "OVERVIEW": "The Zimwala series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments overlain by alluvium derived from mixed rocks with an admixture of eolian material.  The Zimwala soils are on lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
