  "OVERVIEW": "The Zeegee series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Zeegee soils are on stream terraces.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
