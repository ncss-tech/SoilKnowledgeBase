    "content": "TYPE LOCATION: Rich County, Utah- about 4 miles south and 2 miles west of Neponset Lake, 2,800 feet north and 100 feet east of the SW corner of section 20, T. 7 N., R. 7 E.\nRange in Characteristics: The depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Gravel ranges from O to 10 percent. The mean annual soil temperature is 40x to 42x F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 60x to 62x F. The soil is dry in all parts more than half and less than three fourths of the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is warmer than 41x F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and siightly calcareous or moderately calcareous.\nThe C horizon has dominant hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5Y, less commonly 2.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 8 moist and dry. It is silty clay loam or silty clay. This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nCompeting Series: These are the Lothair and Zagg series. These soils have deep cracks more than 1 cm wide.\nGeographic Setting: Zegro soils are mainly on foothills. The slopes range from 2 to 15 percent and are slightly convex-concave. The soils formed in residuum and alluvium derived dominantly from interbedded shales and some siltstone. Elevations range from 6,050 feet to 7,000 feet. The mean annual temperature ranges from 38x to 40x F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 13 inches. Freeze-free period is 60 to 75 days.\nGeographically Associated Soils: These are the Neponset, Alhark, Lariat, Woodpass, and the competing Zagg soils. Neponset SoilS have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Alhark, Lariat, and Woodpass soils have a layer of carbonate accumulation. Zagg soils are very deep and have cracks more than 1 cm. wide and are on slightly concave landscape positions.\nDrainage and Permeability: Well drained; medium and rapid runoff; slow permeability.\nUse and Vegetation: These soils are used for rangeland. Principal vegetation is Nuttall saltbush, winterfat, western wheatgrass and Indian ricegrass.\nDistribution and Extent: The soils of this series are of small extent in northeastern Utah."
