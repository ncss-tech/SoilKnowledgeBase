  "OVERVIEW": "The Zola series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in recent alluvium from volcaniclastic materials.  They are on stream terraces and floodplains.  Permeability is slow or moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
