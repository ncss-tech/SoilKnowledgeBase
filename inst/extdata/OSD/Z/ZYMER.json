    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Zymer soils are on backslopes and ridgetops of mountains at elevations of 800 to 1,800 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 90 percent.  They formed in colluvium from volcanic ash and basic igneous rock, including porphoritic andesite and olivine basalt, with a mantle of aerially deposited volcanic ash.  The climate is marine with cool, wet winters and warm, moist summers.  Average annual precipitation is 90 to 120 inches.  Average January temperature is about 38 degrees F.; average July temperature is 64 degrees F.; average annual temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."
