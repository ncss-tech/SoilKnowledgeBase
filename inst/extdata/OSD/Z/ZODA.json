  "OVERVIEW": "The Zoda series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff. The Zoda soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
