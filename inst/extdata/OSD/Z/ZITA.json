  "OVERVIEW": "The Zita series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in calcareous, loamy eolian deposits from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. Zita soils are on nearly level and very gently sloping plains with slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F)",
