These soils formed in slope alluvium from rhyolite, rhyodacite, andesite, and granite.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 59 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches occurring mainly as thunderstorms in July and August and rain or snow in December and January.  The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 180 days."
