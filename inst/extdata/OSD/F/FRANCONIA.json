  "OVERVIEW": "The Franconia series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Franconia soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 1 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
