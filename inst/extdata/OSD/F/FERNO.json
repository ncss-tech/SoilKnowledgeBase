  "OVERVIEW": "The Ferno series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and/or residuum derived from basalt. Ferno soils are on footslopes of hills and relict faults. Slopes range from 2 to 23 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
