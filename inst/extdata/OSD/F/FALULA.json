  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock typically is about 17 inches but ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  The thickness of the solum and the depth to carbonate accumulation commonly are about 7 to 12 inches thick.  The thickness of the solum and the depth to carbonate accumulation commonly are about 10 inches but range from 7 to 12 inches.  Rock fragments in the particle size control section commonly are angular gravel but range to cobbles and stones.  They range from 45 to 85 percent and increase in amount with increasing depth.  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 or more consecutive days within the 4 months following summer solstice.\nThe A horizons have hues of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It commonly is gravelly loam or very gravelly loam and less commonly, extremely gravelly silt loam, extremely cobbly silt loam, gravelly silt loam or loam.  The lower part includes extremely gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, and extremely cobbly loam.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 85 percent, with 10 to 50 percent as gravel and 0 to 45 percent as cobbles and stones.  The A horizons are neutral to moderately alkaline and noncalcareous to slightly calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8 dry and 3 through 6 moist.  It commonly is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loam and less commonly very gravelly silt loam, extremely gravelly silt loam, very cobbly loam, extremely cobbly silt loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 50 to 85 percent with 30 to 60 percent as gravel and 0 to 50 percent as cobbles and stones.  The Bk horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Agassiz, Alomax, Anatone, Bluecanyon, Cedaran, Dipcreek, Foxol, Gomine, Hogsby, Kenypeak, Little Pole, Onaqui, Rexmont, and Van Wagoner soils do not have a horizon of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Bocker and Starglade soils have lithic contact at depths of 4 to 10 inches.  Gando and Swanner soils have hue of 10YR throughout the profile.  Grink soils have a mollic epipedon 14 to 20 inches thick.  Nayrib soils have lithic contact at depths of 6 to 10 inches."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived mainly from sandstone and conglomerate.  Elevations range from 5,950 to 8,000 feet.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches.  The frost free season is 60 to 100 days."

Kearl soils are moderately deep, have a cambic horizon, and are on foothills.  Thatcher soils are very deep and have an argillic horizon.  Solak, Ellett, and Gridge soils lack a mollic epipedon.  Vanni soils are very deep, carbonatic, and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section."
