  "OVERVIEW": "The Fattig soils consist of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from shale or sandstone.  These soils are moderately permeable and on uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature about 45 degrees F.",
