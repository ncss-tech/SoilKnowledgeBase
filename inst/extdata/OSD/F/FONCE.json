Alcova, Almy, Bateson, Fluetsch, Forelle, Harsha, Rawah, Rock River, and Satanka soils lack a calcic horizon.  Stunner has less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle-size control section and C horizons, and lacks skeletal horizons below the argillic horizon.   Hickey soils have mean annual soil temperatures that range from 38 to 43 degrees F.  Maysprings and Taffom soils lack calcium carbonates 40 inches.  Alogia soils are moderately well drained with gypsum accumulation below 22 inches.  Anchutz soils need further study.  Stylite soils have a gypsic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fonce soils are on plateaus and fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and in aeolian deposits over relict stream deposits.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 13 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 75 to 95 days.  July is the driest month during the growing season."
