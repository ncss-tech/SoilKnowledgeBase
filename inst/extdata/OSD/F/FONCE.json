  "OVERVIEW": "The Fonce series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in aeolian deposits, alluvium, and colluvium derived from sandstone.  Fonce soils are on foot slopes, plateaus, and fan terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Alcova, Almy, Bateson, Fluetsch, Forelle, Harsha, Rawah, Rock River, and Satanka soils lack a calcic horizon.  Stunner has less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle-size control section and C horizons, and lacks skeletal horizons below the argillic horizon.   Hickey soils have mean annual soil temperatures that range from 38 to 43 degrees F.  Maysprings and Taffom soils lack calcium carbonates 40 inches.  Alogia soils are moderately well drained with gypsum accumulation below 22 inches.  Anchutz soils need further study.  Stylite soils have a gypsic horizon."
