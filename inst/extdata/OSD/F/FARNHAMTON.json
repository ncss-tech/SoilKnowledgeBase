    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Farnhamton soils are on gently sloping natural levees adjacent to the Kootenai River and major tributary streams crossing the flood plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium.  Elevations range from 1,700 to 2,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid with cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches.  The average frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bane, DeVoignes, Pywell, Ritz, and Schoorson soils.  Bane soils are on alluvial fans and in a sandy family.  DeVoignes and Schnoorson soils are on concave areas of flood plains and are fine-silty.  Pywell soils are on concave areas of flood plains and are very deep organic soils.  Ritz soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces and are poorly drained."

Natural vegetation is mainly western redcedar, grand fir, Douglas-fir, and black cottonwood, with willow, thinleaf alder, redosier dogwood, common ladyfern, pyramid spirea, sedge, tufted hairgrass, and wild iris."
