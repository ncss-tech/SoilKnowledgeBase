  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fabens series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Permeability is slow in the solum and moderate in the substratum.  These level soils are on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
