  "REVDATE": "10/98",
  "STATES": "ND,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Felor series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy sediments overlying clayey sediments.  These soils have moderate permeability in the upper solum and slow permeability in the lower solum and underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Depth to clayey sediments typically is between 20 and 35 inches.  Pebbles are few or common in the upper solum and a pebble line typically is between the two sediments.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam averaging between 25 to 35 percent clay and 40 to 65 percent sand. It is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have a Bw or Bk horizon that have the color of the Bt horizon and are sandy clay loam or clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam averaging 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk and 2C horizons typically are multicolored and have hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are clay, silty clay or silty clay loam and are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Siltstone or sandstone is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

All of these soils except Dooley, Greenway, and Livona soils do not have a loamy mantle over clayey sediments.  In addition, Fairfield, Farnuf, Martinsdale, and Vida have carbonates at depths above 20 inches.  Lefor, Lininger, Moen, Reeder, and Watrous soils have bedrock at depths between 20 and 40 inches. Trag soils do not have free carbonate, and Wemple soils are high in volcanic ash.  Dooley, Greenway, and Livona soils all contain more sand and gravel within depths of 40 inches below the surface, having formed in loamy sediments over glacial till.  In addition, Dooley and Livona contain less clay in the lower part of the soil."

The soils formed in loamy sediment overlying clayey sediments of mixed origin.  Climate is cool and semi-arid.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  Most precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

Belfield and Daglum soils are in swales and nearly level uplands that have microrelief and they have natric horizons.  Morton soils have bedrock between a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are on similar landscapes.  Ridgeview soils are on flats and are fine throughout the profile."
