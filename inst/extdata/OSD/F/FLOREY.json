  "OVERVIEW": "The Florey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from interbedded sedimentary rocks. These soils are on fan remnants and ridges. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 550 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 0.8 degrees C.",
