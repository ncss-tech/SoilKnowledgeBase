The concept of the Firoke series recognizes amorphic mineralogy and a volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent. The Firoke series is correlated to the ponderosa pine-Oregon white oak plant association. The concept of the Tumac series recognizes mixed mineralogy and a volcanic glass content of 5 to 30 percent. The Tumac series is correlated to the grand fir-Douglas-fir plant association.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--National Soil Survey Laboratory pedon number 87P0059\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
