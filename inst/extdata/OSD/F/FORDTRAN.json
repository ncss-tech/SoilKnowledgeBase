  "OVERVIEW": "The Fordtran series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are stream terraces on coastal plains.  Slopes are generally less than 2 percent, but range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 in), and mean annual air temperature is about degrees 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
