The soils are formed in material weathered from valley fill sediments from mixed rock sources of the Fair Oaks or Laguna Formations.  The sediments are weakly to moderately consolidated sandstone and siltstone.  In some areas the sediments have thin discontinuous strata of tuff.  The climate is subhumid with hot, dry summmers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches.  Mean January temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F; mean July temperature 76 to 79 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 230 to 300 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was previously mapped as the Whitney soil in Sacramento County.  The type location has been moved to this site in Sacramento County because it more closely represents the series concept of a fine-loamy soil with an abrupt boundary and with very slow permeability.  In some pedons, the A horizon is very strongly acid or strongly acid because of the addition of fertilizers.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in March of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon:  the zone from the surface to 15 inches (A1, A2, A3 horizons)\nArgillic horizon:  the zone from 15 to 28 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizon)\nDuripan - the zone from 28 to 40 inches (Bqm, Bq horizons) continously indurated at upper boundary.\nParalithic contact - at 40 inches (Cr1, Cr2 horizons) fragments breakdown after shaking in water.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lincoln Laboratory Sample No. S79CA067-4 (this pedon).  Additional sites sampled as S82CA067-8 in Sacramento County by Lincoln Laboratory and S69 Calif. 31-13 in Placer County by Riverside Laboratory.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
