  "OVERVIEW": "The Freestone series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium derived from shale and siltstone of Eocene Age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on stream terraces on inland dissected coastal plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F).",
