  "OVERVIEW": "The Fancher series consists of moderately deep, well drained, fine textured, (maximal) Reddish Prairie soils developed in hydrothermally altered serpentine rock.  They occur on steep to very steep ridges under annual grass and forbs or woodland-grass-shrub vegetation.  The Fancher soils have reddish brown loam to clay loam, often gravelly or cobbly A horizons and reddish brown, neutral to slightly acid, gravelly clay or clay B2t horizons overlying highly fractured serpentine bedrock.  The soils have relatively high calcium-magnesium ratios (1:1 to 2:1) compared to other soils developed on serpentine.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The A horizons range in texture from loam to clay loam and are often gravelly or cobbly.  Some areas may be stony or rocky.  The surface soils range in color from reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4) and (5YR 4/4) dry, too dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4 and 5YR 3/3, 3/4) moist; and in reaction from slightly acid to neutral.  They are commonly massive and slightly hard or hard, but on protected areas may have 2 to 4 inch granular surface horizons.  The B2t horizons are usually redder than the surface soils, being dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4) when dry and dark reddish brown to dark red (2.5YR 3/4 or 3/6) when moist.  Subsoils range in texture from clay to gravelly clay; in reaction from neutral to slightly acid, occasionally mildly alkaline; and the structure is strong angular blocky.  The B3t horizons may be brown (7.5YR 5/4) to light reddish brown (2.5YR or 5YR 6/4).  They range in texture from loam to clay loam and are gravelly to very gravelly.  The C horizons are structureless, gravelly loamy horizons of varied greenish and yellowish colors inherited from the parent material.  The thickness of the solum may range from 18 to 48 inches."

Dubakella soils have high C/N ratios and are clay loams throughout.  Guenoc soils have dark red, medium acid B2t horizons abruptly overlie hard serpentine bedrock at depths less than 20 inches.  Sacata soils have red, clay B2t horizons developed in mica schist.  The Trabuco soils are very similar but are developed on basic igneous rock (gabbro)."

The mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 180 to 220 days."

Principally annual grasses and forbs with some perennial grasses of the stipa species.  On protected and north-facing slopes a grass-shrub (mainly wedgeleaf ceanothus) or woodland (blue oak) grass shrub cover is found."

This name was used for a young Alluvial soil in the 1900 soil survey around Fresno.  The name was discarded and the soils correlated with other series in the 1912 Soil Survey of the Eastern Fresno Area.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in January of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. Minerology was left as mixed due to lack of lab data and high calcium-magnesium ratios. - ET\nOSED scanned by SSQA. Last revised by state on 10/63."
