  "OVERVIEW": "The Forvic series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep to a duripan, that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from welded tuff.  They are on terraces, summits, and hillsides.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
