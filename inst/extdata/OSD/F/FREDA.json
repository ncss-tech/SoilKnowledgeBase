The volume of shale channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A, E, and Bh horizons and from 10 to 35 percent in the Bs horizon.  The profile ranges from extremely acid to medium acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A, E, and Bhs horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam or the channery analogues of these textures.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is derived from shale or siltstone.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Textures are sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the channery analogues of these textures."
