  "OVERVIEW": "The Freda series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in loamy glacial till over siltstone or shale bedrock on ground moraines and lakeshore benches.  Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The volume of shale channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A, E, and Bh horizons and from 10 to 35 percent in the Bs horizon.  The profile ranges from extremely acid to medium acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A, E, and Bhs horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam or the channery analogues of these textures.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is derived from shale or siltstone.\nSome pedons have a C horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Textures are sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the channery analogues of these textures."
