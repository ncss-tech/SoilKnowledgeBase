  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 59 to 66 degrees F.  They are not saturated with water throughout for some period but are saturated within 40 inches of the surface for some period unless artificially drained.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are within 40 inches of the surface but are commonly below 20 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is dominantly moderately coarse textured and has a weighted average of less than 18 percent clay, more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand, and less than 15 percent rock fragments.  The organic matter content decreases regularly with depth and reaches a level of 0.5 percent or less within 50 inches of the surface.  The mollic epipedon (and solum) is 7 to 16 inches thick.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 5.5 dry and 2 to 3.5 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or 2.  It has weak or moderate granular structure or has weak platy structure in the upper few inches.  This horizon ranges from slightly to moderately calcareous and from mildly to strongly alkaline.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5.5 through 7 dry and 3.5 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is dominantly moderately coarse textured, but medium textured layers may be below a depth of 30 inches.  This horizon is moderately or strongly calcareous but does not qualify as a calcic horizon because of lack of decrease in carbonates.  Some pedons are saline or (and) alkali-affected."

Balm soils have a layer of loose sand and gravel above 40 inches.  Balm, Kodak, Martini, Parehat, Sunset, Vineyard, and Syracuse soils have mean annual soil temperatures warmer than 47 degrees F.  Blackfoot, Parehat, and Sunset soils have medium-textured control sections.  Blackfoot, Kodak, Martini, and Parehat soils have an organic matter content that does not decrease regularly with depth to a level of 0.5 percent or less within 50 inches of the surface.  Syracuse and Vineyard soils have calcic horizons.  Weeding soils have a loamy sand control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils are in level to very gently sloping terraces at elevations of 4,300 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes are dominantly less than 2 percent and range from 0 to 4 percent.  The soils formed mostly in moderately coarse textured alluvium, in most places over lake-laid sediments.  The alluvium is dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources but contains some rhyolite, basaltic, and granitic materials.  In places the upper part may be eolian sediments.  The climate is semiarid.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches, including 1.5 to 5 feet of snowfall.  Average freeze-free period is 94 to 126 days."

Wapello and Wolverine soils lack mottles.  Also, Wolverine soils are dominantly sand between depths of 10 and 40 inches."
