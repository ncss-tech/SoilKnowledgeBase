  "OVERVIEW": "The Frogwoman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from sandstone or graywacke.  Frogwoman soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

The soil is dry between a depth of 10 and 31 inches or lithic contact from June to October, in most years, and usually moist the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/4 or 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 3/3, 3/2; or 7.5YR 3/4.  Moist values greater than 3 occur in the lower A horizon below 4 inches.  Particle size is sandy loam or loam, and is gravelly or cobbly.  Clay content is 12 to 25 percent.  It is strongly acid to neutral and base saturation (sum of cations) ranges from 50 to 90 percent.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 35 percent.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 7/4, 7/2, 6/3, 6/4. 6/2 or 5/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/3, 3/4; or 7.5YR 4/4.
