    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to Bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to Fragipan is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to redox depletions or iron concentrations is greater than 16 inches.  Content of clay in the control section is 18 to 30 percent.  Rock fragments ranges from 0 to 2 percent in the surface, 0 to 5 percent in the upper solum above the fragipan, 5 to 30 percent in the fragipan.  Content of rock fragments in the control section is 1 to 10 percent.  Kind of rock fragments are sedimentary and metamorphic shale, siltstone and sandstone; gravel to channers.  In Unlimed areas, soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the solum, strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the solum and moderately acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 5 or 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe 2Btx horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.  Structure is strong or moderate, very coarse to medium prismatic parting to moderate medium platy.  Consistence is firm or very firm and brittle.\nThe 2BCx horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fountainville soils are at heads of drains and along broad drainageways in the Northern piedmont Province.  The soils are on summits and back slopes.  They are formed in a thin mantle of loess and in the underlying material weathered from metamorphic and sedimentary brown and red shale, siltstone and sandstone residuum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 to 45 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free days range from 155 to 190."

Alton, Klinesville, Pope and Steinsburg soils lack the argillic horizon.   Reaville soils have redox depletions of chroma 2 or less in the upper argillic horizon.  Klinesville soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock.   Chalfont and Doylestown soils have redox depletions of chroma 2 or less directly below the surface layer.  Bedington and Penn soils which do not have the thin loess mantle.  Lansdale soils contain more sand and coarse fragments.  Brownsburg soils have a loess mantle greater than 24 inches."
