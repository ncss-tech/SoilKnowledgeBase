  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the ash influenced eolian deposits ranges from 8 to 14 inches thick.  The solum ranges from 8 to 24 inches thick.  The exchange complex of the eolian mantle is dominated by amorphous material.  Textures in the control section include silt loam, fine sandy loam, and fine sand stratified with silt.  The weighted average particle size class of these materials is coarse-loamy.  There are less than 15 percent coarse fragments throughout the control section.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.  The E horizon has hue ranging from 5YR to 10YR; value from 3 through 7 moist; and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.\nThe Bs horizons have hue ranging from 5YR to 10YR; value from 3 through 5 moist; and chroma from 3 through 6 moist.\nThe Eb horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe 2Bsb horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; value moist of 4 or 5; and chroma moist of 3 or 4."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Flat Horn series occur on stream terraces. They formed in an admixture of eolian silt and volcanic ash overlying medium textured alluvium.  The climate is transitional between maritime and continental with the average annual precipitation ranging from 13 to 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 33 to 36 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent."
