  "OVERVIEW": "The Flumeville series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Flumeville soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees.",

The epipedon ranges from 0.6 to 4 percent organic carbon decreasing regularly with depth.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depth of 5 and 16 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1.  It is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2; 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 2/2 or 3/2.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 50 to 70 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is 5Y 7/1, 7/2, 8/2; 2.5Y 7/2; 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 6/2, 7/1 or 7/2.  Moist colors are 5Y 7/2, 7/3; 2.5Y 6/2; 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 4/2 or 5/2.

Redox concentrations occur between 10 and 30 inches and continue to greater than 60 inches.  The Bt horizon is a clay loam, or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent.  Hard gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 70 to 100 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid through neutral."

Biaggi, Bruhel, Cabrillo, Crispin, Mallopass and Windyhollow soils are also on marine terraces, often in slightly higher positions.  Biaggi soils lack mottling, are moderately deep to a lithic contact,and lack an argillic horizon.  Crispin soils lack mottling and are moderately deep to a cemented pan.  Mallopass soils are fine loamy and have mottles between 50 and 60 inches.  Cabrillo soils have mottles between 30 and 50 inches.  Windyhollow soils are fine-loamy and have mottles between 30 and 50 inches.  Stornetta soils are on floodplains, are fine-loamy and lack an argillic horizon."
