    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches.  The epipedon ranges from 0.6 to 4 percent organic carbon decreasing regularly with depth.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depth of 5 and 16 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1.  It is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2; 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 5/1 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/1, 2/2 or 3/2.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 50 to 70 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is 5Y 7/1, 7/2, 8/2; 2.5Y 7/2; 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 6/2, 7/1 or 7/2.  Moist colors are 5Y 7/2, 7/3; 2.5Y 6/2; 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 4/2 or 5/2.   Redox concentration colors are 10YR 5/6; 7.5YR 5/6,5/8; or 5YR 4/4.  Moist redox concentration colors are 10YR 5/6; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8 or 5YR 2.5/2.  Redox concentrations occur between 10 and 30 inches and continue to greater than 60 inches.  The Bt horizon is a clay loam, or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent.  Hard gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 70 to 100 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid through neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Flumeville soils occur on marine terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 10 to 1200 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F., mean July temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 330 days."

Biaggi, Bruhel, Cabrillo, Crispin, Mallopass and Windyhollow soils are also on marine terraces, often in slightly higher positions.  Biaggi soils lack mottling, are moderately deep to a lithic contact,and lack an argillic horizon.  Crispin soils lack mottling and are moderately deep to a cemented pan.  Mallopass soils are fine loamy and have mottles between 50 and 60 inches.  Cabrillo soils have mottles between 30 and 50 inches.  Windyhollow soils are fine-loamy and have mottles between 30 and 50 inches.  Stornetta soils are on floodplains, are fine-loamy and lack an argillic horizon."
