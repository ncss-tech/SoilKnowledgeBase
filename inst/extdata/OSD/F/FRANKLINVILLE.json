  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent in the upper part of the mineral solum and 15 to 35 percent in the lower part of the solum, and from 20 to 60 percent in the substratum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have a thin organic surface layer.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has hue, value and chroma similar to the B horizon. Fine earth texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam. Structure is weak fine or medium subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Fine earth texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have a 2Cr horizon above the bedrock that is deeper than 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Wawina series is the only one in the same family. Wawina soils have very fine sand and loamy fine sand textures throughout the solum.\nThe Bice, Dummerston, Elka, Haights, Lanesboro, Lode, Millsite, Mongaup, Schroon, Toimi, and Trow soils are similar soils in related families. The Bice soils have rock fragments derived dominantly from gneiss and granite. Dummerston soils have rock fragments mainly from phyllite, slate and schist. Elka soils are dominated by 5YR or redder hue in the subsoil and substratum. Millsite, Mongaup and Trow soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Haights soils are underlain by poorly sorted, weakly stratified deposits in the series control section. Lanesboro soils have rock fragments dominated by dark gray phyllite, slate or schist and have a Cd horizon. Lode soils contain sand and coarse sand within 40 inches of the soil surface. Schroon soils have redoximorphic features in the B horizon. Tiomi soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the subsoil and a Cd horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Franklinville soils are gently sloping to very steep soils on upland till plains, hilltops, ridges and valley sides. Slope ranges from 3 to 50 percent. The soils formed in till derived mainly from siltstone, fine-grained sandstone and smaller amounts of shale. Mean annual air temperatures ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and the mean annual frost-free season ranges from 90 to 120 days. These soils are at elevations that range from 1750 feet to 2400 feet above sea level."

Almond and Greene are somewhat poorly drained and in addition Greene and Mongaup are moderately deep to bedrock. Bath and Chadakoin soils occur at lower elevations. Ischua and Salamanca soils are fine-loamy, and Ischua is also moderately deep to bedrock. Lewbath, Willdin, and Yorkshire soils are on nearby associates that have fragipans."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 3 inches (A horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 42 inches (Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons) with less than 60 percent base saturation.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
