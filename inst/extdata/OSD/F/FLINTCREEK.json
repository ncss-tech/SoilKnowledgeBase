  "OVERVIEW": "The Flintcreek series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on glacial outwash plains, stream terraces and floodplains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
