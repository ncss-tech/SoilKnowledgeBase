  "OVERVIEW": "The Fern series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy till on ground moraines, end moraines, and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
