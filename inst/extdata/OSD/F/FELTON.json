  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to paralithic contact is 40 to 80 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 56 degrees F.; the mean winter soil temperature is about 47 degrees F.; and the mean summer soil temperature is about 60 degrees F. Soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches usually is dry in all parts all the time from mid-May to mid-June until about late October or early November and usually is moist the rest of the year.\nOrganic matter is 3 to 8 percent in the uppermost 10 inches of the profile and decreases gradually to 1.5 to 0.5 percent 20 inches below the surface and in most pedons is less than 1 percent within 16 to 25 inches of the surface. Base saturation is 60 to 75 percent in some part of the upper 30 inches of the profile and in most pedons is less than 75 percent in all parts. Base saturation in the lower part of the profile, below a depth of 30 inches, is 40 to 80 percent but in many pedons it is similar to that in the upper 30 inches of the profile. The soil is slightly or strongly acid in the A and B horizons and slightly to very strongly acid in the C horizon.\nShale fragments or other rock fragments usually are less than 15 percent in the A and B horizons and average less than 35 percent in all pedons. In pedons with C horizons, rock fragments make up 15 to 65 percent.\nThe A horizon is brown or dark brown in 7.5YR hue, dark reddish gray and dark reddish brown in 5YR hue and dark grayish brown or brown in 10YR hue, and has moist chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam, loam, silt loam or light clay loam and has moderate or strong granular, subangular blocky or angular blocky structure. The upper boundary of the Bt horizon is gradual or diffuse or there is a transitional AB or B horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is brown or light brown in 7.5YR hue, light yellowish brown, light brown, brown, pale brown or yellowish brown in 10YR hue and reddish brown, light reddish brown or yellowish red in 5YR hue and has moist chroma of 4 or 6. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam and has 6 to 15 percent more clay (absolute) than the A horizon. This horizon has moderate or strong subangular blocky or angular blocky structure. In some pedons a loam, sandy loam or clay loam C horizon modified by shale fragments is between the B horizon and the shale."
