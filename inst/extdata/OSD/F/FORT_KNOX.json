  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the organic deposits ranges from 40 to 130 cm. The soil is strongly acid to moderately alkaline in its natural condition and ultra-acid to neutral once oxidized. Mineral content (with varying textures from silty clay to sand) ranges from 5 to 50 percent throughout the organic portion of the profile. The electrical conductivity ranges from 0.6 to 4.5 dS/m in a 1:5 soil to water mixture by volume. Salt content ranges from about 5,000 to 35,000 ppm. The soil commonly is moderately saline in the surface tier and moderately saline to strongly saline in the subsurface and bottom tiers. In some places the range includes slightly saline.\nThe surface tier is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is comprised of either hemic or fibric materials. Unrubbed fiber content is 35 to 100 percent; rubbed fiber content ranges from 20 to 85 percent.\nThe subsurface tier is neutral or has a hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is comprised of either hemic or sapric materials. Unrubbed fiber content is 20 to 70 percent; rubbed fiber content is less than 40 percent.\nThe bottom tier, where present, is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is comprised of dominantly sapric materials, but some pedons have hemic materials. Unrubbed fiber content is 10 to 50 percent; rubbed fiber content is less than 40 percent.\nThe A horizon, where present, is neutral or has a hue of 5YR to 5Y, value 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture ranges from silt loam to loamy sand or their mucky modifiers. Clay content (by weight) is generally less than 18 percent. Some pedons have gravel and cobble sized fragments within this horizon ranging up to 5% (by volume).\nThe C horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5Y to 10B, value of 2 to 6 and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture ranges from sand to silty clay loam. Some pedons have more than 35 percent clay (by weight) below 130 cm. Organic matter content ranges from less than 5 percent to 20 percent. Shell fragments and herbaceous fibers are common."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are currently no other series in the same family. Westbrook soils are in a related family but occur in areas with a mesic soil temperature regime. Bestpitch and Pawcatuck soils are similar mesic soils in related families. Bestpitch soils are underlain by clayey materials with over 35 percent (by weight) in the fine-earth fraction. Pawcatuck soils are underlain by sandy materials within a depth of 40 to 130 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fort Knox soils are level and occur in tidal marshes along the coast of Maine. They are subject to tidal flooding twice daily except in areas protected by dikes and tide gates. These soils developed in partially decomposed organic material from salt tolerate herbaceous plants over loamy sediments. Mean annual temperature is 5 to 9 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is 1600 to 2200 mm."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Damariscotta, Gouldsboro, Todds Point, Petit Manan, Phippsburg, and Pemaquid soils in nearby tidal marsh areas. Damariscotta soils are sandy mineral soils with a thin to absent organic cap less than 20 cm thick. Gouldsboro soils are fine-silty mineral soils with a thin to absent organic cap less than 20 cm thick. Todds Point soils have organic materials greater than 130 cm thick and seldom have any mineral soil within 165 cm. Petit Manan soils have organic materials 40 to 130 cm thick and are underlain by fine-silty mineral materials. Phippsburg soils have an organic cap 20 to 40 cm thick and are underlain by sandy mineral materials. Pemaquid soils have organic materials 40 cm to 130 cm thick and are underlain by sandy mineral materials."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in salt marsh and provide food and habitat for fish, shellfish and wildfowl. Small scattered areas are in saltgrass hay. The most common grasses are salt meadow grass, salt water grass and spike grass. Other vegetation includes blackgrass, sea lavender, saltwort, seaside goldenrod, aster, and purple gerardi. In areas where the 1:5 EC soil to water by volume is below 1.5 dS/m, vegetation consists principally of tall reeds and sedges."
