  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 36 to 48 inches.  Thickness of the loess or depth to the underlying residuum or till ranges from 7 to 15 inches.  Dense concentrations of rock fragments are at depths of 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to lithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The solum is slightly acid to very strongly acid in the upper part and is strongly acid to extremely acid in the lower part.  Volume of angular pebbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon, 5 to 15 percent in the E/B and B/E horizons, and 5 to 35 percent in the Bt horizon.  If present, the BC and C horizons have from 15 to 60 percent pebbles by volume.  Volume of cobblestones ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the A, E/B, B/E and upper part of the Bt horizon, 5 to 35 percent in the lower part of the Bt horizon, and 35 to 60 percent in the BC or C horizon, if present.  Stony phases are recognized in some places.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value and chroma of 2 or 3. The lower value is typical of A horizons that are 3 to 5 inches thick.  It is typically silt loam, but stony silt loam is recognized in some places.\nSome pedons have a Bs horizon with 10YR or 7.5YR hue, but are too thin or do not meet the chemical requirements for spodic.\nThe E horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nFenwood soils have E/B or B/E horizons, or both.  These horizons have tongues of E material wholly surrounding small, isolated remnants of the Bt horizon or tongues of E material that penetrate the horizon from above.  The tongues of E are like the E horizon in color and texture.  The Bt part of these horizons is like Bt1 horizon in color and texture.\nThe Bt1 horizon has 7.5YR or 10YR hue with value and chroma of 4 or 5.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or gravelly loam.  The Bt2 horizon has 7.5YR or 10YR hue and value and chroma of 4 or 5.  It is gravelly or cobbly clay loam, gravelly or cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, or gravelly or cobbly sandy clay loam.  Clay films are faint or distinct and range from many to continuous on faces of most peds in the Bt horizon and in the Bt part of the B/E horizon.  The control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay, and from 30 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser.\nSome pedons have BC or C horizons that have 7.5YR of 10YR hue, value and chroma of 4 through 6.  They are cobbly or very cobbly sandy loam, or cobbly or very cobbly loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hiles, Loyal, Nashwauk, Rozellville, Santiago, and Tilleda soils in the same family and the Eaupleine, Freeon, and Mosinee soils.  Hiles soils have the lower part of their sola formed in stratified residuum weathered from sandstone and shale and have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Loyal, Santiago, and Tilleda soils, which formed in glacial till, do not contain as many cobbles in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.  Nashwauk soils have thicker sola and have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon.  Rozellville soils have bedrock at a depth greater than 5 feet and contain fewer coarse fragments in the lower Bt horizons.  Eaupleine and Freeon soils are coarse-loamy.  Mosinee soils are loamy-skeletal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on uplands underlain by bedrock.  Slopes are simple and typically have gradients of 3 to 12 percent but the range is from 2 to 30 percent.  Fenwood soils formed in thin layers of loess and underlying loamy glacial till or loamy residuum weathered from igneous and metamorphic bedrock or an admixture.  The glacial stratigraphy where these soils occur has not been fully worked out. The till is derived mainly from the local residuum.  Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 42 to 47 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Eaupleine, Meadland, Milladore, Rietbrock, and Rozellville soils.  Eaupleine and Rozellville soils are well drained and moderately well drained associates in similar landscape positions, but cannot always be separated from one another by specific relief.  Meadland and Milladore soils are somewhat poorly drained and occupy lower lying positions in some nearby areas.  The somewhat poorly drained Rietbrock soils are on low lying positions that are adjacent to the Fenwood soils and form a drainage sequence with them."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Field observations indicate that these soils have some evidence of till overlying the residuum or are a mixture of till and residuum in the upper part of the profile.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon); albic horizon - zone from 8 to 18 inches (E, E/B horizons); argillic horizon - zone from 18 to 43 inches (B/E, Bt1, Bt2 horizons); other features - tonguing of albic material into the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to soil sample number S70WI-37-4 and National Soil Survey Laboratory numbers 70L899 for data on the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
