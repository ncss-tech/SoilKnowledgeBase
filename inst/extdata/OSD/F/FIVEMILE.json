  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The content of organic carbon ranges from .2 to .8 percent in the surface horizons and decreases irregularly with depth. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 10 percent. Visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation may occur but is not concentrated into a definite continuous horizon and may occur at any depth within the control section. The control section is typically silty clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 40 to 70 percent, and sand from 10 to 35 percent with less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. The content of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent but is commonly less than 1 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature from 60 degrees to 68 degrees F. The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1, 2 or 3. It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6) and is generally calcareous throughout although it may be leached for a few inches in some pedons. This horizon has fine granular or crumb structure. It is soft to slightly hard. The C horizon has fine granular or crumb structure. It is soft to slightly hard. The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1, 2 or 3. It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 9.0). It contains 4 to about 10 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. This horizon is stratified with individual strata varying in texture and content of organic carbon."

Slaw soils have an average annual soil temperature of 53 to 57 degrees F. Slawha soils have less than 4 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the C horizon. Tours soils have hue of 5YR or redder."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fivemile soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains and alluvial fans. Slopes gradients typically range from 0 to about 6 percent. The soils formed in thick, stratified but predominantly silty, calcareous alluvial sediments derived principally from sedimentary rock in Wyoming and from mixed rocks in Nevada. The average annual precipitation is 4 to 9 inches. The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees to 47 degrees F. The average summer temperature is about 66 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
