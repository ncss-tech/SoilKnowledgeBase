    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Infantry (NM), Neso (NM), Orrubo (AZ), Paisano (TX), Philder (NM), Sutherland (AZ), Tencee (NM), Wechech (NV), and Wodavar (NV) series. Infantry soils have Bk horizons with 35 to 60 percent cobbles and have significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan desert. Neso soils receive significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan desert and are in a 30 to 38 centimeters (12 to 15 inch) precipitation zone. Orrubo soils have Cr horizons below the hardpan at depths between 43 to 76 centimeters (17 and 30 inches). Paisano soils receive significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan desert and depth to hardpan is less than 36 centimeters (14 inches). Philder soils have aridic soil moisture regimes that border on ustic and have 18 to 25 percent clay. Sutherland soils have an ustic aridic soil moisture regime. Tencee soils receive significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts. Wechech soils are less than 36 centimeters (14 inches) to the hardpan, and receive additional summer moisture. Wodavar soils have rock fragments that are mostly calcium carbonate nodules and formed in lacustrine sediments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ferrogold soils are on partial ballenas and fan remnants. These soils formed in alluvium mainly from limestone and dolomite. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,050 to 1,525 meters (3,440 to 5,000 feet). The climate is warm and arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers typical of the Mojave desert. The mean annual precipitation is 127 to 230 millimeters (5 to 9 inches); mean annual air temperature is 13 to 18 degrees C (56 to 64 degrees F), and the frost-free period is 180 to 230 days."
