  "OVERVIEW": "The Folcroft series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in human-transported materials with more than 10 percent artifacts over fluviomarine deposits. They occur where land leveling, and other construction activities took place on filled marshlands and alluvial deposits. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 1200 mm.",
