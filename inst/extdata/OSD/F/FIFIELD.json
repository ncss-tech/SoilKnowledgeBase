They are being differentiated from the Vallecitos series by having a mollic epipedon and being loamy-skeletal.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Organic carbon determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.  Base saturation determined by KC1-triethanolamine extract (sum of cations).\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
