(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted)\nA1--0 to 3 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) sandy loam, very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) moist; strong fine granular structure; soft, very friable, nonplastic, nonsticky; 5 percent gravel; noncalcareous; mildly alkaline, pH 7.6 (PR); clear smooth boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Unless otherwise noted the entire range of properties permissible for the diagnostic horizons or the subgroup and family are permissible for the series.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 0 to 6 inches but should not be deeper than the upper boundary of the B2 horizon.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 7 to 17 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and there should be no subhorizon more than 4 inches thick above 10 inches that exceeds these limits.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The control section is usually a sandy loam but clay may range from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent and sand from 45 to 82 percent with more than 35 percent fine or coarse sand.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the major part of the control section.  Coarse fragments ranging from 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter predominate.  Mottling not due to segregated lime ranges from none to a few faint mottles but if the soil is mottled at all the chroma of the matrix material must exceed 2.\nColor of the A horizon may range in hue from 5Y to 7.5YR, in value from 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 6 moist, and in chroma from 1 to 4.  Reaction normally ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Hue of the C horizon ranges from 5Y to 7.5YR.  Reaction normally ranges from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth ranges from about 4 to 14 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Similar and related series include the Fola and Toby series.  The Fola series differs in having more than 35 percent coarse fragments and in lacking bedrock above 40 inches.  The Toby series differs in having no bedrock above 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Feltner series occurs on moderately to steeply sloping hills and ridges.  Slopes typically range about 2 percent to about 30 or more percent.  The soil is developing on thin calcareous, moderately coarse textured materials weathered from soft sandstone and loamstone.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F., mean summer air temperature is 59 degrees F., mean annual soil temperature is 44 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature is 60 degrees F."
