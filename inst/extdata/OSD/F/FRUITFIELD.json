  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 42 inches.  Carbonates are absent to depths of 5 feet or more.  Reaction in the solum ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid in the most acid part.  Texture of the soil is sand or coarse sand throughout.  The control section averages more than 70 percent medium sand and coarser particles and 35 percent or more coarse sand or very coarse sand.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to about 5 percent by volume.  The gravel typically is less than 1 cm in diameter.  The mollic epipedon typically is more than 24 inches thick but ranges in thickness from about 18 to more than 36 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR with value and chroma of 3 or 4.   The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bellechester, Finchford, Hawick, Hononegah, Lasa, Sparta, Trempe, and Zumbro series in the same family and the Burkhardt and Flagler series.  Bellechester soils have carbonates in the lower part of the solum.  Finchford soils have less coarse and very coarse sand and contain more gravel.  Hawick and Hononegah soils contain more coarse fragments and have free carbonates in the C horizon.  Lasa soils have texturally stratified B horizons and contain more fine and very fine sand.  Sparta soils have less than 20 percent coarse and very coarse sand, more than 30 percent fine sand or finer, and have thinner mollic epipedons and typically lack coarse fragments.  Trempe soils typically have redder hue in the control section, contain less coarse and very coarse sand, and have a thinner mollic epipedon.  Zumbro soils are shallower to carbonates.  Burkhardt soils have less sand in the upper part of the solum, have a cambic horizon, and have more gravel in the substratum.  Flagler soils are coarse-loamy and have more gravel in the substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in coarse-textured alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 47 to 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 32 to 35 inches."

They are on slightly lower lying positions on the flood plains.  Toolesboro, Coland, and Shaffton soils have more clay in the solum and are more poorly drained.  They are on lower lying positions on the flood plains."
