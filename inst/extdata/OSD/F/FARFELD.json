  "OVERVIEW": "The Farfeld series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very slow in the lower part.  These soils are on upland plains and plateaus on drainage divides.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
