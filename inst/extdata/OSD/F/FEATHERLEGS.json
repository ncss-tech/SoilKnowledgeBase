The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 67 to 72 degrees F.\nThe mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  Depth to calcareous materials ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the base of the Bt horizon is 13 to 25 inches.  Depth to skeletal material is 15 to 40 inches.  Gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 30 percent above the lithologic discontinuity, and from 40 to 75 percent below.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The texture includes fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam and loam.  Gravelly and cobbly modifiers of these textures are allowed.  The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam and loam.  Gravelly and cobbly modifiers of these textures are allowed.  Clay averages 20 to 35 percent.  Fine or coarser sand is greater than 15 percent.  The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value 4 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist and chroma 2 to 4.  The texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam and clay loam.  Gravelly and cobbly modifiers of these textures are allowed.  The soil is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.  The horizon qualifies as a calcic horizon.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue 2.5Y or 10YR, value 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist, and chroma 2 to 4.  The texture includes loamy sand, sandy loam and loam.  Very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly and extremely cobbly modifiers of these textures are allowed.
