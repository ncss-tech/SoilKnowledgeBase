  "OVERVIEW": "The Featherlegs series consists of very deep, well drained soils.  These soils formed in alluvial, eolian and residual materials derived from mixed sources.  Featherlegs soils are on hills, hill slopes, alluvial fans, plateaus and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 67 to 72 degrees F.\nThe mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  Depth to calcareous materials ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the base of the Bt horizon is 13 to 25 inches.  Depth to skeletal material is 15 to 40 inches.  Gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 30 percent above the lithologic discontinuity, and from 40 to 75 percent below.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The texture includes fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam and loam.  Gravelly and cobbly modifiers of these textures are allowed.  The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam and loam.  Gravelly and cobbly modifiers of these textures are allowed.  Clay averages 20 to 35 percent.  Fine or coarser sand is greater than 15 percent.  The soil is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value 4 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist and chroma 2 to 4.  The texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam and clay loam.  Gravelly and cobbly modifiers of these textures are allowed.  The soil is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent.  The horizon qualifies as a calcic horizon.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue 2.5Y or 10YR, value 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist, and chroma 2 to 4.
