  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was originally classified as an Albaquic Hapludalf. In the current edition of Soil Taxonomy, Fragiaquic keys out ahead of Albaquic.   This update of the series changes the classification from Albaquic to Fragiaquic.\nThe sequence and nomenclature of the materials may differ depending on whether the upper part of the dense material is considered to be a part of the residuum or part of the loess. Three or as many as four lithologic discontinuities could be designated. The clay bulge is so abrupt that despite the claypan properties, the weighted clay percentage borders fine-silty. In many pedons the upper Bt horizon has clay films of darker material that make the horizon appear mollic unless kneaded color is used.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 6 inches to 64 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Btx1, 2Btx2, 2Btx3, and 3Bt horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Sampled as University of Missouri soil characterization laboratory reference number M8615909.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
