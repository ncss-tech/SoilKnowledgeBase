    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the 2Ex or 2Btx horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Chert gravel content by volume is 0 to 10 percent in the A and Bt horizons, 5 to 60 percent in the 2Btx horizon (2Ex if present); and 5 to 20 percent in the 3Bt horizon. Chert cobbles by volume are less than 5 percent in the A and Bt horizons, ranges to 40 percent in the 2Btx horizon (and 2Ex if present), and is less than 10 percent in the 3Bt horizon. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizon color value of 2 or 3 and is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nAn E horizon is present in some pedons that have not been cultivated. It has hue of 10YR, value or 4 or 5, and chroma of 3.  Texture is silt loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 6. The lower part has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 6 and is silty clay loam or silty clay. It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nA 2Ex (where present) and the upper part of the 2Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam or their gravelly analogues. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btx horizon has mottled colors with hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8. Textures include the gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogues, of silt loam, silty clay loam and clay loam. Rock fragments are often horizontally oriented and there is variable weakly or moderately expressed brittleness in 30 to 60 percent of the fine material. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, with iron depletions of lower chroma in some pedons. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, clay or silty clay or their gravelly to extremely gravelly or cobbly analogues. Reaction is strongly acid to mildly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family. Soils in similar families are the Creldon and Gerald series.  Both of these soils have fragipans. In addition, Creldon soils do not have an abrupt textural change and Gerald soils have an umbric epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Friendly soils are on broad concave sideslopes in heads of drainageways and on structural benches. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying loamy and clayey residuum from limestone. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 42 inches."

Hartwell soils are darker in the upper Bt horizon, do not have a 2Bt horizon and are higher on the landscape. Maplewood soils do not have an abrupt textural change and are lower on the landscape. Paintbrush soils do not have an abrupt textural change, are fine-loamy, and are browner in the upper Bt horizons. They are lower in the landscape."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was originally classified as an Albaquic Hapludalf. In the current edition of Soil Taxonomy, Fragiaquic keys out ahead of Albaquic.   This update of the series changes the classification from Albaquic to Fragiaquic.\nThe sequence and nomenclature of the materials may differ depending on whether the upper part of the dense material is considered to be a part of the residuum or part of the loess. Three or as many as four lithologic discontinuities could be designated. The clay bulge is so abrupt that despite the claypan properties, the weighted clay percentage borders fine-silty. In many pedons the upper Bt horizon has clay films of darker material that make the horizon appear mollic unless kneaded color is used.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 6 inches to 64 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Btx1, 2Btx2, 2Btx3, and 3Bt horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Sampled as University of Missouri soil characterization laboratory reference number M8615909.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
