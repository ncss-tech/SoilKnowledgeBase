  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness is measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 50 inches. Both the particle-size and series control sections contain less than 50 percent fine sand or very fine sand and more than 30 percent medium, coarse, and very coarse sand throughout.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the lower part of the solum in some pedons.  Reaction also ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum.  Carbonates are absent to more than 80 inches.  Redox accumulations are within 72 inches. Saturation occurs at a depth of 40 to 72 inches for some time in most years.\nSome wooded pedons have an O horizon of partially decomposed forest litter.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the Ap or A horizon is sand or loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture typically is sand or coarse sand but it is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand in the upper part in some pedons.  Bw horizons with spodic colors have pH greater than 5.9 or organic carbon content less than 0.6 percent or do not have an overlying albic horizon.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sand or coarse sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abbeylake, Cantlin, Champlain, Claire, Corliss, Danjay(T), Feldtman(T), Grayling, Hiawatha(T), Mahtomedi, Menahga, Nymore, Plainbo, Sartel, Serdon, Shawano, and Sunday series.  Related soils are the Brems, Croswell, Meehan, and Plainfield series.  All of these soils except the Cantlin and Hiawatha series, the moderately well drained phase of the Mahtomedi series, and the Brems, Croswell, and Meehan series do not have redox features or a water table within 6 feet.  Cantlin soils average 50 percent or more fine sand in the particle-size control section. Hiawatha soils have a thin loamy surface mantle. Mahtomedi soils typically average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Brems and Meehan soils have redox depletions within 40 inches and Brems and Plainfield soils are mesic. Croswell soils have a spodic horizon."

Friendship soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free periods ranges from about 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 670 to 1,950 feet."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas are used for cropland.  Much of the cropland is irrigated and used to grow specialty crops such as sweet corn, peas, snap beans, and potatoes.  Some areas are used for pastureland.  Some areas which were used for cropland have been allowed to revert to woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest commonly with some grass in the understory.  The most common trees are jack pine and northern pin oak with some red pine, eastern white pine, quaking aspen, and bigtooth aspen."
