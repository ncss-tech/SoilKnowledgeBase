  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. WLC-SDM-CLN",
  "REVDATE": "10/2018",
  "STATES": "LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Felicity series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils.  These soils formed in sandy coastal sediments on level and nearly level areas adjacent to gulf coastal beaches that are subject to flooding during storm tides. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to buried organic layers, or mineral horizons ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Sandy Ab horizons, where present, are typically at depths of 24 to 40 inches.  Silt plus clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from 3 to 25 percent.  Weatherable minerals in the sand and coarse silt fraction exceed 10 percent.  Soil reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline to a depth of 60 inches or more.  Salinity ranges from moderate to high and electrical conductivity (EC) ranges from 8 to 16 mmhos/cm throughout the 10- to 40-inch control section.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Shell and fragments of shell range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are at depths of 10 to 40 inches.  Shell and fragments of shell range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe Ab horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are Canaveral, Galveston, Mustang, Palm Beach and Voss series.  Voss and Galveston soils have higher color values in the C horizon.  Also, Voss soils have electrical conductivity (EC) less than 2 dS/m and are not inundated by salt water.  Canaveral and Palm Beach soils have less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the particle-size control section.  Mustang soils have color with chroma of 1 or 2 and are Aquents."

They flood rarely to frequently by salt water during storm tides.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Near the type location the average annual rainfall is about 67 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 70 degrees F."
