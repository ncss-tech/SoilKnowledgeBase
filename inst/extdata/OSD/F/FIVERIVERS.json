  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 9 inches (A, AB horizons).\nCambic horizon - from depths of 9 to 36 inches (Bw, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - from 11 to 36 inches (4 inches of the Bw horizon, and all of Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nAndic feature - from the mineral soil surface to 9 inches (A, AB horizons). Medial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties.\nEvidence of translocated clay - few faint clay films are present in this soil; however the clay increase is not significant enough to qualify as an argillic horizon.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nClassification revision 9/03 from fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Typic Dystrudepts to fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Andic Dystrudepts based on lab data and associated soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data available for S01OR-003-014, NSSL, Lincoln, NE, 5/02.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
