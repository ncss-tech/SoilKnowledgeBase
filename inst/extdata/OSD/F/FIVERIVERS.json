Medial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties.\nEvidence of translocated clay - few faint clay films are present in this soil; however the clay increase is not significant enough to qualify as an argillic horizon.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nClassification revision 9/03 from fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Typic Dystrudepts to fine-loamy, isotic, frigid Andic Dystrudepts based on lab data and associated soils."
