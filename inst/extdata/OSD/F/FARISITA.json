  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to soft weathered bedrock is less than 20 inches, and depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 10 to 35 percent by volume and are mainly pebbles and cobbles.  The soil is dominantly noncalcareous but some pedons have small discontinuous pockets of calcareous material.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 56 degrees F.  The soil ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe A and C horizons have a hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The fine earth fraction is usually sandy loam, but clay ranges from 10 to 25 percent, silt from 0 to 50 percent, and sand from 40 to 80 percent."
