Fanu soils formed in alluvium from welded tuff, with minor amounts of limestone at elevations of 1,700 to 2,050 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, and the frost-free season is about 90 to 110 days."
