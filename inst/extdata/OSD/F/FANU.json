  "OVERVIEW": "The Fanu series consists of very deep, well drained soils on inset fans, drainageways, and alluvial terraces. Fanu soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is 8 degrees C.",
