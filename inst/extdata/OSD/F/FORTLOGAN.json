  "OVERVIEW": "The Fortlogan series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or alluvium over residuum weathered from mudstone and siltstone.  These soils are on hills, fan remnants, and structural benches.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 320 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
