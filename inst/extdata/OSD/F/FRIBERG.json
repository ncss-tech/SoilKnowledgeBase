  "OVERVIEW": "The Friberg series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy colluvium and loamy glacial till.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 42 inches thick and includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The particle size control section ranges from 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine sand and coarser.  Rock fragments make up 1 to 3 percent, by volume, of the upper mantle and 3 to 10 percent, by volume, of the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.  It has ped coatings of fine sand grains and silt particles in the lower part of the A horizon in some pedons.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral, but in some pedons the upper part of the A horizon may be slightly alkaline because of erosion sediments from the adjacent slopes.\nSome pedons have an E horizon 2 to 6 inches thick.\nThe Btg  horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y; value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam high in sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy clay loam or loam high in sand content. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a 2Bkg horizon.\nThe 2Cg horizon has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
