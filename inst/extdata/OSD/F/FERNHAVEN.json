  "OVERVIEW": "The Fernhaven series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone.  Fernhaven soils are on mountainous sideslopes.  Slopes are 3 to 75 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 75 inches.",
