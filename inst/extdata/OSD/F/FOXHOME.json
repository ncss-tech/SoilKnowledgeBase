  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 11 to 30 inches.  The A and Bw horizons contain 0 to 20 percent rock fragments, the 2Bw horizon contains 35 to 75 percent and the 3C horizons contains less than 15 percent.  The rock fragments are of mixed lithology.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 19 inches in thickness.  The texture between depths of 10 inches and the top of the 3C horizon is sandy loam or coarser and averages 35 to 65 percent (by volume) of rock fragments.  The thickness of the sandy material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The 3C horizon typically contains 20 to 30 percent clay with an extreme range of 10 to 35 percent and commonly 20 to 45 percent fine sand and coarser with an extreme range of 50 percent.  Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less or a matrix with 2 chroma or less and redoximorphic concentrations with higher chroma are within a depth of 40 inches.\nThe A horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel by volume.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam or loam.  It has 0 to 20 percent rock fragments by volume.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bw horizons have 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The texture of the fine earth fraction is loamy sand, sand, coarse sand or loamy coarse sand.  It has 35 to 75 percent by volume rock fragments.  A 2C horizon is present in some pedons with similar range of colors and textures as the 2Bw.\nThe 3BCk and 3C horizons have 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They commonly have redoximorphic concentrations with higher chroma.  Texture is loam or clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silty clay loam or silt loam.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not have a 3BCk horizon.  A 3Bw or 3BC horizon is present in some pedons with similar range of colors and textures as the 3BCk and 3C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Foxhome soils have slightly convex or plane slopes on lake plains.  Slopes are less than 4 percent.  They commonly have somewhat elongated, narrow or irregularly shaped landforms.  These soils formed in sandy and sandy-skeletal water sorted sediments over loamy till or loamy lacustrine sediments of Late Wisconsin Age on lake plains.   Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 44 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 24 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 140.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1600 feet above sea level."
