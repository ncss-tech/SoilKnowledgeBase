  "STATES": "AL,FL,GA,SC",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Foxworth series consists of very deep, moderately well to somewhat excessively drained, rapid to very rapid permeable soils on broad uplands and side slopes.  They formed in sandy marine or eolian sediments in the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A), The Eastern Gulf Coast Flatwoods (MLRA 152A), The Atlantic Coast Flatwoods (153A) and the Tidewater Area (153B).  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of sand exceeds 80 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, chroma of 3 to 8.  Splotches or pockets of uncoated sand grains range from few to many but are not indicative of wetness.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand.\nThe lower part of the C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, chroma of 3 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, gray, and red range from few to many. Depth to redoximorphic features is commonly 45 to 60 inches but ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  Few to many uncoated sand grains are in these horizons.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, chroma of 1 to 2. Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, red, and yellow range from few to many.  Few to many uncoated sand grains are in these horizons. Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Alaga, Bigbee, Cainhoy, Darden, Glentosh, Lakeland, McNeely, Tonkawa, Turkey, and Wando series in the same family.  Alaga and Darden soils have more than 10 percent silt plus clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section. Bigbee soils have a water table at 20 to 40 inches for short periods of time and are subject to flooding.  Cainhoy soils are better drained and have Bh horizons below depths of 80 inches.  Glentosh and Tonkawa soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods of time.  Lakeland and McNeely soils do not have a seasonal water table within a depth of 80 inches.  In addition, McNeely soils have Bw horizons and less than 5 percent clay in the control section.  Wando soils have loamy fine sand or fine sand to a depth of 40 to 60 inches and commonly contain more silt plus clay."
