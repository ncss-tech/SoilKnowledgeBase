  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of sand exceeds 80 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, chroma of 3 to 8.  Splotches or pockets of uncoated sand grains range from few to many but are not indicative of wetness.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand.\nThe lower part of the C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, chroma of 3 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, gray, and red range from few to many. Depth to redoximorphic features is commonly 45 to 60 inches but ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  Few to many uncoated sand grains are in these horizons.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, chroma of 1 to 2. Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, red, and yellow range from few to many.  Few to many uncoated sand grains are in these horizons. Texture is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Alaga, Bigbee, Cainhoy, Darden, Glentosh, Lakeland, McNeely, Tonkawa, Turkey, and Wando series in the same family.  Alaga and Darden soils have more than 10 percent silt plus clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section. Bigbee soils have a water table at 20 to 40 inches for short periods of time and are subject to flooding.  Cainhoy soils are better drained and have Bh horizons below depths of 80 inches.  Glentosh and Tonkawa soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods of time.  Lakeland and McNeely soils do not have a seasonal water table within a depth of 80 inches.  In addition, McNeely soils have Bw horizons and less than 5 percent clay in the control section.  Wando soils have loamy fine sand or fine sand to a depth of 40 to 60 inches and commonly contain more silt plus clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Foxworth soils are on broad uplands and side slopes leading to drainageways.  They formed in sandy marine or eolian sediments.  The climate is warm and humid.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The average annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 54 to 48 inches."

In addition, Alapaha soils are poorly drained, Fuquay soils are well drained and Leefield soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Blanton, Bonifay and Troup soils have sandy surface and subsurface horizons 40 to 80 inches thick.  In addition, Bonifay soils are well drained and Troup soils are somewhat excessively drained.  Alapaha, Bonifay, Fuquay and Leefield soils have 5 percent or more plinthite in the argillic horizon within depths of 60 inches."
