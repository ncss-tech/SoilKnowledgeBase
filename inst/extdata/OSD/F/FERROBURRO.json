    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 55 degrees F.  The soils are neutral or slightly alkaline throughout. Clay averages 10 to 18 percent in the particle size control section.  The soils are dry in all parts from mid-July to November for about 110 consecutive days and moist in all parts from January to April for about 90 consecutive days.  The soil temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F. from mid-March to December for about 260 days, and warmer than 47 degrees F. for 150 to 190 days.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, or 7.5YR 5/2, and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with gravelly or cobbly modifiers.  Rock fragments 2 to 10 mm in size range from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 6/4, or 7.5YR 6/6 and moist color of 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4 or 7.5YR 4/6.  It is gravelly or cobbly sandy loam.  Rock fragments 2 to 15 mm in size range from 15 to 35 percent."

Elevations range from 5,000 to 7,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot, dry summers with infrequent thunder showers of short duration and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.; the average January temperature is 35 degrees F.; and the average annual July temperature is 75 degrees F.  The frost free season is 185 to 225 days."

Huntmount soils have a fine, loamy argillic horizon and are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Mexispring soils have an ochric epipedon and have an aridic moisture regime.  Panamint soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Ulida soils have an ochric epipedon and an argillic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (A1 and A2 horizons and part of the C horizon).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 14 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nThis soil is in an intergrade to an aridic moisture regime.  The number of days the soil is dry above 41 degrees F. is only slightly less than one half of the time.  Future study should evaluate whether this series has an aridic moisture regime that borders on xeric and should be reclassified to the subgroup of Torriorthentic Haploxerolls.  The nature of the weathered bedrock should also be evaluated to determine whether slaking is typical for the material.  If the material does not slake, it would fit the concept for paralithic materials and not densic materials.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
