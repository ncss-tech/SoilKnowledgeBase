The poorly drained Cyclone and Treaty soils are on lower landscape positions and have mollic epipedons. The moderately well drained Miami soils, the well drained Russell soils, and the moderately well drained Xenia soils form a drainage sequence with the Fincastle soils. They are on higher lying positions on summits, or on lower lying, more sloping positions on shoulders and backslopes. The moderately well drained Williamstown soils are also on higher lying positions on summits, or on lower lying, more sloping positions on shoulders and backslopes."
