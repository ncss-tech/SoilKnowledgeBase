  "OVERVIEW": "The Fincastle series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep to dense till. Fincastle soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy till. They are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
