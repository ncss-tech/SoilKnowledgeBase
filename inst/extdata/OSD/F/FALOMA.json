The thickness of the solum and depth to sand range from 14 to 20 inches. The soils are slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has faint to prominent mottles. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Mottles are distinct or prominent. This horizon is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. It has weak or moderate structure.\nThe 2C horizon ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand. Redox concentrations are distinct or prominent. Up to 10 percent gravel are in some pedons."
