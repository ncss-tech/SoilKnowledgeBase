  "OVERVIEW": "The Fondis series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in thin eolian materials 1 to 2 feet thick overlying coarser textured outwash materials derived from arkose deposits of the Denver and Arapahoe or similar formations.  These soils are on tablelands or uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thin E horizons occur in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 19 inches thick.  Content of organic carbon normally ranges from .7 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with depth.  The soils are 80 to 100 percent base saturated.  Cation exchange capacity ranges from 70 to 90 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F.  and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 79 degrees F.  Length of time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F. normally ranges from about 230 to 305 days.  Length of time (cumulative) that the soil is moist in some part of the moisture control section while the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. normally ranges from 56 to 152 days but in most years it is not less than one-fourth or more than one-half of the time that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It usually has granular or crumb primary structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft to slightly hard. It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7, 2 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  They are typically silty clay, with 35 to 50 percent clay, 20 to 50 percent silt and 5 to 40 percent sand, with less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  These horizons usually have prismatic primary structure, but have angular blocky structure in some pedons.  They are slightly acid to moderately alkaline, becoming more alkaline with depth.\nThe 2Bt horizon has the same range in color as the Bt horizon.  It is heavy clay loam or clay with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand, much of which is medium or coarse angular granitic sand.  This horizon is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline\nand has visible secondary calcium carbonate in structural cracks in the lower part, although interiors of peds are noncalcareous.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is a loam or clay loam with less than 35 percent clay.  This horizon is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline and has 4 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent of the fine earth fraction."

Weld soils lack a lithologic discontinuity within the solum, and have sola 15 to 40 inches thick."
