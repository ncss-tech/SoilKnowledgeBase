They are in linear slope positions at elevations of 322 to 1206 meters (1056 to 3957 feet) in predominately south and southwest facing aspects. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 2032 millimeters (49 to 80 inches). Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 15 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F).
