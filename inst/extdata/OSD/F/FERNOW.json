  "OVERVIEW": "The Fernow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice.  Fernow soils are in glaciated valleys and adjacent mountain slopes.  Elevations range from 3,000 to 6,000 feet.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 90 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
