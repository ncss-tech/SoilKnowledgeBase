The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 12 to 15 percent for air dried samples, and 0 to 25 percent pumice.  The lower part of the particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.85 g/cc, 50 to 85 percent pumice.  Depth to pumice range from 20 to 30 inches.   The Bhs horizon is 3 to 6 percent organic carbon.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 through 3 dry, 2 or 3 moist.

Elevations range from 3,000 to 6,000 feet.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice from a number of ash falls.  Primary source for a majority of the volcanic ejecta is Glacier Peak.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 75 to 100 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F and the July temperature is about 59 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 42 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is 100 to 130 days."
