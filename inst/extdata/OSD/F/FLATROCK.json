  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lobdell and Weaver series. In addition, the Eel series is in a closely related family. Lobdell soils have rock fragments that are predominantly of sandstone, siltstone, or shale lithology. Weaver soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Eel soils are in the superactive cation-exchange activity class and have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Flatrock soils are on flood plains along streams in areas of Wisconsin glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in recent alluvium washed mainly from areas of calcareous loamy drift or lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 152 to 274 meters (500 to 900 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Defiance and Shoals soils and the very poorly drained Sloan and Wabasha soils are on flats and in depressions and abandoned meanders. The well drained Knoxdale soil is a member of the same drainage sequence and occupies higher or better drained landscape positions. The moderately well drained Medway soils and the well drained Rossburg soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscape positions along major rivers and streams."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the subsoil and high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum."
