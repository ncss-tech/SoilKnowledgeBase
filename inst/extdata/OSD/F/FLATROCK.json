Lobdell soils have rock fragments that are predominantly of sandstone, siltstone, or shale lithology. Weaver soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Eel soils are in the superactive cation-exchange activity class and have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 152 to 274 meters (500 to 900 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Defiance and Shoals soils and the very poorly drained Sloan and Wabasha soils are on flats and in depressions and abandoned meanders. The well drained Knoxdale soil is a member of the same drainage sequence and occupies higher or better drained landscape positions. The moderately well drained Medway soils and the well drained Rossburg soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landscape positions along major rivers and streams."
