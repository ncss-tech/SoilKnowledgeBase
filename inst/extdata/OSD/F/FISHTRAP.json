    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean winter and mean summer temperature is 12 to 16 degrees F.  These soils are usually saturated with water unless drained.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.  The organic material is 16 to 51 inches thick.  Fibers are mostly from grasses and sedges, but pedons contain up to 15 percent wood fragments.  Fiber content ranges from 10 to 50 percent unrubbed and 2 to 15 percent rubbed.  Thin discontinuous layers of volcanic ash and diatomaceous earth (1/2 to 2 inches thick) are between 24 and 48 inches in some pedons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 2 through 5 dry, and chroma of 0 through 3 moist and dry.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y,or N/, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry.  It is loamy sand, sand, or gravelly sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fishtrap soils are in depressional areas on outwash terraces.  Elevation is near sea level to 600 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in herbaceous and woody organic deposits overlying glaciofluvial deposits.  Shalcar soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost- free season is 150 to 190 days."
