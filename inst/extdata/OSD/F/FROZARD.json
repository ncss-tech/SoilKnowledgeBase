    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to about 80 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Ped coatings have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam. Iron accumulations in shades of brown and iron depletions in shades of gray are common to many. The exchangeable sodium percentage averages from 5 to 15 percent in the upper 40 cm. of the Bt horizon. Reaction ranges from neutral through strongly alkaline. Sand content ranges from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.

Acy soils have less than 5 percent exchangeable sodium in the upper 40 cm of the argillic horizon and do not have very hard or very firm consistency in the Bt and BC horizons. Deerford soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the lower part of the B horizon. Dundee and Idee soils have more than 10 percent sand in the B horizon and are more acid. Essen and Galvez soils do not have dark peds coats in the upper part of the Bt horizon. In addition, Galvez soils are more acid in the B horizon. Fountain soils dominantly have chroma of 1 in all subhorizons between the base of the Ap and 30 inches. Fred soils have dominant chroma of more than 2 in the matrix of the B horizon and do not have more than 50 percent ped coatings that have chromas of 2 or less. Hebert soils are more acid and have an argillic horizon that has redder hue. Jeanerette soils have a mollic epipedon. Kurk soils are more acid and do not have calcium carbonate concretions in the solum. McGehee soils have a 2B horizon and have redder hue. Patoutville soils have red iron accumulations in the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Frozard soils are on Pleistocene age terraces at low elevations. They formed in loess that probably has been influenced by Mississippi River alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F. near the type location and the mean annual precipitation is about 58 inches. The climate is warm and humid."

Nebraska (S79LA-097-005).  Fertility analyses were run on samples from the Frozard survey area typical pedon in Vermillion Parish by LSU (S84LA-113-014) and are published in the Soil Survey of Vermillion Parish, Louisiana.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
