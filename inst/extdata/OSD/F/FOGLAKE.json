The series control section does not have rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam. It has prominent or distinct redoximorphic features. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have E/B or B/E horizons with colors and textures similar to the Eg and Btg horizons. These horizons do not classify as glossic.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. It has faint to prominent redoximorphic features. It has few to many, distinct or faint discontinuous clay films. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have Bk horizons.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. It has faint to prominent redoximorphic features. It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Cg or C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. This horizon is varved in some pedons. Soft threads or rounded masses of calcium carbonate are in many pedons. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 625 to 750 mm. Frost free days range from 90 to 140. Elevation above sea level ranges from 300 to 500 meters."
