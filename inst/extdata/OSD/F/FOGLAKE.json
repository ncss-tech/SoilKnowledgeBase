It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam. It has prominent or distinct redoximorphic features. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have E/B or B/E horizons with colors and textures similar to the Eg and Btg horizons. These horizons do not classify as glossic.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. It has faint to prominent redoximorphic features. It has few to many, distinct or faint discontinuous clay films.
