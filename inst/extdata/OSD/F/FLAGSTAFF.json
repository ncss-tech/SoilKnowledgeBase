  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Flagstaff soils are on lakebeds. They occur adjacent to slight depressions. These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived mainly from volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,375 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Fort Rock, Horning, Morehouse, and Tonor soils. Fort Rock soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have mollic epipedons, and are on adjacent lake terraces. Horning and Morehouse soils are ashy, have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section, and occur on stable dunes. Tonor soils are ashy, have cambic horizons, and are on summit positions of lake terraces."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained; negligible surface runoff; very slow permeability; low saturated hydraulic conductivity in surface horizons over slow permeability: moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity in lower horizons. Episaturation is present with perched free water between the soil surface and 25 cm (very shallow free water occurrence class) from January through March. Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory. Some small areas of these soils are susceptible to occasional ponding for brief duration from January through March with water a few inches deep. Most areas of these soils do not pond water in normal years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nAlbic horizon - The zone from the soil surface to 10 cm (AEn horizon).\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (AEn horizon and part of the Bn1 horizon).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 10 to 30 cm (Bn1 and Bn2 horizons).\nAquic conditions - The conditions of episaturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features between the soil surface and 25 cm at certain times during normal years (AEn and Bn1 horizons and part of the Bn2 horizon).\nSalic horizon - The zone from 30 to 109 cm (BCknz and Cknqz horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 30 to 152 cm (BCknz, Cknqz, and Ckq horizons).\nParticle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (BCknz horizon and parts of the Bn2 and Cknqz horizons).\nThe revision of April 2001 represented both a change in the taxonomic classification and the series type location from the prior description. This revision updated the taxonomic class from Loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid, shallow Haploxeralfic Argidurids. Changes in the series concept were made to clarify the soil depth class, particle-size class, mineralogy class, and presence of diagnostic horizons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data is available for two nearby pedons sampled in 1954 and analyzed at the soils lab in Riverside, CA as S54Ore. 19-1, samples # 5573-5580 and S54Ore. 19-2, samples # 5581-5588. Selected data such as electrical conductivity, calcium carbonate equivalent, and saturated soil paste extractable sodium, calcium, and magnesium are available. Sodium adsorption ratios are calculated from this data. Data for these pedons are not stored in the SSL database at Lincoln, NE.\nVolcanic glass content determined locally by optical grain counts using a polarizing petrographic microscope.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
