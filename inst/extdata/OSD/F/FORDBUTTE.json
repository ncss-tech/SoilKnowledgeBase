    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fordbutte soils are on toeslopes below cuestas and knolls of undulating plateaus.  Fordbutte soils formed in alluvium, thin eolian deposits, and residuum derived from Cretaceous siltstone, sandstone, and shale.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 6,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Ravola and Hamburn soils are very deep, stratified, and occur on flood plains.  Littlehat soils lack cambic horizons and are strongly saline-sodic. Persayo soils are shallow to soft bedrock on adjacent footslopes.  Tsebitai soils are coarse-silty and very deep."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil to a depth of about 4 inches (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - The zone from about 4 to 14 inches (Bw horizon).\nParalithic contact - The presence of soft sedimentary bedrock at about 34 inches.\nGreat group rationale - The Bk and BCk horizons do not qualify as calcic horizons because there is not a 5 percent decrease by weight, of calcium carbonate equivalent in the C horizons and the underlying paralithic contacts (Cr layers).\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The series type location was sampled for full characterization by the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) as pedon S86NM-045-011.\nSalinity values were also determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
