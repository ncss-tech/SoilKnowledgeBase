    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, 6 or more dry, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 6. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon and BC horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6 and mottles with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. The Bt horizon is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.\nThe BC horizon is sandy loam or loamy sand. Reaction is very strongly acid to medium acid. Some pedons have B/E horizons, but the silt coatings (E) are thin and discontinuous on the faces of the peds.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It commonly is stratified sand and loamy sand with thin strata of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bathel and Bolling series. Similar series in other families are the Askew, Broseley, Center, Coteau, Fred, Frizzell, Longview, Tutwiler, and Vidrine. Bathel soils are somewhat poorly drained. Bolling soils have an active CEC/clay ratio. Askew, Center, Coteau, Fred, and Longview soils are fine-silty. Broseley soils lack mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 30 inches. Frizzell, Tutwiler, and Vidrine soils are coarse-silty."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Farrenburg soils occupy nearly level areas of natural levees or terraces in the Mississippi River Valley. Slope gradients range from 0 to about 3 percent. These soils formed in loamy alluvium. The mean annual temperature varies from 58 to 64 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation varies from 45 to 54 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the competing Broseley series, and the Bosket, Canalou, Dundee, Gideon, Lilbourn, Sikeston, and Wardell series. Broseley soils are on similar landscapes. Bosket soils are better drained and are higher in the landscape than Farrenburg soils. Canalou soils are on similar landscapes but do not have argillic horizons. Dundee, Gideon, Lilbourn, Sikeston, and Wardell soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less and are on nearly level or level areas below the Farrenburg soils."
