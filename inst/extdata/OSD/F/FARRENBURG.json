  "OVERVIEW": "The Farrenburg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on nearly level areas of natural levees or terraces in the Mississippi River Valley. These soils have moderate permeability in the solum and rapid permeability below. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 50 inches.",

It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 through 6. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon and BC horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6 and mottles with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. The Bt horizon is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.\nThe BC horizon is sandy loam or loamy sand. Reaction is very strongly acid to medium acid. Some pedons have B/E horizons, but the silt coatings (E) are thin and discontinuous on the faces of the peds.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It commonly is stratified sand and loamy sand with thin strata of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral."

Bathel soils are somewhat poorly drained. Bolling soils have an active CEC/clay ratio. Askew, Center, Coteau, Fred, and Longview soils are fine-silty. Broseley soils lack mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 30 inches. Frizzell, Tutwiler, and Vidrine soils are coarse-silty."

Canalou soils are on similar landscapes but do not have argillic horizons. Dundee, Gideon, Lilbourn, Sikeston, and Wardell soils have dominant chroma of 2 or less and are on nearly level or level areas below the Farrenburg soils."
