Cassiro soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Nammoth soils are dominated by boulders and are moderately acid or slightly acid in the particle-size control section.  Pickup soils have a 15 percent absolute clay increase between the Bt1 and Bt2 horizons and have 50 to 60 percent clay in the Bt2 horizon.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fivesprings soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt or andesite.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,500 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches including annual snowfall of 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
