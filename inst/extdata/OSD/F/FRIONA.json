  "OVERVIEW": "The Friona series consists of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon. They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian sediments from the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F)",
