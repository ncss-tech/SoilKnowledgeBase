  "OVERVIEW": "The Fogg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy glacial deposits on moraines and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
