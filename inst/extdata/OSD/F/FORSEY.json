The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 57 to 59 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days or more within the 3 month period following the summer solstice and are moist in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days or more within the 3 month period following the winter solstice, in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist.  It is cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, or cobbly sandy loam.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very cobbly loam, very cobbly sandy clay loam or very cobbly clay loam has 18 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very cobbly sandy loam , very cobbly loam or very cobbly sandy clay loam and has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. The C horizon is noncalcareous or slightly calcareous with weak horizons and moderately alkaline."

These soils occur on old dissected alluvial fans and mountain slopes and formed in alluvium, residuum and colluvium derived from intermediate igneous rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid, with an average annual precipitation of 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The frost free season is 65 to 75 days."
