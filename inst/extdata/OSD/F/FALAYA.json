Depth to the upper boundary of argillic or fragipan horizons of a buried soil, if present, ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches.  Total sand content in the control section is less than 10 percent.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer where limed.\nThe Ap horizon, and A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 with iron accumulations and depletions in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Cg and the Bg, Egb, Bxb, and Btb horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  These horizons have few to common iron accumulations and depletions in shades of yellow, gray, and brown.  Texture is silt or silt loam."
