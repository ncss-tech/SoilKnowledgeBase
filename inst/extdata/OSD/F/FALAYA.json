  "OVERVIEW": "The Falaya series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in silty alluvium from loess.  These level to nearly level soils are wide flood plains in the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands, MLRA 134.  They are subject to flooding and are saturated with water at 1 to 2 feet during periods of high rainfall.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 with iron accumulations and depletions in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Cg and the Bg, Egb, Bxb, and Btb horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  These horizons have few to common iron accumulations and depletions in shades of yellow, gray, and brown.  Texture is silt or silt loam."
