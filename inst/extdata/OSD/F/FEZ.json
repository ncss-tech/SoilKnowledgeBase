  "OVERVIEW": "The Fez series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuffs.  The Fez soils are on side slopes of rock piedmont remnants and hills.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
