  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 40 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid throughout the solum, except for the surface layer in areas that have been limed.  Total content of sand in the particle-size control section ranges from 10 to 25 percent, commonly increasing with depth, but content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent. Gray mottles are present within 16 inches of the soil surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Where value is 3, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles, in shades of brown or gray range from few to many.  Fine or very fine black and brown concretions range from none to common.  The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silt or silty clay loam.  Mottles in shades of brown or gray range from few to many.  Fine and very fine black and brown concretions range from none to common.\nThe Bt part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The E part has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have a grayish E horizon or a mottled E/B horizon.  Vertical tongues of E material range in width from .25 inch to 2 inches and comprise 15 to 30 percent of the horizon.  Texture of the Bt part is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Texture of the E part is silt loam.  Brownish mottles range from few to many and from fine to coarse.\nThe 2Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6, or it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam.  Mottles in shades of brown and gray range from few to many.  Total sand content is typically greater than 25 percent.\nSome pedons have a 2B or 2BC horizon below the 2Btx horizon.  Where present, they have the same range in colors and reaction as the 2Btx horizon.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no soils in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Bude, Calloway, Hatchie, Necessity, Olivier, Prentiss, Pheba, Taft, and Woodmont series.  Bude, Calloway, Necessity, and Olivier, soils have mixed mineralogy.  Prentiss, Pheba, and Taft soils have a base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Woodmont soils do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipan and formed in limestone residuum."

These soils formed in a silty mantle, less than 4 feet thick, and the underlying loamy sediments.  Climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 55 to 65 inches."
