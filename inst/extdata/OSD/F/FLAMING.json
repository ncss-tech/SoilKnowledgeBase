  "OVERVIEW": "The Flaming series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy sediments on lake plains, lake plains and till plains.  These soils have rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 16 inches.  The depth of mollic colors is less than 18 inches.  The depth to carbonates typically is 40 to 60 inches or more but in some pedons is at depths as shallow as 20 inches.  These soils do not have rock fragments to depths of 40 inches or more.  Unless artificially drained, these soils are estimated to be saturated with water in the lower part of the 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section for significant periods in most years.  The average texture in the particle-size control section is fine sand.  The particle-size control section averages more than 45 percent fine and very fine sand, less than 35 percent medium and coarser sand and less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  There are no rock fragments.  The reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the upper part and moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for as long as 20 to 35 consecutive days for the 120 days following the summer solstice.  It is also not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 to 5 dry and a chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.   The A horizon is loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR in the upper part and 10YR or 2.5Y in the lower part, value 3 to 5 and chroma is 2 to 4.  Value of 3 is restricted to the upper part.  Some pedons have horizons with a value and chroma of 3.5 or less extending a few inches below depths of 16 inches, but such horizons contain less than 1 percent organic matter.  Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less or redoximorphic concentrations with higher chroma in a matrix with chroma of 2 or less are shallower than depths of 40 inches.  The B horizon is fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand.\nThe matrix of the C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4.  It commonly has redox features, especially in the upper part.  It commonly is fine sand but in some pedons sand is in the lower part. The C horizon ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline."

Falsen soils have less than 45 percent fine and very fine sand, more than 35 percent medium and coarse sand and more than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  Hecla soils have mollic colors to depths of more than 18 inches.  Osakis soils have 10 to 70 percent rock fragments in the series control section.  Radium soils have 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Walum soils have dominantly shale in the sand-sized fraction. Weeding soils occur at elevations of over 4,200 feet, contain carbonates at or near the surface and are in a drier climate."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils typically are on plane or slightly convex positions, but some are on slightly concave positions, and are on level or nearly level glacial lake plains, lake plains, and till plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  Flaming soils formed in deep sandy deposits of lacustrine and/or aeolian origin.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 43 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 130.  Elevation is 785 feet to 1350 feet above sea level."

All of these soils developed in deep sandy deposits of similar texture.  The Arveson, Fossum, Hamar, and Rosewood soils are poorly and somewhat poorly drained and are on lower lying positions.  The well drained Maddock soils are on higher lying or more sloping positions.  Poppleton soils have thinner dark colored surface horizons.  The somewhat poorly and moderately well drained Ulen soils are on similar positions and have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches."
