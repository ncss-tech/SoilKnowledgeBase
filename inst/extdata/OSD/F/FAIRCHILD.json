  "OVERVIEW": "The Fairchild series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils moderately deep to a paralithic contact with interbedded sandstone and shale.  They formed in siliceous sandy alluvium and loamy residuum on pediments. Permeability is rapid or very rapid in the sandy alluvium, moderately slow or moderate in the loamy residuum, and very slow to moderately slow in the interbedded sandstone and shale. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth in this paragraph are measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Thickness of the solum and depth to the paralithic contact with interbedded sandstone and shale range from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the sandy alluvium and depth to residuum from interbedded sandstone and shale ranges from 15 to 39 inches.  The thickness and arrangement of layers in the residuum is extremely variable.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent throughout the argillic horizon.  Coarse fragments are mostly sandstone channers but, in some places, these soils occur near higher lying glacial soils and igneous fragments are in the upper part of some pedons.  Volume of gravel or sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle.  Volume of sandstone channers ranges from 3 to 15 percent in the residuum. Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the sandy mantle, but it ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the residuum.  Redox concentrations are in the albic or spodic horizons within a depth of 20 inches.  Saturation occurs within 20 inches at some time in most years.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral in hue.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2.  The O horizon is a layer of partially decomposed litter.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A or Ap horizon is sand or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It has texture like the Bhs horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Thin subhorizons of coarser or finer texture are in some pedons.\nThe 2Cr horizon has hue of 2.5YR. 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 6."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The water table is perched on bedrock (2Cr).  This water table technically fits neither the definition of epi-saturation nor of endo-saturation.  We have suggested to the classification staff at NSSC that the definition of epi-saturation be expanded to include water tables perched on bedrock.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from 1 to 12 inches (A, E); albic horizon - from 4 to 12 inches (E); spodic horizon - from 12 to 19 inches (Bhs, Bs); argillic horizon - from 27 to 33 inches (2Bt); aquic feature - redox features and saturation in the spodic horizon within 20 inches; siliceous feature - less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the sandy alluvium (0.2 to 20 mm fraction); ultic feature - base saturation (by sum of cations) less than 35 percent throughout the argillic horizon."
