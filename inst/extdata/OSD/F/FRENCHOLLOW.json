Ant Flat soils have secondary lime within 35 inches of the surface and do not have cracks during the year. Dutchcanyon soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and have a carbonatic mineralogy. Joes soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section and are calcareous to the surface. Yeates Hollow soils have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section. Ant Flat, Dutchcanyon and Yeates Hollow soils are on hillsides with generally east or south aspects adjacent to Frenchollow soils. Joes soils are on terraces generally below Frenchollow soils."
