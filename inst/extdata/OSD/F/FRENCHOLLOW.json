  "OVERVIEW": "The Frenchollow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty alluvium from mixed sources. They are on hills and terraces. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. Permeability is very slow. Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Yeates Hollow soils have a clayey-skeletal particle-size control section. Ant Flat, Dutchcanyon and Yeates Hollow soils are on hillsides with generally east or south aspects adjacent to Frenchollow soils. Joes soils are on terraces generally below Frenchollow soils."
