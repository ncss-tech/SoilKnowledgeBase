Previous competitors prior to the Seventh Edition, 1996 version of Keys to Soil Taxonomy are the Akhoni and Potagannissing series.\nAkhoni soils have particle-size control sections dominated by fine sand.\nAnsari and Corpening soils are calcareous and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.\nFalcon soils formed in arkosic sandstone and have greater than 35 percent fine sand and coarser.\nPotagannissing soils are very shallow, have a mean annual precipitation of about 30 inches, and are underlain by limestone."
