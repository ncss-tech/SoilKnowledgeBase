  "OVERVIEW": "The Frewa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Frewa soils are on fan skirts.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
