  "BYREV": "Rev. TJH/JPP/TWH",
  "REVDATE": "08/2000",
  "STATES": "CO,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fughes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived principally from shale, and interbedded sandstone and shale. The Fughes soils are on alluvial fans, terraces, valley sides, draws, and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Mean annual precipitation is revised from 15-24 inches to 18-24 inches. These changes bring the series concept in line with the original series concept.\nThe 2/99 revision changed the family mineralogy class name from montmorillonitic to smectitic, and changed the allowed depth to a lithic contact from greater than 40 inches to greater than 60 inches."
