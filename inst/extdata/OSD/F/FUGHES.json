Mean annual precipitation is revised from 15-24 inches to 18-24 inches. These changes bring the series concept in line with the original series concept.\nThe 2/99 revision changed the family mineralogy class name from montmorillonitic to smectitic, and changed the allowed depth to a lithic contact from greater than 40 inches to greater than 60 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
