  "OVERVIEW": "The Fortbenton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or eolian material over glacial till, glaciofluvial, or glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on stream terraces and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
