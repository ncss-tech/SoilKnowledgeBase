  "OVERVIEW": "The Furshur series consists of shallow to a duripan well drained soils\nformed in residuum and slope alluvium from rhyolite.  Furshur soils are\non mountain sides and have slopes to 2 to 60 percent.  Permeability is\nvery slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and\naverage annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
