  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist, but is dry throughout the control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is greater than 60 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments are predominantly volcanic in origin and are in various stages of decomposition dependent upon lithology.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 40 to 60 percent total coarse fragments, with 20 to 35 percent gravel and 20 to 35 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is extremely cobbly loam or clay loam, or extremely gravelly clay loam, averaging 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 20 to 50 percent gravel and 20 to 40 percent cobbles.  Clay films are predominantly faint or distinct.  Variegated colors are common throughout as a result of differential weathering of the rock fragments"

Bluesprin, Bobbitt, and Sallyann soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact and have 47 to 52 degrees F. mean annual soil temperature.  Briedwell soils lack an argillic horizon.  Keuterville soils have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F., formed in part from loess, and have 35 to 50 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Tekoa and Vilot soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

The soils formed in mixed medium textured gravelly and cobbly alluvium.  Winters are cool and moist and summers are warm and dry.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. and the annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."
