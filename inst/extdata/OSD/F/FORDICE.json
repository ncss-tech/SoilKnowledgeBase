The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is greater than 60 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments are predominantly volcanic in origin and are in various stages of decomposition dependent upon lithology.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 40 to 60 percent total coarse fragments, with 20 to 35 percent gravel and 20 to 35 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is extremely cobbly loam or clay loam, or extremely gravelly clay loam, averaging 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has 20 to 50 percent gravel and 20 to 40 percent cobbles.  Clay films are predominantly faint or distinct.  Variegated colors are common throughout as a result of differential weathering of the rock fragments"
