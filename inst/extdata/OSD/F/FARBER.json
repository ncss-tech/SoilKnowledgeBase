  "OVERVIEW": "The Farber series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess mixed with residuum and colluvium from metasedimentary rock. They are in uplands and have slopes of 35 to 65 percent. The average precipitation is about 26 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

This series has mainly been correlated to Ardenvoir and Minaloosa series components."
