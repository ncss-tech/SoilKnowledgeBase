  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for about 60 to 70 consecutive days during the summer.  The soils are not usually saturated throughout but are saturated within 40 inches of the surface during most of the spring and early summer (about 90 to 110 days) unless artificially drained.  Mottles of chroma of 2 or less are within 30 inches of the surface but are not immediately below the mollic epipedon.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and has less than 15 percent rock fragments.  The organic matter content decreases regularly with depth to a level of 0.5 percent or less within 50 inches of the surface.  The solum is 15 to 25 inches thick.  It ranges from noncalcareous to moderately calcareous, but is not calcareous throughout.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 20 to 33 inches.  Depth to the lakelaid sediments is 18 to 30 inches.  Some pedons are saline.  The Ap horizon or the upper 7-inch layer when mixed has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4.5 to 5.5 dry and 2.5 to 3.5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The upper 2- to 4-inch layer is platy, granular, or (and) vesicular.  The B (cambic) horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or 2.  It is medium to moderately fine textured and contains 24 to 30 percent clay.  This horizon has weak prismatic to weak subangular blocky or weak granular structure.  The IIC and IIIC horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 through 8, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are heavy silty clay loam, silty clay or clay."

Chino and Landlow soils have a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 59 degrees F.  Chino and Hussman soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Fulmer soils are saturated throughout unless drained and have mottles in or immediately below the mollic epipedon.  Quenzer soils lack a mollic epipedon and a calcic horizon."
