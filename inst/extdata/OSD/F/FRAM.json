  "OVERVIEW": "The Fram series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in till or water sorted sediments over till. These soils are on till plains, moraines and lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 17 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The top of the calcic horizon is at depths of less than 16 inches, and in some pedons the lower part of the mollic epipedon qualifies as part of the calcic horizon.  The soil contains 1 to 10 percent rock fragments.  Some pedons contain stones.  Some pedons are saline.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  Some pedons have Ak or ABk horizons.\nThe Bk horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4. It typically is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. Redoximorphic features are in some to all parts of the Bk and C horizons. Some pedons have Bky or BCk horizons.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon.  It typically has a coarse textured lag line at the top."

The climate is cool, subhumid, with a mean annual air temperature ranging from 36 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranging from 15 to 22 inches.  The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 750 to 2300 feet."

Emrick, Heimdal, and Ortonville soils are on better drained, higher lying positions. Hedman soils are on adjacent, poorly drained flats. Parnell and Tonka soils occupy very poorly and poorly drained areas in depressions. They have argillic horizons. Vallers soils on poorly drained rims of the depressions."
