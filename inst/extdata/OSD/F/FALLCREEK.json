  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Clay content in the particle-size control section averages 12 to 18 percent but individual subhorizons in some pedons have more than 18 percent.  Volume of gravel typically ranges from 3 to 15 percent throughout the pedon but ranges to 35 percent in individual subhorizons in some pedons.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Uncultivated pedons have A horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap or A horizon is sandy loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is sandy loam or loam.\nFallcreek soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both.) The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam or loam."

The remainder is in forest or sparsely wooded tracts used for pasture or as wildlife areas.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous forest. Common trees are northern red oak, sugar maple, red maple, white ash, and American basswood."
