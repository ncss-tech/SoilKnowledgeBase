  "OVERVIEW": "The Fallcreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial till on ground moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Clay content in the particle-size control section averages 12 to 18 percent but individual subhorizons in some pedons have more than 18 percent.  Volume of gravel typically ranges from 3 to 15 percent throughout the pedon but ranges to 35 percent in individual subhorizons in some pedons.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Uncultivated pedons have A horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.
