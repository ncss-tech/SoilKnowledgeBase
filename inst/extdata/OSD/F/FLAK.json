    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to dense till (paralithic contact ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The solum and C horizon typically have 2 to 20 percent rock fragments.  The higher content of rock fragments commonly is in the lower part of the solum.  The argillic horizon has 8 to 18 percent clay, 20 to 40 percent medium sand and coarser, and 10 to 20 percent fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3 with a dry value of 6 or more.  The A horizons are sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  The A horizon in forested areas is 2 to 5 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam but includes subhorizons of loamy sand.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam.  Bulk density ranges from 1.45 to 1.80 gm/cc.   It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is sandy loam.  Mottles are not in all pedons.  Bulk density ranges from 1.75 to 1.90 gm/cc.  It is strongly acid to neutral.  This horizon is somewhat restrictive to root penetration due to the platy structure, which is a property of the dense till, but is not as restrictive as the Cd horizon.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  It has mottles in some pedons.   Bulk density ranges from 1.80 to 2.0 gm/cc.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  It is considered to be a paralithic contact."

Balmlake, Bergkeller, Heyder, Nadeau, Oconto, Omena, Sanburn, and Sugarbush soils do not have a paralithic contact, bulk density greater than 1.8 gm/cc, below the argillic horizon.  In addition, Bergkeller, Heyder, Sanburn and Sugarbush soils have 60 percent or more fine sand or coarser in the argillic horizon. Cunard, Milaca, and Oconto soils have hue of 5YR in the argillic horizon.  In addition, Cunard has bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and Milaca has 20 to 30 percent fine sands in the control section.  Emmet soils have carbonates within 50 inches of the surface.  In addition, Emmet and Omena soils have reaction of neutral or higher in the argillic horizon.  Nadeau has greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

Flak soils formed in noncalcareous dense loamy glacial till of Late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual temperature is about 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 24 to 33 inches.  Frost-free days are about 90 to 150.  Elevation above sea level is about 670 to 1450 feet."

The moderately well drained Brainerd soils and poorly drained Nokay soils are on lower lying or less sloping terrain.  The poorly and very poorly drained Parent soils are on nearby flats and the base of slopes. The very poorly drained Prebish soils are in depressions.  The moderately well drained Wabedo soils are on the lower, less sloping landscapes."
