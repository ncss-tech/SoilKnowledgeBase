  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The particle size control section commonly is sandy loam and fine sandy loam, and includes strata of coarse sand, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly, extremely gravelly loamy sand or sand.  It ranges from 6 to 18 percent clay and averages 5 to 20 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent channers and cobbles.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.\nFlatnose soils are dry in some or all parts of the moisture control section during May and June, and continuously moist in some part during July, August and September.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 6.  This horizon is noncalcareous or slightly calcareous.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent channers and cobbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  It is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous and mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

The Neto and Trembles soils have frigid temperature regimes.  The Munjor soils are not dry in some part of the moisture control section for 15 consecutive days in May or June and are moist in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Peralta (T) soils are moist in the moisture control section during May and June and have mottles at 12 to 18 inches.  Pietown soils have an average annual soil temperature of 49 to 56 degrees."
