  "OVERVIEW": "The Fielding series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, and quartzite.  Fielding soils are on lake terraces and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry less than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. in all parts of the moisture control section.  They are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days in all parts of the moisture control section.  Depth to the water table is 45 to 60 inches.\nThe mollic epipedon is 8 to 18 inches thick. The combined thickness of the Ap and Bw is 14 to 32 inches thick and is underlain by a calcic horizon. The control section averages silt loam with about 20 to 24 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizons has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is slightly to strongly calcareous and neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  The dry color changes from light gray or very pale brown to pale brown or light grayish brown.  This horizon has faint mottles below 24 to 30 inches, in some pedons.  Distinct mottles occur below 30 to 40 inches.\nThe Bk and C horizons contain 25 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."
