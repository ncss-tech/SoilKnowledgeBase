  "OVERVIEW": "The Fryingpan series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from densely welded rhyolitic tuff.  They are on structural benches.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
