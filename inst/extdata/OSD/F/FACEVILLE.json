  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is 65 inches or more.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.  In some pedons, the reaction is moderately acid in the BA horizon and upper Bt horizon.  The clay content of the control section ranges from 36 to 55 percent with less than 30 percent silt. Plinthite content ranges from 0 to 4 percent, by volume, below a depth of 40 inches. Ironstone nodules 3 to 20 mm in size in the A, E and BA horizons range from none to up to 11 percent, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has a hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 through 8.  Where the value is 3 or less, it is less than 7 inches thick. Eroded phases have hue as red as 2.5YR and texture of sandy clay loam.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons have a thin Bt horizon with sandy clay loam texture below the A or Ap horizon. Texture is sandy clay, clay loam or clay.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Mottles in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common.  In some pedons, below a depth of 60 inches, there is no dominant color and it is variegated in shades of red, brown and yellow.  Some pedons have redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red and gray below a depth of 60 inches that may be contemporary or relict.  Texture is sandy clay, clay loam or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is below 60 inches and has the same range of colors as the lower Bt horizon.  Texture is sandy clay or sandy clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Esto and Turbeville series in the same family and the Dewey, Fullerton, Henderson, Lugoff, Marlboro, Summerton and Waynesboro series which are Typic Paleudults.  All of these soils are well drained.  Esto soils are on higher knolls and crests of narrow ridges and have variegated reticulate colors in shades of red yellow brown and gray in the upper Bt horizon that are inherited from the parent material.  Turbeville soils are on high terrace positions in the Southern Piedmont (MLRA 136).  Dewey soils formed in residuum that weathered from limestone and are in MLRAs 122 (Highland Ridge and Pennroyal) and 128 (Southern Appalachian Ridges).  Fullerton soils are in MLRA 128.  Henderson soils are on similar positions, formed in residuum that weathered from impure limestone, and have 15 to 35 percent chert fragments throughout their profile.  Ludoff soils have yellower subsoils. Marlboro soils are on similar positions but have yellower subsoils. Summerton soils are on old stream terraces and have redoximorphic concentrations in shades of yellow and brown in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Waynesboro soils formed in alluvium or unconsolidated material of sandstone, shale, and limestone origin.  Slopes are in MLRAs 122 and 128."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Faceville soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain.  They formed in red clayey marine sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent, but are dominantly 0 to 12 percent.  Elevation ranges from 200 to 450 feet.  The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the average annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 50 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Esto, Henderson and Summerton series these include the Clarendon, Dothan, Grady, Greenville, Irvington, Lucy, Malbis, Noboco, Norfolk, Orangeburg, Red Bay, and Tifton series.  Clarendon, Dothan, Irvington, Malbis and Tifton soils are on similar positions and have more than 5 percent plinthite in the control section. In addition, Clarendon, Irvington and Malbis soils are moderately well drained. Dothan, Malbis and Tifton have fine-loamy control sections and Irvington soils have a fragipan. The poorly drained Grady soils are in lower adjacent shallow depressions.  Greenville and Red Bay soils are on similar positions but have Rhodic horizons.  In addition, Red Bay soils are fine-loamy. Lucy soils are on similar to higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick.  Noboco, Norfolk and Orangeburg soils are on similar positions and have fine-loamy control sections. In addition, Noboco and Norfolk soils have yellower subsoils and Noboco soils are moderately well or well drained."

In recent years, some areas have been converted to pasture or reforested.  Dominant trees include loblolly, shortleaf, and slash pine and a mixture of upland oaks, hickory, and dogwood."
