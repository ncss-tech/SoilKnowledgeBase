  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to 80 inches or more.  Volume of gravel typically ranges from 3 to 15 percent throughout but ranges up to 35 percent in individual subhorizons in some pedons.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe Ap has value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap or A is loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is sandy loam or loam.\nFlambeau soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both.) The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR;  value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. It has texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Typically, it is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam but in some pedons it is clay loam or sandy clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Flambeau soils are on ground moraines.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in loamy glacial till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1950 feet."

The moderately well drained Humbird soils are in similar or slightly lower landscape positions adjacent to Flambeau soils in areas of dissected moraines.  The somewhat poorly drained Fallcreek soils form a drainage sequence with Flambeau soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Merrillan soils are in lower landscape positions in areas of dissectd moraines."

Flambeau soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period November to May in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of this soil is cleared and used for cropland.   Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay.  Some areas are used for pastureland.  Some areas are in woodland. Native vegetation is deciduous forest.  Common trees are white ash, sugar maple, northern red oak, American basswood, and northern pin oak."
