  "OVERVIEW": "The Flambeau series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glacial till on ground moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to 80 inches or more.  Volume of gravel typically ranges from 3 to 15 percent throughout but ranges up to 35 percent in individual subhorizons in some pedons.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizon.\nThe Ap has value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap or A is loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is sandy loam or loam.\nFlambeau soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both.) The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR;  value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6. It has texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Typically, it is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam but in some pedons it is clay loam or sandy clay loam."
