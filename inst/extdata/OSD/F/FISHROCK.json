  "OVERVIEW": "The Fishrock series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in material weathered from sandstone or mudstone.  Fishrock soils are on ridgetops and upper side slopes of coastal hills and mountains and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Argillic horizon - 2 to 12 inches (Bt1, Bt2)\n3.  Particle-size control section - 0 to 12 inches weighted average = 40 percent clay\n4.  Soil moisture/temperature - xeric/mesic moisture control section is moist in all parts 210 days and is dry in all parts 90 days in most years.\n5.  Mineralogy - assume to be mixed but strongly influenced by kaolinite.\n6.  Many areas of Fishrock soil were mapped as the Noyo soil by the California Soil Vegetation Survey 1947-1950."
