  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 27 inches.  Free carbonates at the surface are common where soils have been influenced by recharge, but these soils may be leached free of carbonates through the argillic horizon.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  Rock fragments of the entire soil to 60 inches ranges from 0 to 15 percent rounded pebbles.  EC to a depth of 60 inches ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  The BA or AB horizon has the same morphological properties as defined for color and reaction.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture averages loam but clay loams are common when clay size carbonates are present.  Noncarbonate clay ranges from 18 to 30 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 14 percent.  This horizon is not a diagnostic calcic horizon.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blancot, Doak, Fruita, Griffy, Nack, Mesa, Nannyton, Neiber, Papoose, Redlands, and Saddle series.  The Blancot and Doak soils have mean annual soil temperature of 53 to 57 and 52 to 56 degrees F., respectively, and occur in areas where the frost-free season exceeds 140 days.  The Fruita soils are very similar but have mean annual soil temperatures of 51 to 58 degrees F. and occur in areas where the frost-free season is 130 to 190 days.  Griffy and Saddle soils have more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle size control section.  Nack, Mesa, and Nannyton soils have diagnostic calcic horizons.  In addition, Mesa soils are loamy-skeletal at 20 to 40 inches, and Nannyton soils have E horizons and skeletal substratum at 40 to 60 inches.  Neiber and Papoose soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Redland soils have hue of 2.5YR and 5YR in the Bt and substrata."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frisite soils are on relic terraces, fan aprons, valley fill and hill backslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium weathered from preliminary shale and interbedded sandstone but modified by national from mixed sources.  Slopes are simple and range from 0 to 10 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 6,300 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold dry winters and cool moist springs and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches of which about half falls as snow and rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 110 to 130 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
