  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Floridana soils are in depressional areas, flood plains, drainageways, and on low broad flats in the Lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  They formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  The average annual temperature ranges from 72 to 76 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

Anclote and Astor soils have mollic epipedons over sandy C horizons.  Boca, Bradenton, Felda, Holopaw, Malabar, Pineda, Pompano, Riviera, and Winder soils do not have mollic epipedons. Chobee soils have sandy clay loam Bt horizons within depths of 20 inches.  Copeland soils have limestone within 40 inches.  Delray soils have Bt horizons between depths of 40 to 60 inches.  EauGallie, Immokalee, Myakka, and Oldsmar soils have spodic horizons.  Gentry soils do not have E horizons.  Manatee soils have sandy loam Bt horizons at depths of less than 20 inches."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas of Floridana soils have been cleared and used for pasture.  Where water control is adequate, it is used for growing truck crops and citrus.  Natural vegetation consists of sand cordgrass, cabbage palmetto, myrtle, and pineland threeawn.  In depressional areas, most of the soil has a sparse to dense cover of cypress.  In flood plains, the vegetation is mostly sweetgum, blackgum, red maple, and cypress."
