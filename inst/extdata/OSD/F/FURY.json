  "OVERVIEW": "The Fury series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. They are in lake basins, floodplains, floodplain steps, and along drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist and are saturated for 2 months or more unless artificially drained. The 10- to 40-inch control section is dominantly silty clay loam with thin layers of silt loam it has a weighted average of 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand. The profile is noncalcareous, except that the surface 1 to 5 inches in some pedons is slightly calcareous. The mollic epipedon is 24 to 60 inches thick and has 1 to 8 percent organic matter It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons range to moderately alkaline in the upper of the A horizon.  Depth to seasonal high water table ranges from +6 to 20 inches, January through June.  Depth to redoximorphic features ranges from the lower part of the A horizon to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 dry, 1 to 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Chroma of 2 only occurs in the lower part of the mollic epipedon. It is silt loam, but some pedons have a 1 to 3 inch thick mucky surface. Structure is granular, platy or subangular blocky in the upper part and prismatic, subangular or granular in the lower part. The lower part has distinct or prominent redox iron accumulations.\nBelow a depth of 24 inches buried soils and deposits of volcanic ash layers can be present. When present, buried A horizons have color and texture similar to the surface A horizons. Volcanic ash layer have silt loam texture with hue of 10YR value of 7 or 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 1 dry."
