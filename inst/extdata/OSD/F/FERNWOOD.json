The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F.  The solum is estimated to have acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and less than 2.0 cmol per kg fine earth of 1N KCL extractable aluminum.  It has 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  It is strongly acid to moderately acid.  Moist bulk density is 0.85 to 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter throughout.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or silt loam.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 35 percent gravel and 5 to 25 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 25 percent gravel and 25 to 50 percent cobbles."
