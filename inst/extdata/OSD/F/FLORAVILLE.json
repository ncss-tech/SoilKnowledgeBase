The moderately well drained Redbud soils are on more sloping parts of the lacustrine terrace.  The Lakaskia soils form a biosequence with the Floraville soils, and the Redbud and Millstadt soils form a hydrosequence with the Floraville soils.  The very poorly drained Wabash soils have a mollic epipedon and are in drainageways on the lacustrine terrace."
