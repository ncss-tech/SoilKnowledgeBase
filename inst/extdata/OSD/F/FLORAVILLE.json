  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Floraville soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional parts of broad treads on loess-covered lacustrine terraces.   Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in 36 inches to 70 inches of loess (Peoria Silt), and the underlying lacustrine sediments (Equality Formation).  In some pedons the loess and the lacustrine sediments are interbedded.  In some pedons, the underlying Roxana Silt is within the series control section.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 40 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation is 340 to 430 feet above sea level."

Also, Bartelso soils have a mollic epipedon.  The poorly drained Lakaskia soils have a mollic epipedon and are on similar landform positions as the Floraville soils.  The moderately well drained Redbud soils are on more sloping parts of the lacustrine terrace.  The Lakaskia soils form a biosequence with the Floraville soils, and the Redbud and Millstadt soils form a hydrosequence with the Floraville soils.  The very poorly drained Wabash soils have a mollic epipedon and are in drainageways on the lacustrine terrace."
