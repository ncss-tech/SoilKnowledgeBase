These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone, tuffs and sandstone with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,865 to 2,045 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm; mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
