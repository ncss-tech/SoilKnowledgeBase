  "OVERVIEW": "The Fenelon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone, tuffs and sandstone with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The Fenelon soils are on side slopes of hills.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
