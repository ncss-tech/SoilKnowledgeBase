  "OVERVIEW": "The Fears series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice mixed with colluvium from granitic rocks. Fears soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 30 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
