  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fishsnooze soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on planar to convex-shaped backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, tuff, or tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 12,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid- continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 15 to 60 days."

The isotic mineralogy class is based on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH and on laboratory data for the associated Florand and Lostridge soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
