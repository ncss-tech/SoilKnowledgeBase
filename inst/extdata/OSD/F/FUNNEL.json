  "OVERVIEW": "The Funnel series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium over sand and gravel derived from mixed sources.  These soils occur on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
