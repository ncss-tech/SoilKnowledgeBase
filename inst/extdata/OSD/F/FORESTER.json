  "OVERVIEW": "The Forester series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and mixed alluvium. Forester soils are on low terraces and have slopes 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually dry but are saturated with water during the winter unless artificially drained. The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The soils are moderately or strongly calcareous, strongly or very strongly alkaline, with moderate to high amounts of soluble salts and exchangeable sodium percentage over 15 percent. The thickness of the ash or depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The content of ash and/or pumice in the ash overlay is commonly more than 60 percent in one or more horizons and ranges from 20 to more than 60 percent in the others.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist. It has weak thin platy, granular, or weak fine subangular blocky structure or is single grained.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam. The AC horizon is similar to the A horizon but lacks the platy structure and the sandy loam texture.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. The nodules are lacking in some pedons.\nthe 2C3 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist. It is stratified fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam and silty loam."

Shanahan soils are well drained, noncalcareous, slightly acid or neutral and have cryic soil temperature.  Umapine soils are coarse, silty throughout and have less than 60 percent ash in any part."

The climate is semiarid with an average annual precipitation of 9 to 14 inches. Summers are warm and dry with an average temperature of 61 to 63 degrees F. Winters are cool and moist with an average temperature of 32 to 34 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost free period is 100 to 130 days."
