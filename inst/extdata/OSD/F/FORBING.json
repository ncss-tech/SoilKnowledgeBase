  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  The A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/1), or brown (10YR 4/3; 7.5YR 4/4).  It is\nsilt loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a thin brownish A2 horizon.  The A horizon ranges from slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe B2t horizon is yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 4/6), reddish brown\n(5YR 4/4), red (2.5YR 4/6), or dark red (2.5YR 3/6).  In some\npedons the B2t horizon has few or common brownish mottles.  Clay content of the Bt horizon ranges from 60 to 80 percent.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral in the upper part and\nneutral through moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Calcium carbonate concretions that are 2 to 20 mm in diameter make up 1 to\n5 percent of the lower Bt horizon in some pedons.\nThe B3 horizon is reddish brown (5YR 4/4), yellowish red (5YR\n4/6), red (2.5YR 4/6), or dark red (2.5YR 3/6), with grayish\nmottles.  It is clay or silty clay.  This horizon is mildly\nalkaline or moderately alkaline and has up to 5 percent calcium carbonate concretions in some pedons."

Annona and Bryarly soils have less than 60 percent clay\nand gray mottles in the B2t horizon.  Boswell and Millwood soils\nare acid throughout the solum and lack free calcium carbonate.  Counts, Stigler, and Tamaha soils have gray mottles within 30\ninches of the surface.  Gore soils have grayish subhorizons.\nMcKamie soils have mixed mineralogy and a decrease in clay within\n60 inches of the surface.  Morse soils are calcareous throughout.  Woodtell soils have gray mottles and a decrease in clay within 60 inches."

Forbing\nsoils formed in red clayey alluvium most likely eroded from\nPermian Red Beds.  Climate is warm and humid, mean annual precipitaton is 48 inches, and mean annual temperature is 64\ndegrees F. at the type location."
