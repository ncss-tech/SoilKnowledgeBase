  "OVERVIEW": "The Forbing series consists of deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils.  They formed in thick clayey sediments on alluvial terraces of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep plains.  Water runs off the surface at\na medium to rapid rate.  Slope is dominantly 1 to 8 percent but ranges up to 20 percent along drainageways.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  The A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/1), or brown (10YR 4/3; 7.5YR 4/4).  It is\nsilt loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a thin brownish A2 horizon.  The A horizon ranges from slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe B2t horizon is yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 4/6), reddish brown\n(5YR 4/4), red (2.5YR 4/6), or dark red (2.5YR 3/6).  In some\npedons the B2t horizon has few or common brownish mottles.  Clay content of the Bt horizon ranges from 60 to 80 percent.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral in the upper part and\nneutral through moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Calcium carbonate concretions that are 2 to 20 mm in diameter make up 1 to\n5 percent of the lower Bt horizon in some pedons.\nThe B3 horizon is reddish brown (5YR 4/4), yellowish red (5YR\n4/6), red (2.5YR 4/6), or dark red (2.5YR 3/6), with grayish\nmottles.  It is clay or silty clay.  This horizon is mildly\nalkaline or moderately alkaline and has up to 5 percent calcium carbonate concretions in some pedons."
