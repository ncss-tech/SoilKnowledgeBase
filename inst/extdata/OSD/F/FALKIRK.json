  "OVERVIEW": "The Falkirk series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial sediments underlain by glacial till on uplands.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
