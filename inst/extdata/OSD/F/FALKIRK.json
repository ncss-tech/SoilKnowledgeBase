The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 inches to more than 30 inches in thickness and extends into the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam averaging between 18 and 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand. It has weak or moderate prismatic structure parting to weak or moderate blocky structure.\nThe 2C horizon commonly is gravelly loam but in some pedons contains a few cobbles and stones or is sandy and less than 6 inches thick.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The 3C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam glacial till containing carbonates and 2 to 10 percent by volume of rock fragments.  It has accumulations of carbonates in the upper part in some pedons."

Arnegard and Garlips soils do not have gravelly loam 2C horizons or glacial till within depths of 40 inches.  Roseglen soils are silt loam throughout, have formed in lacustrine sediments, and do not have glacial till within depths of 40 inches.  Bowery, Shawa and Sheckle soils do not have carbonates within depths of 40 inches.  In addition, Sheckle soils do not have cambic horizons. Lonecone and Yeoman soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Obrien soils do not have a discontinuity."

The soils formed in glaciofluvial sediments 20 to 40 inches thick overlying glacial till.  The climate is semiarid.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer."

Arnegard soils are in nearby concave swales.  Roseglen soils are on nearby lake plains.  Bowbells soils are on nearby glacial till uplands.  Bowbells and Flaxton soils have argillic horizons. Flaxton soils are on nearby sand-mantled till plains.  Bowdle soils are on nearby outwash terraces.  Bowdle soils have sand and gravel at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Parshall soils are on stream terraces and outwash where sandy deposits are over 40 inches thick.  Parshall soils are coarse-loamy.  Max and Williams soils are on nearby glacial till uplands.  Both have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches in thickness."
