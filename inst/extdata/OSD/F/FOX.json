  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fox soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, valley trains, and kames and in outwash areas on moraines. Slope gradients range from 0 to 35 percent. These soils formed in thin loess and loamy alluvium or just in loamy alluvium overlying stratified calcareous sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1120 mm (27 to 44 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 13.9 degrees C (46 to 57 degrees F). The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 190 days. Elevation ranges from 177 to 396 meters (580 to 1300 feet)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Near the type location, these are the Casco, Dresden, Matherton, Ockley, and Sebewa soils. The somewhat excessively drained Casco soils are on landscape positions similar to those of Fox soils where the loamy mantle is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick over outwash. The well drained Dresden and Ockley soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Fox soils. Dresden soils are in areas where the surface layer is dark colored. Ockley soils are in areas where the loamy soil is more than 102 cm (40 inches) thick over outwash. The somewhat poorly drained Matherton soils and the poorly drained Sebewa soils form a drainage sequence with Fox soils."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometer per second) in the silty and loamy mantle and high to very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the sand and gravelly outwash. Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sand and gravel outwash."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the less sloping areas are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland or woodland. Native vegetation is hardwood forest. Common trees are northern red oak, white oak, sugar maple, black cherry, and white ash."
