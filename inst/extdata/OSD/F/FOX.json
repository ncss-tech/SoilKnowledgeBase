  "OVERVIEW": "The Fox series consists of very deep, well drained soils which are moderately deep to stratified calcareous sandy outwash. These soils formed in thin loess and in loamy alluvium or just in loamy alluvium overlying stratified calcareous sandy outwash on outwash plains, stream terraces, valley trains, kames, and glacial moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches) near the type location. Mean annual air temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 F).",

The somewhat excessively drained Casco soils are on landscape positions similar to those of Fox soils where the loamy mantle is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick over outwash. The well drained Dresden and Ockley soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Fox soils. Dresden soils are in areas where the surface layer is dark colored. Ockley soils are in areas where the loamy soil is more than 102 cm (40 inches) thick over outwash. The somewhat poorly drained Matherton soils and the poorly drained Sebewa soils form a drainage sequence with Fox soils."
