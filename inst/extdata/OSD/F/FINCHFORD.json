  "STATES": "IA,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Finchford series consist of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in coarse textured alluvium or glacial outwash. Finchford soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys and valley trains on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 14 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 870 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
