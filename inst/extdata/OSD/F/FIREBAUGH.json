These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess or silty sediment and the underlying loamy and clayey material weathered from cherty dolostone.  Mean annual temperature is about 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 38 to 48 inches."

These soils have a perched high water table from 1.5 to 2.5 feet from the soil surface between December and April in most years.  This saturated zone is typically a few inches thick and is present for a few days or more after heavy rainfall or snowmelt."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches (A and E horizons);\n2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 7 to 70 inches (Bt and 2Btx and 3Bt horizons);\n3) Fragic properties - 20 to 35 inches (2Btx horizon);\n4) Ultisol feature - The typical pedon has a base saturation of 37 percent at the critical depth. This is within the margin of sampling or lab error for placement into the Ultisol order.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Missouri University soil characterization laboratory number M9412334.  The 3Bt horizon was split for sampling purposes.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
