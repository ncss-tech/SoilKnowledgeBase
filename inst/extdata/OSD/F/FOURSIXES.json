  "OVERVIEW": "The Foursixes series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in materials weathered from dolomitic limestone.  These nearly level soils are on flat mesas and benches of uplands in Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78B).  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and an abrupt depth to hard bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  A thin coating of precipitated calcium-magnesium carbonate is on the bedrock.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Clay films are 1 chroma darker than soil matrix.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and is noneffervescent to slightly effervescent.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma 4 to 6.  Texture is clay or clay loam.  Clay films are 1 chroma darker than soil matrix.  Reaction is mostly strongly effervescent and moderately alkaline, but a few pedons are noneffervescent and slightly alkaline.  Concretions and masses of calcium carbonate make up as much as 5 percent by volume in most pedons.  Fragments of weathered dolomitic limestone mainly less than 3 inches across long axis comprise as much as 5 percent of the volume of some horizons.\nThe R layer is indurated and coarsely fractured dolomitic limestone about 1 to 3 or more feet thick.  The surface of the limestone is weathered and commonly is capped with a  coating of precipitated calcium-magnesium carbonate less than 1 cm thick.  Some fractures are sealed by the calcium-magnesium carbonate.\nThe Cd1 and Cd2 layers are stratified weakly consolidated shales.  The first shale bed below the dolomitic limestone is grayish.  The next lower shale bed has reddish colors.  The shales are moderately alkaline and strongly effervescent."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acove, Bluegrove, Callahan, Katemcy, and Lindale series in the same family and the similar Bexar, Bronte, Lindy, Rowden, Scullin, and Swenson series.  Acove soils have stony argillic horizons over weakly consolidated sandstone.  Bluegrove soils are underlain by weathered sandstone.  Callahan soils are underlain by shaly clays.  Katemcy soils are underlain by schist.  Bexar, Rowden, Scullin, and Swenson soils have mollic epipedons.  Bronte soils have sola more than 40 inches thick and are underlain by loamy material.  Lindale soils are underlain by gravelly clay.  Lindy soils lack argillic horizons with accumulations of calcium carbonate and occur in areas of higher rainfall."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Foursixes soils are on upland limestone ridges and mesas. The underlying Permian dolomitic limestone is generally of the Blaine Formation of Permian age.  Slope gradients are 0 to 1 percent.  The climate in the area of occurrence is dry subhumid with a mean annual precipitation range of 22 to 24 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  Frost-free season ranges from 210 to 230 days and elevation ranges from 1600 to 1850 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 34 to 38."

Knoco, Tilvern, Vernon and Westill soils are underlain by reddish clays and shale with clay texture.  Talpa soils have loamy control sections and are underlain by limestone at depths of less than 20 inches."
