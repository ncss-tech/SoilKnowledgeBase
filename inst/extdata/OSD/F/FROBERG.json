  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the clayey sediments ranges from about 15 to 36 inches. The solum ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part; some pedons contain free carbonates. The 2C horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. Gravel and cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the 2C horizon.\nSome pedon have Oe and/or Oa horizons composed of partially decomposed or well decomposed forest litter.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or clay.  Where present, the A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3, or is neutral with value of 2 to 4. Where present, the E horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The A and E horizons are silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B part of the B\\E horizon have chroma of 3 to 6. They are silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. The E part has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have chroma of 3 to 6. They are silty clay or clay. Clay content in the Bt or BC horizons ranges from 40 to 80 percent. The 2Bt or 2BC horizons has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 or 6. It ranges from sandy loam to sandy clay loam. Some pedons do not have a BC horizon.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon.  The 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10R, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 5. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar or related soils include Dighton, Hibbing, Sent, Nester, Nunica, Ontonagon, and Watton. Dighton soils have coarser textured upper sola. Hibbing, Kent, Nester, and Watton soils formed in glacial till, have a coarser textured upper sola, and do not have sandy loam in the lower part of the solum. Nunica soils formed in coarser textured lacustrine sediments and have a coarser textured solum. Ontonagon soils are very-fine and do not have sandy loam or sandy clay loam 2C horizons."

Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. Annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 67 degrees F."
