  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Froberg series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in clayey material overlying loamy material on lake plains. Permeability is very slow in the clayey material and moderate or moderately slow in the loamy material. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The solum ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part; some pedons contain free carbonates. The 2C horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid. Gravel and cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the 2C horizon.\nSome pedon have Oe and/or Oa horizons composed of partially decomposed or well decomposed forest litter.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or clay.  Where present, the A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3, or is neutral with value of 2 to 4. Where present, the E horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. The A and E horizons are silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B part of the B\\E horizon have chroma of 3 to 6. They are silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. The E part has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have chroma of 3 to 6. They are silty clay or clay. Clay content in the Bt or BC horizons ranges from 40 to 80 percent. The 2Bt or 2BC horizons has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 or 6.
