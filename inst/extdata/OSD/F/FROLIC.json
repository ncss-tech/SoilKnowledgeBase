  "OVERVIEW": "The Frolic series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed family of Cumulic Haploborolls. Typically, Frolic soils have a dark grayish brown very fine sandy loam a horizon, a dark grayish brown loam and sandy clay loam B horizon, and a brown fine sandy loam C1 horizon.",

A water table is at depths of 3 to 5 feet. There are thin discontinuous lenses and pockets of sand and gravel. The A1 horizon has dry value of 3 or 4, moist value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very fine sandy loam or loam.  The B2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam or sandy clay loam and has 20 to 30 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Frolic soils are in swales and fans at elevations of 8,000 to 10,500 feet. Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. The soils formed in medium to moderately coarse textured alluvium derived from acid igneous and sedimentary rocks. The climate is continental with a mean annual temperature of 40 degrees to 45 degrees F.; mean summer temperature of 57 degrees to 61 degrees F. Annual precipitation is 16 to 19 inches with more than half falling during the frost-free season. The growing season is less than 90 days."
