  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Frolic soils are in swales and fans at elevations of 8,000 to 10,500 feet. Slopes are 1 to 5 percent. The soils formed in medium to moderately coarse textured alluvium derived from acid igneous and sedimentary rocks. The climate is continental with a mean annual temperature of 40 degrees to 45 degrees F.; mean summer temperature of 57 degrees to 61 degrees F. Annual precipitation is 16 to 19 inches with more than half falling during the frost-free season. The growing season is less than 90 days."
