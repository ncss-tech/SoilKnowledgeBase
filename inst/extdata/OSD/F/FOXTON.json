  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock typically are about 26 inches but range from 20 to 40 inches.  Some pedons have thin, dark colored A horizons with 1 to 4 percent organic matter.  Average cation exchange capacity to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 60 to 100 millequivalents per 100 grams of soil.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 44 degrees F.  Rock fragment content ranges from none in the upper part of the solum to a maximum of 35 percent in the lower part of the solum directly above the lithic contact.  The soils are typically noncalcareous throughout but may be slightly effervescent near the coarse fragments immediately above the bedrock.\nThe A horizon, if present, is thin, less than three inches thick, and has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is commonly loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam and less commonly silt loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent and are 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is commonly clay in the upper part and cobbly clay in the lower part and less commonly silty clay loam or clay loam which may be modified with coarse fragments.  The Bt horizon is 35 to 50 percent clay and contains less than 40 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments are gravel or cobbles and range from 5 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has the same color range as the Bt horizon.  It is cobbly clay loam or cobbly silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe lithic contact is commonly composed of Amsden limestone but because of interbedding is less commonly hard sandstone or shale."

The soils formed in fine textured alluvium or residuum of weathered limestone interbedded with thin lenses of sandstone and shale.  The mean annual temperature varies from 34 to 38 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 20 to 36 inches.  Elevations range from 6,500 to over 9,000 feet."
