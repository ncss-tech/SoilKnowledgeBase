These soils are dry for 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. They are usually dry in the moisture control section for 55 to 70 days during the 120 days following June 21.  The soil moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nThe mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle size control section averages less than 18 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent gravel.  Organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly loam or very gravelly loam, It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.

Decathon soils have an indurated silica hardpan between a depth of 20 to 40 inches, and are fine-loamy in the particle size control section. Both the Wieland and Buster soils have strongly cemented silica layers between a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Wieland soils are fine textured in the particle size control section.  Buster soils are fine-loamy in the particle size control section."
