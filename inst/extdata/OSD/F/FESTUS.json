  "OVERVIEW": "The Festus series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium from mixed igneous rocks. These soils are in drainageways on fan remnants and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",
