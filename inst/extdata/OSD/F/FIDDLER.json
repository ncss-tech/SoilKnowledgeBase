  "OVERVIEW": "The Fiddler series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Fiddler soils are on hills, plateaus, and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
