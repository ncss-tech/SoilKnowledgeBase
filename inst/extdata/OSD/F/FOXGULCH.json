  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Foxgulch series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on floodplains, drainageways, swales and outwash plains.  These soils are subject to prolonged saturation due to flood irrigation.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
