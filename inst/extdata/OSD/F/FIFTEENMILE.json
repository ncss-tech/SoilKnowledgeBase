These soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff with minor components of limestone and quartzite. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Elevations range from 1,600 to 2,000 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
