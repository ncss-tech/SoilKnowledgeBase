  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fifteenmile series consist of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine deposits with minor amounts of limestone and quartzite.  Fifteenmile soils are on stream terraces, drainageways, and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
