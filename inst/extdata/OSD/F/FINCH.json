  "STATES": "ME,MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Finch series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy glacial outwash, sandy lacustrine deposits or sandy glacial till with a strongly cemented subsoil.  These soils are on outwash plains, lake plains and ground moraines. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the ortstein and rapid in the rest of the pedon.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",
