    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Cobbly surface phases have 15 to 35 percent cobbles in the A horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, 5YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon that has 10YR hue, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. The A or Ap horizons are sand or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sand or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral.\nThe Bhsm horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Cementation ranges from weak to strong. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bsm horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Hues with value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.  Some pedons have Bs horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 8.

The Au Gres soils do not have ortstein and are on similar topographic positions.  The somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska and Rubicon soils and the well drained Wallace soils are on higher topographic positions in nearby landscapes.  The moderately well drained Paquin and Croswell soils are on slightly higher landscape positions.
