  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic matter content of the surface 7 inches is 1 or 2 percent.  The depth to the base of the cambic horizon is 11 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 12 percent clay with less than 50 percent very fine sand and contains 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments.  The reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.  A fluctuating water table between 0 and 24 inches occurs during the growing season due to irrigation.  The soil is dry in all parts more than half the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 5 degrees C. (41 F.) and never moist in some or all parts for as long as 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 8 degrees C. (47 F.).  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is less than 8 degrees C. (47 F.), and the mean annual summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is greater than 15 degrees C. (59 F.).  The mean annual winter and summer soil temperatures differ by more than 5 degrees C.  (9 F.)\nThe A horizon has value 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Coarse fragments range from 20 to 40 percent pebbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Texture is gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 30 to 45 percent pebbles.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 through 5 dry and moist.  Texture of the matrix is loamy sand or sand modified by 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments, most of which are pebbles."
