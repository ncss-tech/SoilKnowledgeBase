  "OVERVIEW": "The Folavar series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on flood plains and stream terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent with mounded micro-relief a common feature.  The mean annual precipitation is about 310 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
