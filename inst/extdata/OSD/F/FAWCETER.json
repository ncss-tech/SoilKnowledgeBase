    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist, and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between the depth of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F. The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is less than 9 degrees F. The depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. The umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick. The particle size control section averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments, 2 to 4 percent acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half iron, and 90 to 100 percent P-retention. Moist bulk density is 0.75 to 0.90 g/cm3. The hue is 10YR or 7.5YR throughout.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry and has chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry. It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry and has chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry. It is medial loam or medial silt loam and has 20 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and has chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 6 dry. It is medial loam or medial silt loam and has 20 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 50 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This draft reflects a change in classification by adding ferrihydritic mineralogy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nUmbric epipedon - from 1 to 41 inches (A1, A2, and Bw1 horizons).\nCambic horizon - from 41 to 57 inches (Bw2 horizon).\nAndic soil properties - from 1 to 57 inches (A1, A2, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - from 1 to 41 inches (A1, A2, and Bw1 horizons).\nMedial-skeletal - Averages 35 percent or more rock fragments in the particle-size control section.\nThe series was established in 2006.  The series was added to the Clatsop County soil survey legend prior to the final correlation for Tillamook County in order to have an exact join with Tillamook County soil survey.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
