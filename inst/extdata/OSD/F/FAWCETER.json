  "OVERVIEW": "The Fawceter series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from volcanic rock. Fawceter soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of mountains. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 115 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Moist bulk density is 0.75 to 0.90 g/cm3. The hue is 10YR or 7.5YR throughout.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry and has chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry. It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry and has chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry.

The series was added to the Clatsop County soil survey legend prior to the final correlation for Tillamook County in order to have an exact join with Tillamook County soil survey."
