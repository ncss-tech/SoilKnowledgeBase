  "OVERVIEW": "The Fredensborg series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable formed in fine textured calcareous sediments overlying marl or soft limestone.  They are on foot slopes and valleys of uplands with slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR hue, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 2 to 4.   Texture ranges from silty clay to clay and structure from weak to moderate granular.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.  It consists of a mixture of materials from the A and underlying soft limestone resulting from worm activity.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is soft marly limestone."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aguilita and Sion series in the same family and the Pozo Blanco and Yauco series.  The Aguilita and Sion soils typically have thinner sola, are lighter textured, and have less plastic A and B horizons that lack pressure faces.  The Pozo Blanco soils have a cambic horizon above a calcic horizon and the Yauco soils are fine-silty."

The regolith is fine texture calcareous sediments overlying marl or soft limestone.  The climate is semiarid. Rainfall ranges from 35 to 40 inches and mean annual temperature is 78 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Hesselberg, Aguilita, Fraternidad and the Coamo series in addition to the Sion. The Hesselberg soils are shallow red soils having thin subsoils with moderate structure and overlying semi-consolidated limestone.  The Aguilita soils are gravelly and very shallow (4 to 14 inches) to soft limestone.  The Fraternidad soils are deep calcareous fine textured soils with many slickensides.  The Coamo soils are deep, have moderately fine textured A horizons, fine textured argillic horizons and calcareous, stratified C horizons."
