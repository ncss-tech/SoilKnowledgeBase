  "OVERVIEW": "The Fendersflat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesitic tuff, volcanic ash and volcanic rocks. Fendersflat soils are on backslopes of mountains. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
