  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fivepine series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in reworked eolian deposits, or clayey slope alluvium over residuum, derived from sandstone. Fivepine soils are on mesas and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
