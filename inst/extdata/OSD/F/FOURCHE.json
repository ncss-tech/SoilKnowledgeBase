  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fourche series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in loess and the underlying residuum from dolomite or limestone.  These soils are on upland side slopes and point ridges.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock are about 60 to more than 100 inches.  The upper solum formed in 18 to 36 inches of loess.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam except for eroded areas which are silty clay loam.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe AB (where present) and Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nIn the 2Bt/E horizon, the 2Bt portion has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Some pedons are mottled with gray colors.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The E portion is discontinuous silt loam material that makes up 5 to 20 percent of the horizon and are 1 to 5 mm thick on surfaces of peds.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  This horizon is very strongly acid to medium acid.  Common to many masses and concretions of iron and manganese accumulations may be present.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8, and commonly has mottles with lower chroma.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon."

Slope gradients commonly are 5 to 9 percent but range from 2 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in loess and the underlying residuum from dolomite or limestone. The bedrock in some places is glauconitic or interbedded with shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 to 45 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Auxvasse, Caneyville, Crider, Gasconade, and Hildebrecht soils. Auxvasse soils are poorly drained. Caneyville soils are underlain by dolomite between 20 to 40 inches. Crider soils do not have glossic properties and are on similar landscape postions. Gasconade soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and have a mollic epipedon. Hildebrecht soils have a fragipan and commonly are on higher ridgetops. Auxvasse, Caneyville, and Gasconade soils are on lower landscape positions."
