Where not irrigated, the soil is dry in all parts between the depths of 6 and 18 inches from June to October and is moist in all parts from December to May.  It is moist in some part from October to June.  Mean annual soil temperature varies from 59 to 62 degrees F and is less than 47 degrees F for 30 to 60 days in December and January.  Rock fragment content ranges form 0 to 15 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  It has 18 to 30 percent clay.  Base saturation (sum) is 75 to 95 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  It is loam or clay loam with an average of 20 to 30 percent clay.  Below 36 inches, some pedons have very gravelly loam, very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam substrata.
