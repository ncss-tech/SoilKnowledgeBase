  "OVERVIEW": "The Fresno series is a member of the Fine-Loamy, Mixed, Thermic family of Natric Durixeralfs.  Fresno Soils have light gray strongly alkaline A horizons, light brownish gray strongly alkaline sandy clay loam Bt horizons which abruptly overlies strongly cemented lime-silica hardpan.  Salts and alkali are usually present in excessive amounts.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to duripan ranges from 14 to 36 model inches but is typically about 24 inches. The soils are dry for 60 consecutive days or more. Soil mineralogy is mixed.\nThe A horizons range in color (10YR and 2.5Y hues) from grayish brown, light grayish brown, light gray to very pale brown; in texture from sandy loam to loam; in reaction from moderately to very strongly alkaline and usually calcareous; structure is massive but there may be a thin (inch) vesicular or platy crust on the surface. Dark brown irregular and spotty stains, indicative of an alkali condition, commonly occur at the surface and in the soil.\nThe B2t horizons range in color(10YR and 2.5Y hues) from light grayish brown to dark grayish brown with occasional light olive brown to olive brown, in texture from light clay loam, clay loam to sandy clay loam; in reaction from moderately to very strongly alkaline and in structure from moderate to strong angular blocky.\nThe hardpan is variable indegree of hardness but usually is strongly cemented.  It may be platy to massive in structure.  The underlying material is somewhat stratified, friable but with strongly cemented lenses in some areas."

The La Palma soils have yellowish brown A horizons, a light brown Bt horizon with a pH exceeding 9.6 and a white lime cemented Ccam horizon.  The Louie soils have light brownish gray sandy loam A horizons, clay loan to light clay Bt horizons on light gray moderately alkaline strongly cemented Cm horizons.  Dinuba soils have grayish brown, neutral A horizons, light brownish gray mildly alkaline sandy loam Bt horizons and a white stratified silt and very fine sandy loam, weakly cemented Cca horizon. El Peco soils have very pale brown strongly alkaline A sandy loam horizons, similar C horizons overlying strongly cemented lime silica pan. Lewis soils have pale brown A horizons, brown, clay Bt horizons and a brown, weakly lime cemented hardpan, 2-8 inches thick. The Pachappa soils have darker surface horizons and lack duripans within a depth of 40 inches.  Pond soils lack duripans.  Pogo soils have mollic epipedons. Traver soils have argillic horizon with less than 18 percent clay and lack duripans."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Fresno soils occur in nearly level valley plains with an irregular low hummocky microrelief.  The lower part of the profile consists of stratified sediments principally from the granitic Sierra Nevada.  Also soils occur at elevations from near sea level to approximately 250 feet in a semiarid mesothermal climate having a mean annual precipitation of 6 to 12 inches with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters; an average January temperature of 45 degrees f.; an average July temperature of 82 degrees F.; average annual temperature of 63 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is over 250 days."
