  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist, but are dry throughout the control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer months.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The solum ranges in thickness from 45 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 5 to 10 feet.  The solum commonly lacks rock fragments except for a few in the surface horizon.  The solum has a base saturation (sum) of 50 to 75 percent in all parts.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist in the upper 4 inches and 4 in the lower part or AB horizon, dry value closest to 6, and chroma of 1 and 2.  It has moderate medium granular structure in the A horizon and weak or moderate fine or very fine subangular blocky or fine and medium granular structure in the AB horizon.  Combined thickness ranges from 7 to 12 inches.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with parts of the Bt horizon near clay.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 30 to 35 percent clay, commonly near 35 percent.  There is 25 to 30 percent fine sand and coarser but less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  The B horizon has moderate or strong, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon is highly variegated sandy clay loams or loams.  The underlying bedrock is grennish breccia.\nIt is very strongly or strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Fives are on mountainous uplands and footslopes at elevations of 1,500 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in very deep moderately fine textured colluvium or residuum weathered from volcanic breccia bedrock.  The climate is subhumid with dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  Snow and rain come during the winter months.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 30 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 66 degrees F.  The mean annual frost-free season ranges from 100 to 160 days."
