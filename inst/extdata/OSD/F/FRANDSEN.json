The soils are dry in some or all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 110 consecutive days in most years, but are moist in some parts 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F., at a depth of 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.\nThe Bw and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 to 5 moist.  They are loam or clay loam.  Clay content averages from 20 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 to 5 moist.  It is typically loam, but includes fine sandy loam below 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

These soils occur on fan terraces, dissected alluvial fans and mountain footslopes and formed in colluvium and alluvium weathered from sandstone, limestone, and shale.  The climate is dry subhumid, average annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F., and the freeze-free period is 60 to 100 days."

Cooney soils have carbonatic mineralogy and have a fine-silty particle-size control section.  Guben soils have a mollic epipedon and have a calcic horizon.  Luhon soils have a calcic horizon.  Panguitch soils have a mollic epipedon, a cambic horizon and a calcic horizon."
