  "OVERVIEW": "The Frandsen series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed from alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone, limestone and shale.  Frandsen soils are on dissected alluvial fans and mountain footslopes and have slopes of 1 to 50 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",

The soils are dry in some or all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 110 consecutive days in most years, but are moist in some parts 50 to 60 percent of the time the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F., at a depth of 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.\nThe Bw and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 to 5 moist.  They are loam or clay loam.  Clay content averages from 20 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 to 5 moist.  It is typically loam, but includes fine sandy loam below 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
