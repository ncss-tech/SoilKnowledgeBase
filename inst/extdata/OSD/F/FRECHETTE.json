  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to free carbonates range from 45 to 75 inches. The weighted average clay content ranges from 8 to 18 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 35 to 65 percent in the particle-size control section. Rock fragments are a mixture of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary. The sedimentary rocks are mostly dolomite. Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 15 percent throughout the soil and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid to neutral in the lower part. Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nSome pedons have a thin O horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nFrechette soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Typically, it is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam, but thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam are in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Typically, it is sandy loam or fine sandy loam, but in some pedons it is loam."

The well drained Perote soils are on nearby areas where sandy outwash is at 40 to 60 inches. The well drained Rabe soils are on nearby areas where there is a sandy mantle 20 to 40 inches thick over the till."

Timber stands are mostly sugar maple, red maple, northern red oak, American basswood, American beech, and white ash with eastern hophornbeam, paper birch and eastern white pine as associates in most stands. Red pine is an associate in some stands. Some areas are cleared and used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. Some areas are used for pastureland."
