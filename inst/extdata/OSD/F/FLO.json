  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 60 inches thick.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through medium acid throughout the profile.  Base saturation at 72 inches ranges from 35 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Where value is less than 3.5, it is less than 10 inches thick.  The texture of the A and E horizon is typically loamy fine sand, but includes fine sand.  The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Randomly distributed pockets of uncoated sand grains range from few to common.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10YR, value of 5 to 8 and chroma of 3 to 8.  The texture is a loamy fine sand with a clay increase of 3 to 8 percent greater than the overlying E horizon.  The horizon typically contains few to common lamella that have redder or browner colors.\nThe E portion of the E and B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 8 and chroma of 3 through 8.  The B portion (lamellae) has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  The lamellae are loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam.  The composite thickness of individual lamella thicker than 1 cm ranges from 10 to 15 cm within a depth of 2 meters.  The lamella are typically spaced from 2 to 10 inches apart."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bienville and Glenpool series in the same family and the similar Aquilla, Betis, Depcor, Eufaula, Larue, Pickton, Tonkawa and Wolfpen.  Bienville soils have a seasonal water table at a depth of 4 to 6 feet, and are on stream terraces.  Glenpool soils have cooler soil temperatures, have hues 5YR or redder, and have developed in Quarternary terrace deposits.  Aquilla and Eufaula soils are drier for longer periods of time in the moisture control section.  Betis soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Depcor, Larue, and Wolfpen soils have sandy A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick overlying fine-loamy Bt horizons.  Pickton soils have sandy A horizons more than 40 inches thick overlying fine-loamy Bt horizons.  Tonkawa soils are sandy throughout and lack argillic horizons."

Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent but are mainly 2 to 5 percent.  The soil formed in thick beds of sandy Coastal Plain sediments.  Geology at the type location is Sparta Sand of the Tertiary age.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 64 to 68 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 50 inches, and Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 64 to 80.  A summer rainfall ranges from 25 to 30 inches and the summer moisture deficit ranges from 4 to 6 inches."
