  "OVERVIEW": "The Farragut series consists of deep, well drained soils.  These soils formed in a thin layer of colluvium or alluvium and the underlying residuum of shale.  They are on gently sloping to steep uplands.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 35 to 55 inches.  Depth to shale bedrock ranges from 48 to 70 inches or more.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid except where lime has been added.  Coarse fragments range from none to 10 percent in the solum and from 15 to 50 percent in the C horizon.  Depth to shale bedrock ranges from 4 to greater than 5 feet.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4 except severely eroded areas also have chroma of 6.  Texture is silt loam except severely eroded areas are also silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A  horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, to 10R, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Some pedons are mottled with shades of brown, yellow, and red.  Texture is dominantly clay or silty clay but includes silty clay loam.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 or 8 with mottled in shades of yellow, brown, and red.  The fine earth texture is silty clay, silty clay loam or clay."

Gaston soils formed in acid and basic crystalline rocks and have a lower silt content.  Dewey and Dunmore soils have sola more than 60 inches thick.  Sequoia soils have an Ap horizon with moist color value of 4 or more and are mesic."
