They formed in alluvium derived from glacial outwash materials from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.   Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,015 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
