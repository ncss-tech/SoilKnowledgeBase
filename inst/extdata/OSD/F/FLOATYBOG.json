  "OVERVIEW": "The Floatybog series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from glacial outwash materials from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Floatybog soils are on outwash terraces and fans.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
