  "STATES": "AL,GA,KY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Flomaton series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area (MLRA 133A). They formed in gravelly sandy marine sediments. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 62 inches. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. The combined thickness of the A horizon above the zone of lamellae is 25 to 50 inches. Pebbles and cobbles range from 20 to 70 percent, by volume, in the A horizon and from 35 to 70 percent, by volume, in the E, the E&Bt and the Bt horizons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is gravelly sand, very gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 3 through 8. Pebbles and/or cobbles range from 20 to 70 percent, by volume. Texture is gravelly sand, very gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly loamy sand.\nThe E portion of the E&Bt horizon has the same range of colors and texture as the E horizon. The Bt portion is composed of lamellae that have hue of 5Yr or 7.5Yr, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8. The lamellae are thicker in the lower part of some pedons and in places grade into a uniform Bt horizon containing no lamellae. Texture is gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or their very gravelly counterparts.\nThe Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Yr to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8. Texture is gravelly loamy sand, gravelly sandy loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or their very gravelly counterparts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Flomaton soils are on dissected areas of the sloping uplands. Slopes range from 2 percent on ridge tops to 45 percent on side slopes. They formed in marine or stream deposited sands and loams very high in gravel. The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the mean temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 62 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Eustis, Lucy, McLaurin, Norfolk, Orangeburg, Ruston, Saffell, Troup and Wagram series. All of these soils, with the exception of Saffell, have less than 35 percent, by volume, coarse fragments and textures finer than loamy fine sand in all parts of the argillic horizon. All of these soils with the exception of Eustis, lack lamellae in the upper 40 inches of the argillic horizon. The somewhat excessively drained Eustis soils are on higher, less sloping areas. The well drained Lucy and the somewhat excessively drained Wagram soils are on less sloping, higher positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers that are 20 to 40 inches in thickness. In additions, Wagram soils have yellower subsoils. The well drained McLaurin soils are on higher, less sloping areas and have coarse-loamy subsoils. The well drained Norfolk, Orangeburg and Ruston soils are on less sloping, higher positions and have fine-loamy control sections. In addition, Norfolk soils have yellower subsoils and Ruston soils are rhodic. The well drained Saffell soils are on similar positions and have loamy-skeletal control sections. The somewhat excessively drained Troup soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness."
