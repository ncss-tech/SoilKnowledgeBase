  "OVERVIEW": "The Flatnosewash series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and reworked lacustrine deposits derived from welded tuff and small amounts of limestone. Flatnosewash soils are on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
