  "OVERVIEW": "The Fairy series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy slope alluvium derived from sandstone and siltstone over loamy residuum weathered from limestone and siltstone. These soils are on nearly level to sloping base slopes and head slopes of ridges on hills. Slope are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
