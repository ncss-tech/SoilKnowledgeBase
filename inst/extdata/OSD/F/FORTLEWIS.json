  "OVERVIEW": "The Fortlewis series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Fortlewis soils are on mountain slopes and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 508 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
