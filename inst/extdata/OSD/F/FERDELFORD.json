  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture: Usually dry, moist in the winter and spring, but are dry in the summer and early autumn; Aridic soil moisture regime bordering on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature: 8 to 9 degrees C.\nDepth to paralithic contact: 60 to 100 cm.\nHues: 2.5YR to 2.5Y.\nEffervescence: Slightly to violently effervescent.  In a few pedons, the surface few cm are noneffervescent.\nReaction: Moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline, increasing with depth.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 25 to 35 percent.\nRock fragments: Less than 35 percent rock fragments.\nA horizon\nValue: 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3.  The darker colors when mixed to a depth of 18 cm are either too high in color value or too low in organic matter to be a mollic epipedon.  Structure: Moderate or strong, very fine and fine granular, but some pedons are massive.\nBw horizon\nValue: 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4.\nTexture: Loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nRock fragments: Less than l5 percent gravel.\nStructure: subangular blocky or prismatic.\nCk horizon\nValue: 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4.\nTexture: Dominantly clay loam or sandy clay loam.  In some pedons the horizon has thin strata of contrasting sandy or clayey textures.  In some places it contains up to 50 percent gravel and cobbles.\nOther features: High in pyroclastic materials. Secondary commonly is in soft seams and filaments."

The soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded soft calcareous tuff, shale, and tuffaceous sandstone.  The climate is cool and semi-arid with cool moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 95 to l20 days."
