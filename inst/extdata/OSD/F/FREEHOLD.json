  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 45 inches.  Rounded quartzose pebbles are typically absent but range to 5 percent.  The A, B and upper part of the C horizons have 1 to 10 percent glauconite except some pedons have an uncomforming sandy loam or loamy sand mantle, up to 20 inches thick, which is deficient in glauconite.  The soil ranges from strongly to extremely acid.\nThe Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 through 4.  It ranges from loamy sand to loam.  In uncultivated areas there is either a micro-podsol up to four inches thick, or an A1 horizon 1 to 6 inches thick and an A2 or A3 horizon 3 to 12 inches thick.  The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 anc chromas of 2 or 3.  The A2 or A3 horizon is absent under many plowed layers but has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 4 or 5.  The A horizons have weak or moderate granular, subangular blocky or, in the lower part, platy structure.\nThe B horizon has hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 4 through 6 and chromas of 4 through 8.  It is sandy clay loam, loam or sandy loam and has a weighted average clay content of 18 to 25 percent.  It has weak or moderate fine or medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hues of 5YR through 2.5Y.  It is stratified loamy sand or sand with thin strata of sandy loam.  Successive strata have ranges in glauconite content from traces to 20 percent; and differing degrees of iron cementation ranging from weakly cemented layers, up to 12 inches thick, to indurated sheets, up to 1 inche thick."

All of the series in the same family except Collington and Colts Neck soils either lack glauconite or only contain isolated grains.  Collington soils have more than 10 percent glauconite.  Colts Neck soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the B horizon.\nThe Holmdel, Matapeake and Sassafras series are similar soils in related families.  Holmdel soils are mottled within 24 inches of the top of the argillic horizon.  Matapeake and Sassafras soils either lack glauconite or only have isolated grains."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Freehold soils are gently to steeply sloping soils on uplands.  They formed in sandy marine coastal plain sediments which have small to moderate amounts of glauconite except a mantle up to 20 inches  thick may lack glauconite.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches, distributed fairly uniformly throughout the year."
