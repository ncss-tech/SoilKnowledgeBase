  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:   These are the Louin, Naclina, and Vamont series.  Louin soils are acid to a depth of 40 inches or more and have less calcium carbonate concretions in the C horizon.  Naclina soils have subsoils with a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and have less calcium carbonate concretions in the C horizon.  Vamont soils have a thinner A horizon and have less calcium carbonate concretions nodules."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Faunsdale soils are on concave side slopes and toe slopes of the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie. Slopes are commonly 1 to 3 percent, but range from 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in alkaline clays and the underlying chalk.  The climate is humid subtropical. The average annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 56 inches."

Binnsville and Demopolis soils are on higher, more convex slopes and have chalk bedrock within 20 inches of the surface.  Houston and Okolona soils are on higher positions and have a mollic epipedon.  Sumter soils are on slightly higher positions and are moderately deep to chalk bedrock.  Vaiden soils are acid in the upper part of the solum and do not have secondary carbonates within 30 inches of the surface."
