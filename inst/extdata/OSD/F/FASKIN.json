    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is greater than 80 inches.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam, with clay content of 20 to 35 percent.  Depth to a calcic horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons above the Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma that is dominantly 6.  Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam.  Masses of calcium carbonate comprise 10 to 50 percent by volume of this horizon.\nThe Bt horizon below the Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Visible calcium carbonate comprises about 1 to 10 percent, mainly in the form of films, threads and powdery masses.  Some pedons have a petrocalcic horizon at depths below 60 inches."

Douro soils have petrocalcic horizons from 20 to 40 and are on similar postions.  Maljamar soils are in similar positions.  Portales soils have a mollic epipedon and Ratliff soils lack an argillic horizon.  Slaughter and Stegall soils are more clayey and have a petrocalcic horizon."

Family classification of siliceous mineralogy is based on data from closely associated soils.\nThese soils were formerly included in the Berino series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the A horizon from 0 to 8 inches.\nArgillic horizon - the Bt horizons from 8 to 80 inches.\nCalcic horizon - the Btk horizon from 42 to 66 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
