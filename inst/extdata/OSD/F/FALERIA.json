  "OVERVIEW": "The Faleria series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a strong influence from volcanic ash.  The Faleria soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
