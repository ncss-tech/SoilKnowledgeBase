Alcan, Bouncer, Entero, and Zyzzi soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.  Armoine soils are 36 to 50 cm to the paralithic contact.  Berit soils have 50 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Harvan soils have densic materials at 30 to 50 cm. Penelas soils are slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline and have 60 to 75 percent rock fragments that are dominantly shale channers in the particle-size control section.  Ravenell soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 14 degrees C. Sedsked soils hare slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Soar soils are dominated by fine granitic gravel, have high content of coarse and very coarse sand, and have hard, unweathered bedrock within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Stodick soils are 36 to 50 cm to the paralithic contact, have an abrupt boundary between the A and Bt horizons, and have 25 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
