  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

The Bw horizons do not constitute a cambic horizon because combined thickness does not meet minimum thickness requirement of 15 cm.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 6 to 16 percent.\nSand content: Averages 60 to 75 percent total with more than 30 percent very coarse sand through medium sand;\nRock fragments: Averages 15 to 25 percent, mainly gravel. Lithology of fragments are tuff-breccia or basaltic tuff.\nA horizon\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nStructure: Granular or platy parting to granular.\nOrganic matter:  0.1 to 0.4 percent\nBw1 horizon\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.\nTextures: Gravelly coarse sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nClay content: 8 to 16 percent.\nRock fragments: 15 to 30 percent.\nBw2 horizon (when present)\nValue: 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture: Sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nClay content: 10 to 16 percent.\nRock fragments: 10 to 20 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Firelake soils are on structural benches and hills. These soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from tuff-breccia or basaltic tuff. Minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash are also components of the parent materials. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,555 meters. The climate is arid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Brace soils fine-loamy, moderately deep to thin duripans over lithic contacts, and have argillic horizons. Boilout soils have argillic horizons and are shallow to thin duripans over lithic contacts. Enko soils are coarse-loamy and very deep. Rabbithills soils are loamy, shallow to duripans, have cambic horizons, and do not have bedrock within 150 cm."
