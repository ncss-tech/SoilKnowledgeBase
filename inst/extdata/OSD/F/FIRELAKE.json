  "OVERVIEW": "The Firelake series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from tuff-breccia. Firelake soils are on structural benches and hills. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

The Bw horizons do not constitute a cambic horizon because combined thickness does not meet minimum thickness requirement of 15 cm.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 6 to 16 percent.\nSand content: Averages 60 to 75 percent total with more than 30 percent very coarse sand through medium sand;\nRock fragments: Averages 15 to 25 percent, mainly gravel. Lithology of fragments are tuff-breccia or basaltic tuff.\nA horizon\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nStructure: Granular or platy parting to granular.\nOrganic matter:  0.1 to 0.4 percent\nBw1 horizon\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.\nTextures: Gravelly coarse sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nClay content: 8 to 16 percent.\nRock fragments: 15 to 30 percent.\nBw2 horizon (when present)\nValue: 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture: Sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.\nClay content: 10 to 16 percent.\nRock fragments: 10 to 20 percent."

The climate is arid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
