  "OVERVIEW": "The Flarm series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils in depressions and swales on uplands.  They are formed in weathered ash over colluvium.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
