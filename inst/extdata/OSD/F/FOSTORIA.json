  "OVERVIEW": "The Fostoria series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial sediments of mixed lithology.  These soils are on nearly level to slightly concave positions on till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.",
