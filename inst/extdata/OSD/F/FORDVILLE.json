  "OVERVIEW": "The Fordville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy sediments that are moderately deep over sand and gravel on outwash plains and terraces. Permeability is moderate in the upper mantle and very rapid in the underlying sand and gravel. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Depth to sand and gravel typically is about 24 to 34 inches and ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 moist and 1 or 2 dry, but some pedons have chroma of 2 moist below the Ap horizon. It typically is loam but silt loam is also included. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam averaging between 18 and 30 percent clay. It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically is loam or clay loam, but in some places, is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. The Bk horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe 2Bk and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. The less than 2 mm fraction is loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand. Coarse fragment content ranges from 15 to 50 percent. Thin strata of finer textures are in some pedons. It is slightly or moderately alkaline."
