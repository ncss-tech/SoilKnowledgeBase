  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 30 inches and commonly includes the Bw horizon. Depth to sand and gravel typically is about 24 to 34 inches and ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 moist and 1 or 2 dry, but some pedons have chroma of 2 moist below the Ap horizon. It typically is loam but silt loam is also included. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam averaging between 18 and 30 percent clay. It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically is loam or clay loam, but in some places, is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. The Bk horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe 2Bk and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. The less than 2 mm fraction is loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand. Coarse fragment content ranges from 15 to 50 percent. Thin strata of finer textures are in some pedons. It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Fordtown, Spottswood and Vang series. The Fordtown soils have saturation within depths of 3.5 feet. The Spottswood soils have redox features within depths of 40 inches and are moderately well drained. Vang soils have 50 percent or more coarse shale fragments within depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fordville soils are on outwash plains and terraces of streams that dissect the glacial till plains. Surfaces are plane to convex. Slope gradients range from 0 to 9 percent. The soil formed in loamy alluvium over stratified sand and gravel. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches. The growing season is about 120 to 140 days; the average growing season precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches. The growing degree days are about 2,500 to 3,000. Elevation ranges from 1,300 to 2,000 feet above sea level."

Spottswood, Divide, and Marysland soils are on lower and wetter parts of the outwash plains and terraces. Renshaw soils have a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick, are shallow to gravel, and are on slightly higher positions. Divide and Marysland soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches. Sioux soils have sand and gravel at depths of less than 14 inches and are higher convex positions."
