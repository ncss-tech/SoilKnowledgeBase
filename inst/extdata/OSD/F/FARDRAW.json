  "OVERVIEW": "The Fardraw series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium from mixed sources. Fardraw soils are on fan remnants and relict stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
