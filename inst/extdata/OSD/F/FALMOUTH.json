  "OVERVIEW": "The Falmouth series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on uplands of the North Central Florida Ridge.  They formed in thick clayey marine deposits in upper Central Florida.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A, E, Bt, and Btg horizons and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the Cg horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Where the value is 3 or less, it is less than 7 inches in thickness.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6; or there is no dominant color and it is mixed in shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, yellow, brown, or gray range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Some pedons have upper Bt horizons having sandy clay loam textures that are less than 8 inches thick.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has the same range of colors and textures as the Btg horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.
