  "OVERVIEW": "The Farva series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium weathered from volcanic rocks.  Farva soils are on mountains and have slopes of 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages 45 to 80 percent rock fragments, of which 5 to 20 percent are stones, 25 to 35 percent are cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent are gravel and it is 15 to 25 percent clay.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist, but is dry between 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days or more in the four months following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe B and C horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.
