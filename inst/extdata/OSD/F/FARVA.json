  "OVERVIEW": "The Farva series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium weathered from volcanic rocks.  Farva soils are on mountains and have slopes of 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
