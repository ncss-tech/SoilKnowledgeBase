    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 41 to 76 centimeters (16 to 30 inches) and may include part or all the Bw horizon. The clay content of the upper mantle is 18 to 27 percent and 18 to 35 percent in the underlying till material. The depth to glacial till typically is about 76 centimeters (30 inches) and ranges between 51 and 102 centimeters (20 and 40 inches). The depth to carbonates typically is about 76 centimeters (30 inches) and ranges between 61 and 102 centimeters (24 and 40 inches). A thin stone line is at the upper boundary of the 2Bk in some pedons. The upper mantle typically does not have rock fragments and the underlying till has 2 to 10 percent, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1. It typically is loam, but includes fine sandy loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is typically loam, but may have thin layers of clay loam or fine sandy loam in some pedons. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have Bk horizons.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Few or common, faint to prominent redoximorphic features are in most pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Common or many, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are in most pedons."
