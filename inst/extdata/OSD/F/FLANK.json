The soil moisture control section is dry for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Phosphate retention is 10 to 25 percent.  Volcanic glass content is 40 to 80 percent.  The acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  The mollic colors throughout the profile are from the parent material.  The depth to hard bedrock is 4 to 15 inches.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 70 percent gravel sized cinders and 5 to 18 percent clay.  Some pedons have a thin Cr horizon above the bedrock.\nThe A horizon has textures of gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly sandy loam and extremely gravelly loamy sand.  Rock fragment content is 25 to 70 percent by volume.\nThe Bw or C horizon is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam and extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 35 to 70 percent by volume."
