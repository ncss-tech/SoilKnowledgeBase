Elevations are commonly 400 to 1,150 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bearthicket, Deible, Higdon, Relfe, Sandbur, Tanglenook, and Zanoni soils. All of these are on similar landscape positions as Farewell soils. Bearthicket soils are well drained and are in the fine-silty family. Deible and Tanglenook soils are poorly drained and are in the fine family. Higdon soils have an ochric epipedon and are in the fine-silty family. Relfe soils are excessively drained and are in the sandy-skeletal family. Sandbur and Zanoni soils are well drained and are in the coarse-loamy family."

Most areas are subject to flooding.  These soils have an apparent water table within 18 inches of the surface during wet periods in most years."
