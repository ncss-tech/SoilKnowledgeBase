    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Content of silt plus clay to more than 80 inches is less than 5 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to mildly alkaline throughout.  Few to many fine dark minerals and few shell fragments are in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sand or sand.\nThe upper part of the C horizon dominantly has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It ranges from 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The lower part of the C horizon dominantly has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 6 or 8, and chroma of 0 to 3, and ranges to chroma of 3 to 8.  The C horizon is sand or fine sand. Low chroma is not due to wetness."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kershaw, Newhan, Ortega, and Penney series.  Kershaw and Ortega soils are not subject to flooding.  In addition, Ortega soils have a seasonal high water table at 3.5 to 5.0 feet.  Newhan soils are affected by salt spray and do not support commercial tree growth.  Penney soils have lamellae.  Buncombe, Crevasse, Lakeland, Tarboro, and Wando series are in similar families.  These soils contain more than 5 percent silt plus clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fripp soils are on undulating to steep dunes commonly adjoining beaches and waterways along the coast.  These soils receive such a small quantity of salt spray that the growth of trees is not affected.  Most areas are 5 to 25 feet above mean tide.  Flooding is none to rare; when rare, it is flooded for very brief periods due to very high tides caused by coastal storms.  Slopes commonly are 5 to 15 percent but range from 2 to 30 percent.  The soil formed in sandy sediments that have been reworked by wind and wave action.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 44 to 50 inches, and frost-free season ranges from 260 to 290 days."

Baratari, Ridgeland, Rosedhu, and Seewee soils have a spodic horizon.  Capers soils are subject to daily tidal flooding and are fine textured. Corolla and Duckston soils have a seasonal high water table.  Kiawah soils have an argillic horizon.  Polawana soils have an umbric epipedon.  Seabrook soils contain 5 to 20 percent silt plus clay in the control section."
