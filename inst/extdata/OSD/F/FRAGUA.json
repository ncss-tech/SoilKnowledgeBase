  "OVERVIEW": "The Fragua series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat excessively and well drained, moderately and moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium, stream alluvium, fan alluvium, colluvium and eolian deposits derived from sandstone. These soils are on summits of mesas, dipslopes of cuestas, fan remnants of valley sides, hills, breaks and footslopes. Slopes range from 1 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Eva soils are formed in eolian parent material on dunes. Fraguni soils are neutral, do not have C or Bk horizons, do not have rock fragments in the soil, have cooler mean annual air temperatures and receive more effective winter precipitation. Vona and Vonalf soils have hues yellower than 10YR. Xema soils are moderately deep. In addition, Eva, Vona, Vonalf, and Xema soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June."
