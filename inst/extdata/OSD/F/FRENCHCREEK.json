  "OVERVIEW": "The Frenchcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
