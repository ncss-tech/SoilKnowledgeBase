  "BYREV": "BDM-MRL",
  "REVDATE": "06/2005",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fetterman series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from red calcareous sandstone. Fetterman soils are on bedrock controlled footslopes and toeslopes of scarps and hogbacks. Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
