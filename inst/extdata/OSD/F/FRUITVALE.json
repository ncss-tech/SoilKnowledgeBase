    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 4 to 20 inches.  (Btk horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 4 inches. (Ap horizon)\nSecondary carbonates:  In the zone from 4 to 60 inches.\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 4 to 20 inches.  (Btk horizons)\nGypsic horizon:  The zone from 20 to 60 inches.  (2Bkyz and 2BCky horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity:  The contact with clayey materials at 20 inches.\nThe pedon was moved to this location to better reflect the revised concept for the series.  Additional lab data confirmed the presence of a gypsic horizon.  The classification was changed from fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplargids to fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Argigypsids May 2004.  The cation exchange activity class is inferred from laboratory data taken from similar soils in the area.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This series was mapped as Fruita clay loam, moderately deep, in the Grand Junction Area, Colorado Soil Survey report series 1940, No. 19, issued November 1955.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
