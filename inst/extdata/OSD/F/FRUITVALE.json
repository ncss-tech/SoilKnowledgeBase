  "OVERVIEW": "The Fruitvale series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow over slowly permeable soils on terraces.  They formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale over residuum weathered from clayey shale.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 51 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

(Btk horizons)\nGypsic horizon:  The zone from 20 to 60 inches.  (2Bkyz and 2BCky horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity:  The contact with clayey materials at 20 inches.\nThe pedon was moved to this location to better reflect the revised concept for the series.  Additional lab data confirmed the presence of a gypsic horizon.  The classification was changed from fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplargids to fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Typic Argigypsids May 2004.  The cation exchange activity class is inferred from laboratory data taken from similar soils in the area.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This series was mapped as Fruita clay loam, moderately deep, in the Grand Junction Area, Colorado Soil Survey report series 1940, No. 19, issued November 1955.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
