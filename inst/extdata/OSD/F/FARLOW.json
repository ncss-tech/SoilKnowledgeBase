  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to hard limestone and lithic contact ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Depth to continuous horizons of carbonate accumulation ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 35 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from about 53 to 58 degrees F.  The particle size control section has matrix texture of loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments average from 35 to 80 percent and consist of channers, cobbles, or angular gravel with 0 to 15 percent flagstones near the lithic contact.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw or BA horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent.  This is a diagnostic calcic horizon.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  A C horizon is present in some pedons above the lithic contact."

The Antrobus, Basinpeak, Broad Canyon, Gaia, Greyback, Handran, Klug, Lag, Maurice, McCort, Midfork, Sebud, Silvercliff, Sup, Teemat, Thornburgh, Tiban, Timmercrek, and Wareagle soils are very deep.   Decram, Foxmount, Grafen, Krackle, Middlehill, Parachute, Rockabin, and Supervisor soils are moderately deep.  Fairydell soils have accumulations of silica in the Bk horizon.  Kamack and Tineman soils are non-calcareous throughout.  Midlight soils lack a diagnostic calcic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Farlow soils are on mountain and hill footslopes, backslopes, and upper toeslopes. It is also on terraces and upper fan aprons.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered primarily from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. Elevations are 6,000 to 9,000 feet.  In Colorado elevations are as high as 10,250 feet  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches but ranges from 13 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees but ranges from 33 to 44 degrees F. The estimated frost-free season is 60 days or less depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
