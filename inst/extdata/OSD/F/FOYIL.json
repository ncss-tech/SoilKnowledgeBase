  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Foyil soils are on slopes of hills and valleys constructed after strip mining operations; reclamation operations resulted in landforms similar to pre-mining contours. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. The soils were excavated and replaced with loamy and clayey material weathered from sandstone and shale of Pennsylvanian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1321 mm (38 to 52 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 13.9 to 16.7 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F). Frost-free period is 200 to 240 days. Elevation is 152.4 to 304.8 meters (500 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices is: greater than 64."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils are the result of post-1977 strip mining.  The landscape was returned to its original elevation and contour, and topsoil was returned to the site.  The subsurface is formed in replaced soil and rock fragments from shale and sandstone of Pennsylvanian age.  The substratum is a mixture of shale and sandstone overburden moved during mining.  The topsoil was stripped and replaced on-site or on adjacent mined sites.  Constructed drainage channels and rectangular or linear ponds are characteristic of reclaimed areas.\nDiagnostic horizon and features in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 58 cm (10 to 23 inches).\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches).  This horizon is composed of former mollic epipedons from the original soils.  It meets the color and organic carbon requirement for the mollic epipedon, but is hard and massive when dry.\nDensic contact: 58 cm (23 inches).  Dense, root restricting earthy material mixed with shale pararock fragments.\nBase saturation is more than 35 percent.\nUdic moisture regime: moisture control section is dry in some part less than 90 days per year.\nTaxonomy version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, twelfth edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
