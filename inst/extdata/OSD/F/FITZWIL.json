  "OVERVIEW": "The Fitzwil series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foothills, mountains, and plateaus. Slopes are 4 to 25 percent. These soils formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from volcanic ash and other sources. Fitzwil soils have moderate permeability. The average annual temperature is about 36 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",
