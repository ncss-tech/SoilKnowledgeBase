    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Fitzwil soils are on foothill and mountain summits and plateaus. Slopes range from 4 to 25 percent. Elevations range from 6,500 to 9,400 feet. The soil formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from loess, volcanic ash and rhyolitic tuff or mixed alluvium. The average annual precipitation is about 25 to 30 inches. It falls dominantly in late autumn through early summer. Winter snowpack of greater than 5 feet in depth and lasting through May are common. Average air temperature is about 34 to 38 degrees F. The frost-free season is 15 to 50 days."
