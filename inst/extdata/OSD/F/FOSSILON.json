    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 38 degrees to 41 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is 55 degrees to 58 degrees F. Depth to hard marlstone or limestone is 6 to 20 inches.  Limestone or marlstone channery is 35 to 50 percent. Calcium carbonate equivalent including channery less than 20 mm. in diameter is more than 40 percent. The A and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 10YR; value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3. These horizons are channery loam, channery silt loam, channery clay loam, or channery silty clay loam. These horizons are moderately or strongly alkaline."
