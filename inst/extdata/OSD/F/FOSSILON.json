Depth to hard marlstone or limestone is 6 to 20 inches.  Limestone or marlstone channery is 35 to 50 percent. Calcium carbonate equivalent including channery less than 20 mm. in diameter is more than 40 percent. The A and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 10YR; value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3. These horizons are channery loam, channery silt loam, channery clay loam, or channery silty clay loam. These horizons are moderately or strongly alkaline."
