  "OVERVIEW": "The Freshkills series consists of very deep, well drained soils on anthropogenic landforms. These soils formed in a thick mantle of human transported material that includes loamy soil material over a geomembrane over a mixture of household garbage, construction debris and other discarded materials layered with human transported soil material. These soils occur in landfills on artificial landscapes in and near major urbanized areas of the Northeast. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or moderately high in the loamy mantle. Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1262 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the loamy mantle and geomembrane over the refuse is 76 to 120 cm; and the total thickness of the landfill materials is generally more than 1.5 m. The human transported soil material that forms the loamy mantle may be any geologic deposit ranging from till, outwash, alluvium, coastal/marine sediments, or residuum. Rock fragments range from 1 to 20 percent, and textures are typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam but may include sandy clay loam or loamy sand. Fragments, both rock and human artifacts combined, range from 35 to 75 percent in the refuse layer. Some pedons have mottles in the fill cap that are unrelated to soil water related redoximorphic process.\nThe ^A or ^Ap horizon has a hue of 2.5 Y to 2.5 YR, value of 3, 4, or 5, and a chroma of 2 to 6. Structure is weak or moderate granular or weak subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable to friable. Reaction ranges from very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe ^Bw or ^Bwu horizons, if present, have hue of 2.5 Y to 2.5 YR, values of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Structure is subangular blocky, lenticular, or platy. Consistence is firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe ^C or ^Cu horizons above the geomembrane, if present, have a hue of 2.5 Y to 2.5 YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Structure is platy or massive. Consistence is firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe M horizon, or geomembrane, is a continuous layer of 40 mil (1 millimeter or 0.001 centimeters) thick high-density polyethylene geomembrane.\nThe ^Cu horizons below the geomembrane contain layers of municipal refuse and human transported soil and rock material. Human artifacts in the refuse include paper, cardboard, carpet, cloth, plastic, glass, metal, organic waste, and rubber. There is a smaller component of construction materials such as asphalt, brick, concrete, treated and untreated lumber, metal, plasterboard, plus small amounts of coal ash. Household objects range from gravel to stone-sized, and construction materials range from gravel to boulder size. There is a distinction between artifacts that will hold water, allow roots to penetrate and decompose versus those that are impenetrable, persistent and function similar to rock fragments. Examples of impenetrable persistent artifacts are glass, plastic, rubber, and treated lumber. Generally, the human transported soil material is similar to the soil mantle over the geomembrane. The texture of the human transported soil material ranges from loamy sand to silt loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline. Consistence is loose to firm. Some intermittent layers or materials, such as plastic, act as a barrier to root and water movement."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Freshkills soils are on nearly level to very steep modified landforms in landfill area. These soils formed in a mixture of municipal refuse and human transported soil material with a cap of human transported soil material that is relatively low in or absent of human artifacts. The human transported soil material is sourced from a variety of local soil materials such as till, outwash, dredge, coastal/marine sediments, and/or residuum.\nDominant fragments in the substratum are human artifacts, with smaller amounts of igneous, metamorphic, and/or sedimentary rock fragments. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1270 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 17 degrees C."

Centralpark, Greenbelt, and North Meadow soils average less than 10 percent artifacts in the control section and do not occur on municipal refuse landfills. Gravesend and Oldmill soils are sandy-skeletal and sandy and occur on unlined landfills; Greatkills soils are loamy-skeletal and occur on unlined landfills; Kleinekill occurs on landfills with a clay liner; Laguardia and Secaucus soils average more than 35 percent total coarse fragments and more than 10 percent artifacts in the control section and do not occur on municipal refuse landfills."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or moderately high in the loamy mantle above the geomembrane. The geomembrane is impermeable."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",

Sites are often mowed or otherwise managed to discourage establishment of woody plant species.  Recreational use and access are generally restricted, however some landfill areas are commissioned into parks."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Freshkills typical pedon has been drafted from a combination of field observation and soil property concepts based on landfill cover specifications established by New York City Department of Sanitation (DSNY). These specifications are based on Type I and Type II Final Cover defined in DSNY's Final Cover Design Report for Sections 1/9 and 6/7. Every effort has been made to create a representative pedon based on these specificiations; however public health concern has prevented field staff from gathering standard documentation and field verifying the cover specifications for Freshkills soils.\nFreshkills soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition; excluding them from the concept of Fluvents. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy will help to clarify this difference.\nSome areas develop anaerobic conditions in the subsoil due to methane gas emissions, which may promote the formation of redoximorphic features without saturation by water.\nOne year soil temperature data is available for 10 cm and 50 cm depths. A poster describing temperature investigations is referenced below. The internal soil temperature has been modified by high levels of biological activity and garbage undergoing rapid decomposition. The classification as hyperthermic is the subject of some debate but the study and lab data support the hyperthermic soil temperature classification. The area would typically be mesic.\nReference: Mount, Henry and Luis Hernandez. Temperature Signatures for Urban Soils of New York City. Poster session presented at: First International Conference on Soils of Urban, Industrial, Traffic, and Mining Areas; 2000 Jul 12-18; Essen, Germany.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (^Au horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 15 to 76 centimeters (2^Bwu horizon).\n3. Oxyaquic subgroup - predicted saturation within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface based on soil design features.\n4. Developments in the classification of this anthropogenic soils may result in changes in the taxonomic classification.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
