  "OVERVIEW": "The Flemingcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on terrace escarpments.  They formed in glaciolacustrine sediments.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 35 to 65 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",
