  "OVERVIEW": "The Faxon series consists of moderately deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in a mantle of glacial drift over bedrock on rock-cored terraces and structural benches. These soils have moderate permeability. Their slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches. Free carbonates commonly occur in at least some part of the A horizon, but they do not occur in all parts of the 10 to 20 inch depth zone. In some pedons, free carbonates are in a part of the B horizon. In some pedons, the horizon adjacent to the bedrock contains as much as 35 percent coarse fragments of mixed lithology. The remainder of the solum contains from 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick. Between depths of 10 inches and the upper boundary of the bedrock, the average content of clay is 18 to 32 percent and of sand coarser than very fine, 15 to 45 percent. An O horizon up to 6 inches in thickness is in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or it is N 2/0 or N 3/0. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. It has few snail shells in some pedons.\nThe B horizon has a matrix with hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 in the upper part and 1 to 4 in the lower part, or it is N 4/0 or N 5/0. It lacks mottles in some parts in some pedons. It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2R horizon is quartzite or sandstone in a few pedons."
