  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches. Free carbonates commonly occur in at least some part of the A horizon, but they do not occur in all parts of the 10 to 20 inch depth zone. In some pedons, free carbonates are in a part of the B horizon. In some pedons, the horizon adjacent to the bedrock contains as much as 35 percent coarse fragments of mixed lithology. The remainder of the solum contains from 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick. Between depths of 10 inches and the upper boundary of the bedrock, the average content of clay is 18 to 32 percent and of sand coarser than very fine, 15 to 45 percent. An O horizon up to 6 inches in thickness is in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or it is N 2/0 or N 3/0. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. It has few snail shells in some pedons.\nThe B horizon has a matrix with hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 in the upper part and 1 to 4 in the lower part, or it is N 4/0 or N 5/0. It lacks mottles in some parts in some pedons. It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2R horizon is quartzite or sandstone in a few pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clyde, Colwood, Gansner, Kossuth, Letri, Reddick, Selma, Tripoli, Webster, and Wolcott series in the same family. All of these soils do not have a lithic contact within depths of less than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Faxon soils have plane or slightly concave slopes on rock-cored terraces or structural benches. Slope gradient is less than 2 percent. These soils formed in a loamy mantle of glacial drift primarily glacial alluvium, that is 20 to 40 inches thick. The underlying material is limestone, quartzite or sandstone bedrock. Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Copaston, Etter, and the Joliet soils. Copaston and Etter soils are well drained and are on higher and/or more sloping terrain. Joliet soils are poorly drained and have bedrock within depths of 20 inches."
