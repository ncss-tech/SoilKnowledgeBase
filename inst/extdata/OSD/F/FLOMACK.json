  "OVERVIEW": "The Flomack series consists of shallow, well drained soils on mountain slopes. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from serpentinite. Slope is 30 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches (51 centimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C. (61 degrees F).",
