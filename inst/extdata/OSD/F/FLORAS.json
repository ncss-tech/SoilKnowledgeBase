  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Floras soils are on metastable to active side slopes of forested coastal hills and mountains. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from metasedimentary or metavolcanics. Elevations are 61 to 396 meters (200 to 1,300 feet). The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature. The mean annual precipitation is 2286 to 3002 millimeters (90 to 130 inches). The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). The frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."

Guerin soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) deep to a lithic contact and are loamy-skeletal. Loeb, Macklyn, and Vondergreen soils have argillic horizons. Wedderburn soils are 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) deep to a lithic contact and are fine-loamy.
