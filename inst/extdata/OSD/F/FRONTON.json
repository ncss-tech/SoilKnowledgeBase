  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum typically ranges from 13 to 20 inches but can range to near 30 inches.  Depth to weathered shale bedrock is typically 20 inches or less but occasionally the shale has been altered to the extent that original rock structure has been altered sufficiently to make it difficult to identify to a depth of about 40 inches.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 8 to 18 inches.  The ca horizon is not pronounced and the calcium carbonate equivalent does not exceed 15 percent.  Quartz gravel content of the solum ranges from 20 to 50 percent with an occasional cobble while the surface gravel cover ranges from 50 to 90 percent.  Reaction of the solum ranges from neutral in the upper part to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Color of the A horizon ranges in hue from 10YR to 7.5YR, in chroma from 2 through 4 and in value from 5 through 6 dry and 3 through 4 moist.  A horizons with values of 5 dry and 3 moist must be less than 1/3 as thick as the solum.  Color of the B horizon ranges in hue from 7.5YR to slightly reddish than 5YR, in chroma from 2 through 4, and in value from 5 through 7 dry and 4 through 6 moist.\nTexture of the B horizon is typically a gravelly clay but ranges to a gravelly heavy clay loam.  Structure of the B2t horizon ranges from strong to moderate and often includes some peds that are angular blocky.   The shale bedrock typically includes thin strata of sandstone ranging from soft to hard."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include Cuates, Malaposa, Hassell, Hondo, Fernando and Renohill soils in the same family.  The Cuates soils are typically less red in hue and are nongravelly.  The Malaposa soils are derived from basic igneous material high in basalt gravel over shale and interbedded sandstone.  The Hassell soils are nongravelly.  The Hondo and Fernando soils are nongravelly, have a strong lime zone typically within 30 inches of the surface and have no shale to depths greater than 40 inches.  The Renohill soils are of yellower hues in the B horizon and  are nongravelly."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Fronton soils occur on gently sloping to steep dissected fans and mountain foot-slopes.  The regolith consists of gravelly sediments derived principally from acid igneous formations that now overly shale and interbedded sandstone.  The gravels are well rounded and composed mainly of quartz.  The climate is continental.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The average annual temperature (air) is about 50 degrees F. and the average summer temperature (air) is about 65 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is ranges from about 20 to 40."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Fronton soils occur in association with the Persayo, Chipeta, Travessilla, and Las Lucas soils.  Persayo and Chipeta soils are shallower to shale.  Travessilla soils are shallow to sandstone.  Las Lucas soils have clay loam control section textures and lack an argillic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Fronton soils were formerly classified in the Brown soil group.  The Fronton series has been in the past classified as a Typic Haplargid but it is believed that with present criteria of the Soil Classification system it may be more appropriate in the subgroup Mollic Haplargid.\nThe family minerology designation is also tentative as at present it has not been established that mixed is any more appropriate than montmorillonitic.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.  Last revised by state on 10/65.\nIn October 2000, taxonomic classification was converted to the closest match found in Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition 1999.  No update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
