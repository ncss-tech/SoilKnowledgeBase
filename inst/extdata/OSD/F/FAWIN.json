  "OVERVIEW": "The Fawin series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from sandy alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Fawin soils are on mountain valleys, alluvial flats, fan skirts and fan aprons.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
