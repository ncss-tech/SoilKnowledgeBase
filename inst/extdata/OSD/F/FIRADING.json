  "OVERVIEW": "The Firading series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium from limestone. These soils are on convex hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. Permeability is moderate. The mean annual precipitation is about 381 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.",
