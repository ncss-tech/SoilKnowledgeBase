Farmell soils are usually dry but are moist in some parts between 4 to 12 inches for a cumulative period equal to less than one-half of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F., and moist between depths of 4 to 12 inches for at least 60 days out of the 120 days following the winter solstice and are dry for 45 consecutive days or more between 4 to 12 inches within the 4-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 18 to 36 inches.  The soils lack rock fragments.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 6 dry and 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, chroma of 2, 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, clay or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Clay films are common to continuous and faint to distinct.  It has weak or moderate prismatic and moderate or strong subangular or blocky structure.  It is slightly to moderately alkaline."

Diaz soils are strongly effervescent at 12 to 24 inches and are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Glasgow and Trunk soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Lanktree soils have an E horizon and are neutral to slightly alkaline and lack the high silt of the Farmell soils.  Oppio soils are neutral to moderately acid and have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 30 inches.  Risley soils are 20 to 30 inches to a paralithic contact.  Schamp soils have formed in loamy alluvium superimposed over very cobbly loam alluvium and lack the high silt of the Farmell soils.  Buncelvoir soils have carbonates at depths of 10 to 18 inches."
