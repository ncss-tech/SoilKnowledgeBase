  "STATES": "KS,NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Filley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial outwash deposits that have been reworked by wind.  Filley soils are on uplands.  Slopes range from 6 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F. at the type location.",
