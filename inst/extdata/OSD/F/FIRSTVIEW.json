    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 to 55 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F. Coarse fragments are usually less than 5 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The upper (20 inches) argillic horizon averages less than 35 percent clay.  Depth to lime is 0 to 20 inches.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, 3 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The upper part is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and the lower part is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.  The lower part usually contains visible salt and gypsum crystals.\nIf the upper part of the C horizon is less than 40 inches deep it averages more than 35 percent clay.  Textures below 40 inches range from sandy clay loam to clay.  Stratification of loamy sand to clay and mottles occur in some pedons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The name is taken from a small community in Cheyenne County.  This soil was mapped and correlated as a variant of the Keyner series in Kiowa County, Colorado.  The former classification of Haplustollic Natrarids has been revised due to NSSL data received 6/84 which indicated the concept is in the Ustollic Natrargid subgroup.  Diagnostic horizons include mollic colors from 0 to 13 inches; natric horizons from 13 to 27 inches in the upper sequence of horizons; and a lithologic discontinuity at 27 inches.  This revision updates the classification from an Ustollic Natrargid to an Ustic Natrargid.  (1994 Amendments to Soil Taxonomy).  Last updated by the state 3/95.\nThe Btnz1 and Btnz2 horizons are a Salic horizon at the type location.  At this time, 12/99, Classification is not changed to a Typic Haplosalids per the 1999 second edition of Soil Taxonomy due to a proposed change to the Keys.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
