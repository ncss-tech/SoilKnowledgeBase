  "OVERVIEW": "The Frisco series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium, till, slope alluvium or slide deposits. These soils are on mountain slopes, moraines, dip slopes and landslides. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.1 degrees C.",
