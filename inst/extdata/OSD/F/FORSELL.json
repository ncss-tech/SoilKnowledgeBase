  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Forsell soils are on moraines superimposed on mountains.  They typically occur on footslope and backslope positions.  They formed in till derived mainly from granodiorite with minor amounts of metamorphic rocks such as quartzite and gneiss.   Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,500 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches, the mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
