  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 59 degrees F. (12 to 15 degrees C.) The difference in soil temperature between mean summer and mean winter is less than 6 degrees C. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about mid-September to mid-November (about 60 days) and is usually moist the rest of the time.\nDepth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches (152 centimeters).\nDepth to abrupt clay increase is 6 to 28 inches (15 to 70 centimeters). High variability of depth to clay is due to disturbance and erosion caused by animals, mostly wild pigs.\nBase saturation by sum of bases ranges from 38 to 73 percent.\nDepth to lithologic discontinuity ranges from 6 to 22 inches, but does not occur in all pedons. Mollic epipedon thickness is always more than 15 inches (38 centimeters) often extending into the argillic horizon.\nThe particle size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 4 percent to a depth of at least 20 inches (50 centimeters). Reaction is extremely acid to neutral throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 4/2 or 3/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 2/2, or 2/1.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, or 3/1. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/2, 2/1 or 2/2.\nClay content ranges from 30 to 60 percent.\nTextures are dominantly very gravelly clay with some gravelly clay, extremely gravelly clay, gravelly clay loam, and very gravelly clay loam."
