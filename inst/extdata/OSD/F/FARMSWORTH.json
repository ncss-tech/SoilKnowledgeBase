  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 60 inches and typically includes all of the Btn horizon.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Typically, the column tops are evident and are hard and durable when dry. Typically, the Btn horizon is clay or silty clay averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It is clay loam or silty clay loam in some pedons. It has few or common, faint mottles in the lower part of some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid in the upper part to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Some pedons have accumulations of salts in the lower part as a Btnz horizon.\nThe Bkz horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay and ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have Bk, Bz, or BC horizons. Some pedons do not have accumulations of gypsum or other salts in the Bk or BC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Typically, it is clay or silty clay but range from clay loam to sandy clay loam in the lower part of some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Strata of coarser textures are between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons. Some pedons have buried horizons below a depth of 30 inches. The Bkz and C horizons have few to many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate and nests of gypsum. They have few to many, fine to coarse faint to distinct mottles."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cavo, DeGrey, Dudley, Dwight, Mosher, and Wood River series.  Cavo, Dudley, Mosher, and Wood River soils contain more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  In addition, Cavo, DeGrey, Mosher, and Wood River soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  DeGrey soils do not have mottles in the underlying material due to wetness.  Dwight soils have air warmer soil temperature control sections and mean annual temperature greater than 50 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Farmsworth soils are on broad, low lying flats in glacial outwash plains.  Slope gradients are less than 2 percent. Surfaces are plane to slightly concave and have micro-relief with differences in elevation of 2 feet or less.  The soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine and alluvial sediments.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 21 inches. Growing season is about 130 to 155 days; growing season precipitation is 13 to 17 inches; and growing degree days are about 2800 to 3200."
