  "OVERVIEW": "The Farmsworth series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or moderately well drained soils that have dense compact subsoils.  These soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine and alluvial sediments within glacial outwash plains or on flood plains. Permeability is slow or very slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and is medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Typically, the column tops are evident and are hard and durable when dry. Typically, the Btn horizon is clay or silty clay averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It is clay loam or silty clay loam in some pedons. It has few or common, faint mottles in the lower part of some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid in the upper part to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Some pedons have accumulations of salts in the lower part as a Btnz horizon.\nThe Bkz horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay and ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have Bk, Bz, or BC horizons. Some pedons do not have accumulations of gypsum or other salts in the Bk or BC horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Typically, it is clay or silty clay but range from clay loam to sandy clay loam in the lower part of some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Strata of coarser textures are between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons. Some pedons have buried horizons below a depth of 30 inches. The Bkz and C horizons have few to many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate and nests of gypsum. They have few to many, fine to coarse faint to distinct mottles."
