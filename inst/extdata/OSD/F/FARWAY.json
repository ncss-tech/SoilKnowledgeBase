Brannon soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice, and are 100 to 150 cm deep to a lithic contact. Saska soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Capoose, Olot, Rouen, and Vingulch soils are 50 to 102 cm to bedrock.  Crackler soils are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice and lack parent material of glacial origin.  Elbowlake soils are ashy silt loam in the upper part of the particle-size control section and are moderately deep to a densic contact with glacial till.  Kellerbutte soils have angular to very angular rock fragments and lack parent material of glacial origin.  Kootenai soils are coarse sand or loamy coarse sand in the lower part of the particle-size control section. Natapoc and Nevine soils are moderately deep to a densic contact with glacial till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Farway soils are on valley wall, debris apron, Pleistocene moraine, and Pleistocene terrace landforms at elevations of 500 to 1,500 meters.  Slope range from 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium and reworked glacial drift.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 500 to 800 millimeters. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 2 to 9 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 115 days."

Gatewall soils are on backslopes and are cryic.  Goode soils are on the more active portions of all the same landforms and have a mantle with andic soil properties that is 18 to 35 centimeters thick. The Veridge soils are on backslopes and shoulders and have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 102 centimeters."
