    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bodenburg, Fairless, Koyukuk, Nunaniq, and Toghotthele series in the same family. Bodenburg soils do not have substantial mica content in the control section. Fairless soils do not have thin fine textured lamellae in parts of the solum. Koyukuk have sands and gravel in the substratum. Nunaniq soils are presumed to have warmer soil temperatures. Toghotthele soils have calcium carbonate in the substratum."
