The lower part averages about 5 percent clay and 45 percent rock fragments (sandy-skeletal).\nSoil temperature regime: Cryic (depending on management; O horizons maybe absent, drained and undrained areas may occur and all areas are considered cryic).\nSoil moisture regime: Aquic\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLab data from NSSL, Lincoln, NE:\nThis pedon was not sampled.\nAdditional reference samples are PEDON ID S05ID-081-003-002.\nThe soil has a calcic horizon but is not a Calcic Cryaquoll as the calcic horizon is not within or directly below the mollic epipedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
