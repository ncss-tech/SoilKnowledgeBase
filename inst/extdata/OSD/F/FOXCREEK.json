  "OVERVIEW": "The Foxcreek series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed, stratified alluvium. These soils form on flood plains, drainageways that cross fan remnants, terraces, or valley floors on slopes 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
