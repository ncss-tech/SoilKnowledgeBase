  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates range from 16 to 32 inches.  The thickness of the sandy sediments over the loamy sediments is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper sediment typically does not have rock fragments in the upper part, but it has as much as 8 percent in some pedons.  A lag line as thick as 6 inches and containing as much as 35 percent rock fragments is at the contact of the two sediments in some pedons. The till contains from 1 to 15 percent of rock fragments of mixed lithology.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 21 inches in thickness.  The lower sediment is loamy but with less than 50 percent of fine sand and coarser particles.  Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less begin within depths of 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.   It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon that has the same range in texture as the Bw horizon and range in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe 2BCk and 2C horizon have a matrix with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They have few to many redoximorphic features.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or clay loam.   They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.   Some pedons do not have a 2BCk horizon.\nSome pedons have a 2Bk or 2Bw horizon with the similar range in color and texture as the 2BCk and 2C horizons.\nSome pedons have a C horizon in the sandy sediment.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly has redoximorphic features.  It has the same range in texture as the Bw horizon.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

They formed in 20 to 40 inches of sandy lacustrine sediments over calcareous loamy till or lacustrine sediments.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 27 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 140.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 1600 feet above sea level."

The Flaming soils do not have loamy 2C horizons within depths of 40 inches."
