  "OVERVIEW": "The Forelle series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan aprons, fan piedmonts, hillslopes, and hill toeslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks, primarily shale.  Slopes are typically simple and range from 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and, the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
