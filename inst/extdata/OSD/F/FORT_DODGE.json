  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fort Dodge series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foot slopes, alluvial fans, upland drainageways, treads and risers on stream terraces. These soils formed in loamy colluvium or alluvium overlying coarse textured sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
