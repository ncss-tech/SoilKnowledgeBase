  "OVERVIEW": "The Filiran series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic and metamorphic rocks with an admixture of loess.  The Filiran soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
