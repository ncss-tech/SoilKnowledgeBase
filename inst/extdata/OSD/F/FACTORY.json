  "OVERVIEW": "The Factory series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian materials derived from sandstone.  Factory soils are on pediments, and have slopes of 2 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is 51 degrees F.",

(Bw horizon)\nCalcic horizon - the zone of carbonate accumulation from 15 to 34 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons).\nPetrocalcic horizon - the zone of cementation from 34 to 56 inches. (Bkm horizon)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 34 inches.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nClassification changed from Ustollic Paleorthids to Calcic Petrocalcids in 12/94.\nFurther study of these landscapes may determine the need for intergrades to indurated hardpans similar to those soils that classify as duripans."
