The soils formed in mixed alluvium with some eolian deposition weathered primarily from sandstone.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The freeze-free period is 120 to 160 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 4 inches (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 15 inches. (Bw horizon)\nCalcic horizon - the zone of carbonate accumulation from 15 to 34 inches (Bk1, Bk2, Bk3 horizons).\nPetrocalcic horizon - the zone of cementation from 34 to 56 inches. (Bkm horizon)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 10 to 34 inches.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999.\nClassification changed from Ustollic Paleorthids to Calcic Petrocalcids in 12/94.\nFurther study of these landscapes may determine the need for intergrades to indurated hardpans similar to those soils that classify as duripans.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
