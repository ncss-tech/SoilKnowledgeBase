  "OVERVIEW": "The Faith series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on flood plain steps, drainageways, alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
