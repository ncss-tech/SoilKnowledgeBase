    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Appleriver, Blair, Bunkum, Fishhook, Geff, Glenford, Keene, Muren, Reesville, Sugarvalley, Torox, and Xenia series. Appleriver soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches). Blair and Fishhook soils have rock fragments within the series control section. Bunkum, Geff, and Keene soils have a lithologic discontinuity within a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches). Glenford soils have stratification of textures within the series control section. Muren soils formed in loess on loess hills and have an apparent water table. Reesville, Sugarvalley, Torox, and Xenia soils have carbonates within a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Freeburg soils are on high flood plains and stream terraces along small streams and creeks, and on upland footslopes. Slope gradients are commonly 0 to 4 percent, but range to 9 percent. The soils formed in alluvial sediments washed from loess or till soils of the nearby uplands. Mean annual temperature ranges from 12.2 to 15.0 degrees C (54 to 59 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1,041 millimeters (31 to 41 inches)."

The moderately well drained Lindley and Winfield soils, and the moderately deep Mandeville soils are on adjacent uplands. The fine-textured Chariton soils and the poorly drained Moniteau soils are on similar landscapes. The well drained Nodaway and the poorly drained Westerville soils are on adjacent flood plains."
