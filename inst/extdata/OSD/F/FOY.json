  "OVERVIEW": "The Foy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a mantle of alluvium and colluvium derived from basalt and sedimentary rocks underlain by alluvium and/or weathered residuum from sedimentary bedrock.  Foy soils are on structural benches and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 36 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
