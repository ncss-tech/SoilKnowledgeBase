  "OVERVIEW": "The Foxvire series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Foxvire soils are on concave mountain side slopes (snow pockets).  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
