  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Four Star soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains and narrow canyon bottoms in mountainous areas at elevations of 1,340 to 1,980 meters. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in somewhat stratified ashy alluvium derived from tuffs or ignimbrites with some admixture from rhyolite, basalt, and andesite.  The climate is cool continental.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 5.5 to 7.0 degrees C., and mean summer temperature from 15 to 17 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 400 mm with most of it coming as snow. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buntingville, Bidwell, Holtle, Hovey, and Tica soils and the competing Hussa soils. Buntingville soils have clay loam argillic horizons. Bidwell soils are well drained and have clay loam argillic horizons. Holtle soils are well drained and contain durinodes in a friable matrix. Tica soils have stony and gravelly clay argillic horizons and are 28 to 50 cm deep to bedrock. Hovey soils have clay loam control sections and prominent Ck horizons."

The water table fluctuates at depths less than 46 cm and may be at or near the surface in the very poorly drained areas. Drained phases are recognized."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",

The meadow vegetation is mainly sedge, carex, clover, bentgrass, and redtop with bluegrasses in better drained areas. Coarse sedges and carex grow in the more poorly drained areas."
