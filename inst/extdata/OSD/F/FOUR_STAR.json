  "OVERVIEW": "The Four Star series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils on flood plains and narrow canyon bottoms in mountainous areas. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Four Star soils formed in somewhat stratified ashy alluvium derived from tuffs or ignimbrites with some admixture from rhyolite, basalt, and andesite. The mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm.",

Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in somewhat stratified ashy alluvium derived from tuffs or ignimbrites with some admixture from rhyolite, basalt, and andesite.  The climate is cool continental.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 5.5 to 7.0 degrees C., and mean summer temperature from 15 to 17 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 400 mm with most of it coming as snow. The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

Bidwell soils are well drained and have clay loam argillic horizons. Holtle soils are well drained and contain durinodes in a friable matrix. Tica soils have stony and gravelly clay argillic horizons and are 28 to 50 cm deep to bedrock. Hovey soils have clay loam control sections and prominent Ck horizons."
