Some pedons have carbonates in the lower subsoil or substratum. Bedding plane stratification or lamination is evident within the series control section.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 (6 or more dry), and chroma of 2 or 3.

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid. Areas that have been limed range to neutral.\nThe E horizon, where present, is 8 to 20 cm (3 to 8 in) thick, and has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 (7 or 8 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3.

Some pedons have a BA, E/B or B/E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Some pedons have thin subhorizons of loam or clay loam, or thin lenses of fine sandy loam. Average clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent. Structure is weak to strong, subangular or angular blocky. Some pedons have weak to strong, medium or coarse, prismatic structure, parting to subangular blocky or platy in some pedons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have a thin, very firm, slightly brittle layer in the lower part of the Bt horizon that is not sufficient to meet the requirements for a fragipan horizon.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam or silt clay loam. Some pedons have thin strata of loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam or silty clay, or lenses of very fine and fine sand. Sand content averages 7 to 15 percent. Structure is weak, medium to very coarse, subangular blocky, angular blocky or prismatic; weak or moderate, thin to thick, platy. Rock fragments are commonly absent, but some pedons have up to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is commonly laminated or stratified silt loam or silty clay loam. Sand content averages 7 to 15 percent. Some pedons have thin strata of loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam or silty clay, or lenses of loamy sand, very fine sand, fine sand, and sand within the series control section. Below the series control section may be textures of loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Aptakisic, Caseyville, Creal, Iva, Kendall, Starks, Stronghurst, Waynetown, and Yeddo series. Aptakisic soils have more sand in the lower part of the series control section. Caseyville soils formed in loess and contain less than 7 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Creal soils are more than 61 cm (24 in) to the top of the argillic horizon. Iva soils formed in loess and have a higher mean annual temperature. Kendall soils average more than 15 percent sand at least one subhorizon within a depth of 152 cm (60 in). Starks soils average 15 to 55 percent sand in the lower part of the subsoil. Stronghurst soils lack stratification or lamination within the series control section. Waynetown soils have gravel content greater than 15 percent in the lower solum and substratum. Yeddo soils formed in loess more than 152 cm (60 in) thick and the sand content is less than 10 percent throughout the series control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fitchville soils formed in stratified Wisconsinan age glaciolacustrine sediments that are derived mainly from materials high in sandstone and shale and are on terraces in valleys, on till plains and lake plains Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 830 to 1320 mm (33 to 52 in) and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F)."

The nearby Bogart, Damascus and Jimtown soils formed in loamy outwash deposits and the nearby Canadice and Caneadea soils formed in clayey lacustrine sediments."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Fitchville soils have been cleared. Some of the cleared areas are used for permanent pasture, but most are used for cultivated crops with corn, oats, wheat, soybeans, and mixed hay. Some areas are still wooded. Sugar maple, beech, red oak, pin oak, elm, and hickory are the main tree species. Many areas near cities are in nonagricultural uses."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 in) (Ap and BE horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - from a depth of 25 to 74 cm (10 to 29 in) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\n3. Aquic conditions - from a depth of 18 to 152 cm (7 to 60 in).\nTill substratum phases and clayey lacustrine substratum phases recognized at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in) were mapped in some earlier surveys. These phases do not meet current criteria for substratum phases, and will be evaluated for correlation as new series in future investigations.\nFitchville soils mapped on 6 to 12 percent slopes could possibly be re-correlated to the moderately well drained Glenford soil in future evaluations.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Fitchville series can be found at the NCSS Soil Characterization Database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
