  "OVERVIEW": "The Floer series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, chert, and other rocks with a component of loess.  Floer soils are on mountains and foothills side slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
