    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The major uses are livestock grazing and hay production. The native plant community is a fire-influenced mosaic of tallgrass and midgrass plant communities dominated by little bluestem, other important grasses are Indiangrass, big bluestem, switchgrass, vine mesquite, silver bluestem, tall dropseed, and Texas wintergrass. Improper grazing will result in a reduction of tall grass dominance and an increase in composition of mid-grasses, unpalatable forbs, and woody species. Most areas have been cultivated, eroded and are now in grass."
