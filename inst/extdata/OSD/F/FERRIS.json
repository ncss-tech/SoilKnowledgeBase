  "OVERVIEW": "The Ferris series consists of deep to mudstone, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey residuum weathered from calcareous mudstone. These gently sloping to moderately steep soils occur on backslopes of side slopes of ridges on dissected plains. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C (68 degrees F).",

The native plant community is a fire-influenced mosaic of tallgrass and midgrass plant communities dominated by little bluestem, other important grasses are Indiangrass, big bluestem, switchgrass, vine mesquite, silver bluestem, tall dropseed, and Texas wintergrass. Improper grazing will result in a reduction of tall grass dominance and an increase in composition of mid-grasses, unpalatable forbs, and woody species. Most areas have been cultivated, eroded and are now in grass."
