    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations range from 1,800 to 2,100 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 110 days."
