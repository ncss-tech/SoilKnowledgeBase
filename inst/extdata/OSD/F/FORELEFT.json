  "OVERVIEW": "The Foreleft series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Foreleft soils are on sedimentary plains, fan remnants, hills, ridges, alluvial fans and stream terraces.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.",
