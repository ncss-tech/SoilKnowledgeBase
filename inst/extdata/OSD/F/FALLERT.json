  "OVERVIEW": "The Fallert series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and slope alluvium dominantly from limestone.  Fallert soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 12 percent.  Moderately rapid permeability.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
