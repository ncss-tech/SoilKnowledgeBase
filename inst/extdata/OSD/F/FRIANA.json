Cerro, Pagoda, and Suposo soils are formed in shale parent material. Tomasaki soils are formed in diorite parent material. Tsoodzil soils have hue redder than 7.5YR. The Cerro, Coben, Gerbana, Pagoda, Suposo, Tomaski, and Yankee soils are in LRR-E. The Bearpaw, Gerber, Grail, Mondamin, and Regent soils are in LRR-F. The Burnel, Danvers, Fergus, Reget, Ridgeview, and Wyola soils are in LRR-G. All these soils are more moist in May and June."
