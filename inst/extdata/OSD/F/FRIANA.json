Burnel soils have accumulations of calcium carbonate. Cedarsprings, Coben, and Reget soils have hues 10YR and yellower. Gerbana and Reget soils are moderately deep. Cerro, Pagoda, and Suposo soils are formed in shale parent material. Tomasaki soils are formed in diorite parent material. Tsoodzil soils have hue redder than 7.5YR. The Cerro, Coben, Gerbana, Pagoda, Suposo, Tomaski, and Yankee soils are in LRR-E. The Bearpaw, Gerber, Grail, Mondamin, and Regent soils are in LRR-F. The Burnel, Danvers, Fergus, Reget, Ridgeview, and Savage soils are in LRR-G. All these soils are more moist in May and June."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Friana soils are in nearly level basins.  Elevations range from 6900 to 8000 feet.  They formed in mixed sediments from volcanic ash, cinders and basalt.  The climate is subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 28 inches.  It falls mostly in summer thundershowers and winter snow.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 55 degrees F."
