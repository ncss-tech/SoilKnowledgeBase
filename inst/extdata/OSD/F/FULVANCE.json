  "OVERVIEW": "The Fulvance series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Fulvance soils are on mountain slopes and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
