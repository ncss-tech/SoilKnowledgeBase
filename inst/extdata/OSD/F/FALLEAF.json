  "STATES": "KS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Falleaf series consists of very deep, well drained, soils on summits and back slopes of uplands. Slopes range from 3 to 8 percent slopes. These soils formed in loamy eolian and glacial fluvial material over till. Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters.",

The Falleaf series is expected to be found on the shoulder and side slope positions of interfluves adjacent to the Kansas River. It is normally mapped in an undifferentiated map unit with the Grinter series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: There is currently no NSSL data for the typical pedon.
