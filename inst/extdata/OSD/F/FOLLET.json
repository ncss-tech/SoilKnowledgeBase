Further study of the series is needed to verify classification.\nTypical pedon taxonomic features:\nManner of failure: Slighty fluid, 0 to 10 centimeters (Ag horizon)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 10 centimeters (Ag horizon)\nPeraquic moisture regime: 0 to 200 centimeters (Ag and Cg horizons are permanently saturated)\nSodic properties: SAR above 13 (Ag and Cg horizons)\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 13th Edition (2022)"
