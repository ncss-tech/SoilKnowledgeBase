Some pedons have a peaty or mucky surface 5 to 20 cm (2 to 8 in) thick.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.  The electrical conductivity ranges from 20 to 60 mmhos and the exchangeable sodium percent is more than 15 percent throughout the control section.\nAg horizon:\nHue: N or 10YR\nValue: 3 to 7\nChroma: 2 or less.  Where the value is 3, the thickness is less than 25 cm (10 in).\nTexture: is mainly fine sandy loam through clay loam but ranges to loamy fine sand.\nRedox concentrations: amount-none to common, shades-yellow or brown\nRedox depletions: amount-none to common, shades-gray\nCg horizon:\nHue: N or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 8\nChroma: less than 2\nTexture: loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam, and most pedons are stratified.\nRedox concentrations: amount-none to common, shades-yellow or brown\nRedox depletions: amount-none to common, shades-gray\nIron-manganese concentrations: amount-none to common; kind-masses or nodules\nSome pedons have 2C horizons below 152 cm (60 in) that have the same color range as the A and C horizons, but individual strata are reddish, brownish or yellowish.  Texture ranges from loam to clay and is stratified with more clayey and sandier layers."

Coover et al., in SSSA Proceedings, 1975.\nClassification changed from Typic Haplaquents to Sodic Endoaquents 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  Further study of the series is needed to verify classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 in) (Ag horizon)\nPeraquic moisture regime: water table at or near surface at all times.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data from Brazoria County, TX (S78TX-039-094).\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
