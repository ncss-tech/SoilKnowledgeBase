  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Felda series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy marine deposits. Felda soils are on flatwoods, low broad flats, drainageways, sloughs, depressions, and flood plains. Slopes are linear to concave and range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
