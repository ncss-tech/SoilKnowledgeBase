  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture and reaction are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redox depletions and concentrations are in shades of gray, red, brown, or yellow.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent, and silt content is more than 30 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Btg1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 1 to 8.  Redox depletions and concentrations are in shades of gray, red, brown, or yellow. Texture, clay content, and reaction are similar to the Bt1 horizon. Uncoated sand grains and silt coatings on ped faces are common.\nThe Btg2 horizon is coarsely mottled.  Redox depletions and concentrations are in shades of gray, brown, or yellow.  Texture, clay content, and reaction are similar to the Bt horizon.  Some pedons have silty clay or clay textures below 60 inches.  Streaks and pockets of uncoated sand grains are common.  Silt coatings are present on faces of peds in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Exum and Sawyer series in the same family.  Exum soils do not have uncoated sand grains and silt coatings on ped faces of the Bt horizons.  Sawyer soils have more clayey lower Bt horizons.  In addition, Exum soils have a small amount of plinthite in the lower part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Felker soils are on nearly level or very gently sloping flats of uplands in the Western Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in Quaternary aged loamy alluvium that is high in silt.  Climate is humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 65 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64. Felker soils receive an average total rainfall of 10.2 inches during the months of July through September."

Elysian soils have coarse-loamy control sections, have a base saturation of more than 35 percent, and occur on mounded areas.  Guyton soils have a base saturation of more than 35 percent, and they occur on slightly lower areas.  Kinta soils have clayey control sections and occur on similar areas.  Kullit soils have a coarse-loamy control section and occur on similar areas.  Tomast soils have Bt horizons with dominant chromas of 2 or less and occur on similar areas."
