They formed in clayey sediments that weathered from volcanic rock and limestone.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average annual precipitation range from 40 to 50 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 73 to 77 degrees F."

Aguirre, Cartagena, Fe and Guanica soils are on lower positions, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Santa Isabel soils are on similar positions, but do not have calcium carbonate masses in the subsoil."
