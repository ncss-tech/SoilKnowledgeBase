  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fraternidad series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils on fan skirts of basins and flood plains of the Semiarid Coastal Plains MLRA.  They formed in clayey sediments that weathered from volcanic rock and limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",
