  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fren soils are on ravines.  They typically occur on north-facing backslopes.  These soils formed in volcanic ash over colluvium weathered from basalt.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Elevations range from 3,400 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., average January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F., and average July temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of December 2002 updates the taxonomic class by adding the superactive cation exchange activity class.  Responsibility for the series was transferred from the Reno to Portland MLRA office.  Future study is needed to accurately determine the amount of volcanic glass in this series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 35 inches (A1, A2, 2AB, and 2Bw horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade properties - The zone from the soil surface to 18 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 35 to 65 inches (2Bk1 and 3Bk2 horizons).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 35 to 65 inches (2Bk1 and 3Bk2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (2AB and 2Bw horizons and parts of the A2 and 2Bk1 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
