The C horizon is slightly to very strongly alkaline and has common or many, distinct or prominent mottles.\nThe 2C horizon is multicolored loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, gravelly sand, or gravelly loamy sand and contains 0 to 35 percent gravel by volume.  It is slightly to very strongly alkaline.  Some pedons do not have a 2C horizon."
