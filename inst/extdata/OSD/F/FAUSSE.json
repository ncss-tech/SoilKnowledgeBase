  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches.  COLE ranges from 0.09 to 0.18 in all mineral layers.  The n-value is variable within 36 inches of the soil surface but is 0.7 or less in some subhorizon between 8 and 20 inches.  The n-value of subhorizons below 36 inches is less than 0.7.  Cracks do not form in the upper parts of the subsoil in most years.  Salinity is typically less than 4 dS/m but ranges up to 16 dS/m in subsided areas where saltwater has encroached.\nThe O horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1; or value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2; or it is neutral with value of 4.  Texture is muck or mucky peat.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 4.  Texture is mucky clay or clay.  Where the A horizon has value of 3 it is less than 10 inches thick.  Reaction in the 0 and A horizons ranges from strongly acid to neutral, except in areas where salt water has encroached.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1, or it is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Texture is clay.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown range from none to common.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5BG, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1, or it is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Organic carbon decreases irregularly with depth and is more than 0.2 percent at 50 inches below the soil surface.\nThe C horizon, where present has hue of 5Y to 5BG, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1, or it is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam, with n-value ranging from 0.5 to 1.0.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

Gentilly soils have n-values more than 0.7 in all layers between 8 and 20 inches below the mineral surface.  Schriever soils are on slightly higher or drained positions, have intersecting slickensides within the upper 40 inches, and form cracks."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Fausse series was formerly considered as part of the Swamp clayey miscellaneous land type.  Soil does not crack most years to a depth of 20 inches due to a continuous high water table.  If the water table is lowered to a depth of about 2 feet, Fausse soils may develop characteristics after drainage which would change the classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 11 inches (Oa and A horizon)\nCambic horizon - 11 to 47 inches (Bg1, Bg2 and Bg3 horizons)\nEndosaturation - 0 to 61 inches.  The soil is saturated with water in all layers in most years.\nAquic features - Redoximorphic features; reduction and saturation throughout the pedon in normal years.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
