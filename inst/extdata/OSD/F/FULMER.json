  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 degrees to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 59 degrees to 66 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are saturated throughout for 4 to 5 months during the spring and summer unless drained.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is dominantly medium textured and averages 18 to 27 percent clay, more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand, and less than 15 percent rock fragments.  The profile is calcareous throughout, but there is no calcic horizon that has its upper boundary within 30 inches of the surface.  Many pedons are saline.  The organic matter content decreases regularly with depth and reaches a level of 0.5 percent or less within 50 inches of the surface.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick.  In some untilled pedons a 1- to 30-inch horizon of peat, muck, or mineral soil with much organic matter is at the surface.  The Ap or the upper 10-inch horizon when mixed has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4.5 to 5.5 dry, 2.5 to 3.5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak granular to weak subangular blocky structure.  Faint or distinct mottles with chroma of 2 or less are immediately below the mollic epipedon.  The B and C horizons are moderately or strongly calcareous."

Blackfoot, Fingal, and Parehat soils are not saturated throughout and do not have mottles immediately below the mollic epipedons.  Bowman and McBeth soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section and a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 47 degrees F.  Bowman soils are not calcareous through the 10- to 20-inch layer.  McBeth soils have less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  Fury, Kovich, and Wingville soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 24 inches, and the Fury soils are noncalcareous.  Roliss soils have a calcic horizon at a depth of 30 inches or less.  Tew soils are neutral or mildly alkaline in the lower layers and are noncalcareous below 15 to 30 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches, including 2 to 5 feet of snowfall.  Average freeze-free period is 94 to 126 days."
