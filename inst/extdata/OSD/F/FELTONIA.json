  "OVERVIEW": "The Feltonia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium with loess influence. Feltonia soils formed in fan remnants and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406[cr1] mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",
