    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F.  Mean summer soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Thickness of the solum and volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments and 5 to 18 percent clay.  Some pedons have a thin C horizon under the A horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, with 25 to 50 percent pebbles and 0 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral."

The Buhrig, Devore, Otwin and Venson soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Holloway and Petty soils have 2E&Bt horizons.  Hun soils are loamy sand or coarse sand in the fine earth fraction of the 2C horizon.   The Moses and Prouty soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Myerscreek soils have Cd horizons of dense glacial till and 2 to 6 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Phillcher soils have an average annual soil temperature of 35 to 38 degrees F. and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days.  Surgh soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days, and the acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron is greater than 2.0 percent.  Waldbillig soils have lamellae and a very hard 2E and Bt horizon.  Buttoncreet and Remmel soils are very deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Finney soils are on upper backslopes and shoulders of mountains at elevations of 4,400 to 5,500 feet.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  These soils formed from colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary rock with minor glacial till influence and a mantle of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches.  The mean January temperature is 18 to 22 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 52 to 58 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."
