  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to glacial till range from 10 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the solum has formed in eolian sediments and the lower part of the solum in glacial till.  Few to common rock fragments are in the glacial till.  A thin stone or pebble line is at the contact of the two materials in some pedons.  The mollic epipedon commonly is more than 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It commonly is fine sandy loam, but some is light loam.  Some pedons have up to 6 inches of loamy fine sand in the upper part of the solum.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2BCk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam glacial till.  Some pedons have sandstone or shale below 40 inches."

Bowbells soils lack eolian sediments and have less sand in the upper part of the solum.  Cambern and Chugcreek soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Carfall, Schauson and Todacheene soils do not have carbonates.  Center Creek soils have formed in alluvium, have redoximorphic features beginning at depths of 20 to 40 inches, and have very gravelly 2C horizons.  Detra soils have redder hues.  Gordo soils have hues of redder than 10YR in the Bt horizon.  Hereford soils are at higher elevations in mountainous areas.  Hesperus soils are less alkaline in the B horizon and lack Bk horizons. Jaythree soils receive precipitation mostly during the months of November through March and July through October.  Laceycreek, Ohwiler, Pachel and Peta soils do not have a discontinuity of glacial till at depths of 10 to 40 inches.  In addition, Pachel soils have more than 25 percent rock fragments and Peta soils are saturated at depths of 2 to 4 feet at some time from April through June.  Weed soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for some period immediately following July 1."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Flaxton soils are on nearly level to rolling till plain covered by eolian sediments.  Slopes are concave or convex and gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in eolian sediments and glacial till.  The climate is cool and semiarid with a mean annual temperature ranging from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation of 13 to 17 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lihen, Livona, Parshall and Williams soils. Lihen soils are on nearby uplands where the eolian sediments are thicker. They are sandy.  Livona and Williams soils typically are on convex higher portions of the landscape.  They have thinner mollic epipedons.  Parshall soils are on nearby outwash plains and swales in uplands and are coarse-loamy."
