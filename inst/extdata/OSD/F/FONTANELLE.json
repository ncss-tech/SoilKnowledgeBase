The Rauville soils are frigid. These soils were also mapped as Gibbon Variant soil in Dodge County, Nebraska (MLRA 102C). These soils are highly variable and this classification may not be correct in every situation;  some pedons may be coarse-silty over sandy or sandy skeletal.\nADDITIONAL DATA: None available at this time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
