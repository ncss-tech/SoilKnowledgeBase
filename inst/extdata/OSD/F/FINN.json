  "OVERVIEW": "The Finn series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, alluvial fans, outwash plains, drainageways, depressions and landslides.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
