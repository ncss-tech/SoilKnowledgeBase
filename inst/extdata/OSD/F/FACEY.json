The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from March 20 to November 30 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from April 25 to November 15.  The soil between the depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry for 90 days from mid-July to mid-October in moist years and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick.  The base saturation ranges from 75 to 95 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown, dark brown, dark grayish brown, brown, or grayish brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 5/2).  Moist colors are black, very dark brown, very dark gray, very dark grayish brown or dark brown (10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2).  It is loam with 15 to 20 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent fine (1 to 5mm) gravel.

Gerig soils are underlain by weathered tuff at 20 to 40 inches, have a solum 16 to 24 inches thick and have a component of pyroclastic or ash materials.  Glenrose soils lack a lithic contact, have a dark gray or black A horizon and have a component of loess.

The soils formed in colluvium and materials weathered from metamorphosed sedimentary and igneous rocks of the Klamath Mountains.  Elevations are 2,000 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 18 to 24 inches.   Mean January temperature is 28 to 36 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 64 to 69 degrees F.; mean annual temperature i1s 45 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 80 to 140 days."
