  "OVERVIEW": "The Facey series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from metamorphosed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Facey soils are on uplands and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature ls about 49 degrees F.",

The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from March 20 to November 30 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from April 25 to November 15.  The soil between the depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry for 90 days from mid-July to mid-October in moist years and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick.  The base saturation ranges from 75 to 95 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown, dark brown, dark grayish brown, brown, or grayish brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 5/2).
