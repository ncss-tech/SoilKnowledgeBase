  "OVERVIEW": "The Fanchon series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands. They formed in silty sediments and the underlying colluvium and residuum. These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping ridge tops and shoulder slopes. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
