Cottonbend, McClung, and Trimble soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity. Egyptgrove soils have a Btd horizon.  Nolichucky soils have more sand in the particle size control section. Taterhill soils do not have a 3Bt horizon. Topazmill soils have more than 30 percent sand in the particle size control section.  Wyrick soils typically have more rock fragments in the 2Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fanchon soils are on ridge tops and shoulder slopes. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. These soils formed in silty sediments derived mainly from loess and the underlying colluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary rocks. Elevations are commonly 900 to 1,200 feet. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation varies from 40 to 45 inches."

Alred and Poynor soils have a loamy-skeletal over clayey particle-size class and are on side slopes. Bendavis soils are moderately deep and on sides slopes. Scholten and Tonti soils have fragipans. Scholten soils are skeletal and on shoulder slopes. Tonti soils are adjacent to Fanchon soils on ridge tops."
