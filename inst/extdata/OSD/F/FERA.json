  "OVERVIEW": "The Fera series consists of deep well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from conglomerate and shale. Fera soils are on mountain sideslopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
