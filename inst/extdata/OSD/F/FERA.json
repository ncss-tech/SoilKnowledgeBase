These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from conglomerates and shale.  The climate is cool semiarid continental with an average annual precipitation of 200 to 300 mm that comes mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 50 to 100 days."
