  "OVERVIEW": "The Fourwheel series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Fourwheel soils are on rock pediments, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 3 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 3 to 40 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
