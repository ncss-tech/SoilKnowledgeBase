  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fourwheel soils are on rock pediments, hills, and mountains.  They typically occur on summit positions.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 3 to 40 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 6,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of December 2004 updates the taxonomic class from Fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Paleargids based on lack of vertic features in the typical pedon and calculated linear extensibility for the typical pedon that is less than 6.0 centimeters between the soil surface and the lithic contact.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nPaleargids great group feature - The abrupt clay content increase of more than 15 percent at 7 inches (between the A2 and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 7 to 22 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 22 inches to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (2R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 7 to 22 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
