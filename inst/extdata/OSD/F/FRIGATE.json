  "OVERVIEW": "The Frigate series consists of moderately deep to soft bedrock, well drained soils that formed in materials weathered schist. Frigate soils are on northerly side slopes of hills. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F (14 degrees C.)",
