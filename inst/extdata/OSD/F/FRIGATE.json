The difference in soil temperature between mean summer and mean winter is less than 6 degrees C. The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about mid-September to mid-November (about 90 days) and is usually moist the rest of the time.\nDepth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches (50 to 100 centimeters).\nThe particle size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nReaction is slightly acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR or 7.5YR 4/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, or 6/3 dry.
