The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line in North Carolina and Virginia necessitated the establishment of the Fairview series as a mesic counterpart.  The 2008 revision is intended to limit the amount of mica allowed in the Fairview series.  Fairview is not intended to replace Madison soils in the mesic region.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 9 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 9 to 24 inches (Bt horizon)\nKandic horizon--the zone from 9 to 29 inches (Bt & BC horizons).\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: No laboratory data available.\nDatabase Information:\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID82665\nUser Pedon ID--88NC171001\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSlope Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip Elevation\n2-60  52-57   160-205   40-55  300-1400\nSOI-5  FloodL  FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNONE           >6.0                      >60\nSOI-5  Depth   Texture            3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\n0-9     SL FSL L           0-10    75-100  8-20    4-10\n0-9     SCL CL             0-10    75-100 20-35    2-10\n9-24    SC CL C            0-10    55-100 35-60    2-12\n24-60   SL FSL L SCL CL    0-10    55-100 10-30    1-10\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
