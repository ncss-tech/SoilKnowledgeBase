  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and 30 to 60 percent fine sand or coarser.  Rock fragments commonly are less than 15 percent but range to 30 percent in some pedons and are mainly angular sandstone gravel.  In some pedons the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR.\nThe Btk horizon has the same range as the Bt horizon except it has visible accumulations of calcium carbonate and is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 15 percent."

Bond and Bondman soils do not have a horizon of calcium carbonate accumulation and are typically noneffervescent throughout.  Kech soils have mean annual soil temperatures of more than 50 degrees F."
