  "OVERVIEW": "The Filiorum series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from calcareous shale. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent and are on nearly level to moderately sloping marine terraces. The mean annual precipitation is about 340 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C.",
