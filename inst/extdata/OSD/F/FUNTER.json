  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to mineral soil ranges from 24 to 63 inches.  Depth to water table ranges from the surface to 10 inches. The soils may be interlayered with thin strata of hemic or sapric material, or mineral soil.  Reaction of the profile ranges from extremely acid to medium acid. The pH (0.01 M Calcium Chloride) is 4.5 or more in at least some part of the organic materials in the control section.\nThe surface tier has hue from 5YR to 2.5Y, value moist from 2 to 6, and chroma moist from 2 to 5.  Rubbed and pressed colors may vary by an increase or decrease of one unit in value or chroma.  Fiber content ranges from 90 to 100 percent unrubbed, 75 to 90 percent rubbed.  The organic material is primarily slightly decomposed sphagnum moss, along with sedges and equisetum stems.\nThe subsurface tier has a hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY, value moist of 3 to 7, and chroma moist of 4 or less.  Rubbed and pressed colors may vary by an increase or decrease of one unit in value or chroma.  Fiber content ranges from 85 to 100 percent unrubbed, 75 to 95 percent rubbed.  The organic material is primarily slightly decomposed coarse sphagnum moss, along with sedges, and equisetum stems.\nTexture of the 2C horizon is silt, silt loam, or sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 30 percent, with 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent gravel."

The soils formed in fibrous peat underlain by loamy mineral material.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 1000 feet.  The climate is humid maritime with the average annual precipitation ranging from 21 to 100 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F."

Ashmun, Chilkoot, Hollow, Skagway and Tsirku soils occur on floodplains and are developed in sand and gravel alluvium.  Lutak soils occur on terraces, have spodic horizons, and are shallow over sand and gravel."
