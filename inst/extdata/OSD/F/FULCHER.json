    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 40 degrees F.  and mean summer soil temperature is 54 degrees F.  The solum ranges from 20 to more than 50 inches thick.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate accumulation range from 17 to 50 inches.  The soils range from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  The argillic horizon averages 10 to 35 percent fine or coarser sand and 35 to 60 percent clay.  Rock fragments in the solum and C horizons above a depth of 40 inches range from 0 to 35 percent.  Hue ranges from 5Y through 7.5YR except some pedons have thin subhorizons with hue redder than 7.5YR.  The lower part of the 10 to 40 inch section is loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam, and has 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 50 percent coarser than very fine sand."

Burnette soils have silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay C horizons that contain less than 50 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Friana and Kutum soila are noncalcareous throughout.  Luna and Mayflower soils have a paralithic contact at some point between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Paulson soils have 5YR or redder hue in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed in thick, calcareous, medium to moderately fine textured parent materials weathered primarily from rhyolite, andesite, and trachite.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.  and mean summer temperature is 55 degrees F."
