  "OVERVIEW": "The Forgay series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium weathered from mixed rock sources.  Forgay soils are on alluvial fans and stream terrraces.  Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 48 degrees to 52 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is about 63 degrees to 65 degrees F. and the mean winter temperature is about 32 degrees to 34 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section, (13 to 53 inches), is moist in all parts from about December 1 to May 15.  It is dry in all parts from about July 15 to September 15.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from about April 15 to November 15 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from about May 15 to November 1.  Most undisturbed pedons have a surface litter decomposing pine needles and twigs about one inch thick.  The reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout. The 10 to 40 inch control section weighted average texture is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam with 40 to 80 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/2, 5/2, 5/3,or 4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 3/3, or 3/2.  Where value is 4 or 5 dry and 3 moist and chroma is 2 dry and 2 or 3 moist, the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam, or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel, range from 35 to 75 percent.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/4, or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/4, or 3/3.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly coarse sandy loam, extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand or extremely gravelly coarse sandy loam.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel, range from 40 to 80 percent."
