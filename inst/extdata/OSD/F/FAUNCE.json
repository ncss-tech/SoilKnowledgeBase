  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to free calcium carbonate range from 11 to 35 inches.  The rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A and E horizons.  The rock fragment content in the control section averages between 10 and 35 percent, but some subhorizons have less than 10 percent.  Rock fragments are commonly mixed in lithology and are mostly less than 3 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.   The A and E horizons are loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.  They are strongly acid to slightly acid.  Some pedons have a thin O horizon.\nThe Bt horizon consists of one or more thin (combined thickness less than 3 inches) bands with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sandy loam, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, loamy coarse sand, sandy clay loam, or their gravelly analogues.  It is neutral or slightly acid.  It commonly has 2 to 4 times as much clay as the adjacent E material.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons have 2 chroma below 40 inches.  It is sand, coarse sand, fine sand, or their gravelly analogues.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is neutral in upper part of some pedons."

Andrusia and Sugarbush soils have argillic horizons more than 6 inches thick.  The Hiwood and Redby soils do not have rock fragments and occupy slightly lower positions.  Corliss soils do not have lamellae that meet the requirements for an argillic horizon except thickness.  Cormant soils occupy low lying beaches and depressions."
