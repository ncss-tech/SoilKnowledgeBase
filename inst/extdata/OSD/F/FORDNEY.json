  "OVERVIEW": "The Fordney series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks with an influence of volcanic ash.  Fordney soils are on lake terraces, stream terraces, and fan remnants.   Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Elevations range from 1,234 to 1,707 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 356 mm.  The mean January temperature is about -2 degrees C., the mean July temperature is about 19 degrees C., and the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9.5 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 120 days."

Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent."
