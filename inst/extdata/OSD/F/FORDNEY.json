  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - The soil is usually moist at depths between 30 to 89 cm in winter and spring, dry in summer and fall; dry about 80 to 120 days in the four month period following the summer solstice; Aridic (torric) moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature - 9 to 11.5 degrees C.\nMollic epipedon thickness - 25 to 50 cm.\nDepth to bedrock - More than 152 cm.\nReaction - Neutral through moderately alkaline.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 5 to 15 percent;\nRock fragments: 0 to 5 percent gravel.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as tuff, basalt, and andesite.\nOther features - Mineralogy is mixed and includes a high percentage of dark, (mafic) minerals such as hornblende.\nA horizon\nValue: 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry.\nChroma: 1 or 2 dry.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent; decreases to a level less than 1 percent at some depth between 10 to 20 inches and color value dark enough for a mollic epipedon at depths below 20 inches results largely from uncoated sand grains.\nC horizons\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y.\nValue: 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry.\nChroma: 2 or 3, moist or dry.\nTexture: Loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sand.\nRock fragments: 0 to 5 percent fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter).\nOrganic matter content: 0.5 to 2 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Graufels and Mottsville series.\nGraufels soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Mottsville soils have high amounts of coarse sand and very coarse sand and average 5 to 30 percent granitic rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fordney soils are on lake terraces, stream terraces, and fan remnants.  These soils formed in alluvium or lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks such as tuff, basalt, and andesite with an influence of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 1,234 to 1,707 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 356 mm.  The mean January temperature is about -2 degrees C., the mean July temperature is about 19 degrees C., and the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9.5 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 120 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Laki soils are fine-loamy, calcareous, and moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Poe soils are moderately deep to duripans and are calcareous."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Excessively drained; very low or low surface runoff; moderately rapid permeability (high saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Over-irrigation can produce a high water table in nearly level areas.  Endosaturation is present in these phases with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2 and 6 feet (moderately deep or deep free water occurrence classes) between March and September.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Fordney soils are used mainly for irrigated crops, livestock grazing, and homesite development.  The vegetation in rangeland is mainly antelope bitterbrush, basin big sagebrush, Thurber's needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and bluebunch wheatgrass."
