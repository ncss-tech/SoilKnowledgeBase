  "OVERVIEW": "The Farrell series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits that have a mantle of loess.  These soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

These soils are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches more than half of the time when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F (about 105 to 120 days).  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 14 to 41 inches.  The particle-size control section is 0 to 10 percent rock fragments. Depth to the 2C horizon is 40 to more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has 0 to 5 percent pebbles.  It is very bouldery in some pedons.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It has 0 to 5 percent gravel.  This horizon has subangular blocky or weak prismatic structure.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5, 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is loamy coarse sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It is stratified in some pedons.  It is 0 to 10 percent rock fragments with 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.

Blickenstaff soils have 15 to 25 percent rock fragments in parts of the control section.  Blue Star and Courtrock soils lack a cambic B horizon and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in parts of the control section.  Malott soils have dense glacial till in the lower part and more than 10 percent rock fragments in some part of the particle-size control section.  Tickason soils have a calcic horizon. Tonasket soils are dominantly silt loam throughout the control section and have laminations in the 2C horizon."

The soils formed in glaciofluvial material consisting of basaltic and granitic materials, with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The climate is semiarid having warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches.  Average January temperature is 30 degrees F, average July temperature is 72 degrees F, average annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 135 to 180 days."

In addition, Magallon soils are sandy.  Peshastin soils are loamy-skeletal.  Quincy soils are sandy and have an ochric epipedon.  Ritzcal and Ritzville soils are coarse-silty.  Soaplake and Starbuck soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches."
