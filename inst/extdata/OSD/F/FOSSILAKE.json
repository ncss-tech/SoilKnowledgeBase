  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fossilake soils are on depressions on lakebeds. These soils formed in eolian material and lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Elevations range from 1,306 to 1,326 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Salhouse and Thornlake soils. Salhouse soils have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section, do not have endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface, and are on stable dunes. Thornlake soils are ashy, have cambic horizons, do not have endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface, and occur on lake terraces."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained; negligible surface runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity. Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table within 76 cm of the soil surface (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from April through June. Cumulative annual duration class is Transitory. The water table drops after June, but remains within about 122 cm of the soil surface year-round. These soils are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration from February through June with water less than 15 cm deep."
