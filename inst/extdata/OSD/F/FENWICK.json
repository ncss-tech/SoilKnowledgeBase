  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock are 20 to 40 inches.  Sandstone fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the A, AB, BA, and Bt horizons and from 5 to 35 percent in the BC and C horizons.  Fragments are commonly of channer and flagstone size.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through neutral in the A horizons and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the Bt, BC, and C horizons.\nThe A and AB horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon, 0 to 6 inches thick, with hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.  Consistence is friable.\nThe Bt horizon has matrix hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The lower part has red, brown, and gray mottles.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable in the upper part and friable to firm in the lower part.\nMost pedons have a BC horizon with color and texture similar to the Bt horizon.  Structure is weak subangular blocky or platy.  Consistence is firm or very firm.  Part of the BC horizon may have brittle characteristics.\nMany pedons have a C horizon that has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. Consistence is firm or very firm."

The Cookport series in a related family.  Adelphia and Holmdel soils contain glauconite.  Blairton soils have up to 70 percent shale fragments in the lower part of the solum.  Cana soils are silty and developed in loess.  Bedrock under Brumbaugh, Cookport, Cotaco, Delanco, Tuscarawas, Wharton, and Woodstown soils is at depths greater than 40 inches. Cookport soils have a fragipan.  Dillard soils contain a noticeable amount of mica and have gray clay or clay loam 2B horizons. Mattapex soils formed in coastal plains material and do not have rock fragments in the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fenwick soils are on broad ridgetops and benches on sandstone-capped mountains.  Slope is dominantly 3 to 8 percent but ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Fenwick soils formed in acid material weathered from acid sandstone or interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 52 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F."

Buchanan soils have a fragipan and are at lower positions on the landscape.  Clymer, Dekalb, Gilpin, Lily, and Rayne soils are well drained and are generally at higher positions on the landscape.  Cedarcreek and Kaymine soils are formed in regolith from the surface mining of coal."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were previously mapped as Variants of the Cookport series.  In West Virginia, they are associated with the Kanawha and New River Formations of the Pottsville group.  It is not clear whether these soils formed in sandstone residuum or from extremely old sediments deposited on the sandstone.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A and AB horizons).\n2.  Argillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 25 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\n3.  Aquic feature - the zone from 18 to 25 inches (Bt2 horizon).\nThe 10/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). CEC class is based on NASIS data from Webster County, West Virginia. Competing series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
