  "OVERVIEW": "The Fayal series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and underlying fine, dense till. They are on till plains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow. Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",
