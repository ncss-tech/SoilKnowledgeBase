  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fayal soils are on concave to linear surfaces of till plains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. They formed in a thin mantle of loess and underlying fine, dense glacial till deposited by the St. Louis sublobe of late Wisconsin age. Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches. The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days. Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1600 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Buhl, Daisybay, Dora, Hibbing, McQuade and Rifle soils. The moderately well drained Hibbing, somewhat poorly drained Buhl and poorly drained McQuade soils form a hydrosequence with Fayal soils. The very poorly drained Daisybay and Dora soils formed in organic materials over till. The very poorly drained Rifle soils occur in depressions and formed in organic materials."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow. The Fayal soils have seasonal high saturation at the surface for some time between April through June and October through November in years of normal precipitation."
