LaDelle and Neche soils are fine-silty.  In addition, LaDelle soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and Neche soils have redoximorphic concentrations within depths of 20 inches. Lamoure soils are fine-silty.  Ludden and Wahpeton soils are fine.  In addition, Lamoure and Ludden soils are poorly drained.  In addition, Wahpeton have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.          La Prairie soils have mollic epipedons more than 30 inches thick."
