  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fairdale soils are on low terraces and flood plains.  Slope gradients are mainly less than 1 percent, but range to 15 percent along channels and edges of terraces.  The soils formed in stratified, loamy recent alluvium.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 15 to 25 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer.  Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 2350 feet."

All of these soils except Wahpeton soils are on low terraces and floodplains. Wahpeton soils are on higher levees.  Cashel soils are fine and somewhat poorly drained.  LaDelle and Neche soils are fine-silty.  In addition, LaDelle soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and Neche soils have redoximorphic concentrations within depths of 20 inches. Lamoure soils are fine-silty.  Ludden and Wahpeton soils are fine.  In addition, Lamoure and Ludden soils are poorly drained.  In addition, Wahpeton have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick.          La Prairie soils have mollic epipedons more than 30 inches thick."

These soils have rare or common flooding early in the spring when the snow melts, and during severe summer storms.  A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 3 to 5 feet at some time during the period of April through June."
