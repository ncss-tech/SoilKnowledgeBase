  "BYREV": "Rev. GAP-RAL-TWN",
  "REVDATE": "01/2015",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Frontenac series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy sediments over loamy-skeletal residuum and/or colluvium primarily from limestone. These soils are on slightly convex to slightly concave northwest-facing to southeast-facing slopes on the upper part of foot slopes and the middle and upper parts of valley slopes in dissected terrain. Slope ranges from 15 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
