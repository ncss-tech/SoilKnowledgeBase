  "OVERVIEW": "The Fortwingate series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from Chinle sandstone and shale overlying San Andreas limestone. Fortwingate soils are on uplands, cuestas, hogbacks, hills and ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
