  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,783 to 2,621 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 350 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
