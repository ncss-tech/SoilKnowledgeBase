  "OVERVIEW": "The Fricaba series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes and glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 100 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 140 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention is 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and 6 or 8 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial loam, or extremely cobbly medial sandy loam.  The reaction is strongly or very strongly acid.
