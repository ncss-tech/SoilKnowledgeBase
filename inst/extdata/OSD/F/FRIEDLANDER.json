  "OVERVIEW": "The Friedlander series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed mostly in residuum and some colluvium from granitic rocks, with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  These soils are on backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
