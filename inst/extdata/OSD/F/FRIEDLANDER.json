These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The volcanic ash mantle ranges from 7 to 14 inches in thickness  and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.0 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.   The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 2 to 15 percent granitic rock fragments.  These soils have an E, E/B or B/E or any combination of these horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  This horizon is 0 to 5 percent pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  This horizon is 0 to 5 percent pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma o 2 through 4 dry or moist.  This horizon is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Some pedons lack a 2E horizon.\nThe E part of the 2E/Bt horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  The Bt part has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  The E part is loam or very fine sandy loam and the horizon is gravelly in some pedons.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium, angular blocky or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is 0 to 10 percent pebbles. Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.  Some pedons lack a 2E/B horizon.\nThe Bt part of the 2Bt/E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  The E part has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam. This horizon has moderate or strong, medium or coarse, angular blocky or subangular blocky structure.   It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Some pedons lack a 2Bt/E horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  It is clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam and may be gravelly.  It has moderate or strong, medium or coarse, prismatic, angular blocky, or subangular blocky structure.  It is 5 to 10 percent pebbles.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Friedlander soils are on backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes of mountains.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rocks with a thin mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. Elevations range from 2,400 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Canteen and Dinkelman soils are less than 60 inches deep and coarse loamy.  Centralpeak and Spokane soils are coarse-loamy and 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Georgecreek soils are fine-loamy and have a mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches of 47 to 52 degrees F. Sclome soils have an aquic soil moisture regime."

Base saturation is assumed to be less than 75 percent (by sum) throughout the argillic horizon.
