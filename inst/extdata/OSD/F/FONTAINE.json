  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral throughout.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in sandy strata in the A and B horizons and 0 to 25 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Generally, it is stratified with textures of silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, with thinner strata of loamy fine sand to sand; but thin strata may also have texture of fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Iron accumulations or depletions are in shades of gray, brown or red.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2, except in thin sandy strata that may range to chroma of 4.  Generally, it is stratified with textures of silt loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam, with thinner strata of loamy fine sand to sand.  Iron accumulatios and depletions are in shades of gray, brown or red.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Iron and manganese accumulation and depletions range from none to common and are in shades of gray, brown or red.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is highly variable ranging from silt to coarse sand and their gravelly analogs.  Any texture may have a gravelly modifiers, but they are generally associated with the sandy textures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fontaine soils occur mainly on the west side of Crowley's Ridge in Arkansas and possibly southern Missouri.  These soils formed in sediments eroded from loess and the underlying Tertiary sand and gravel deposits, which makeup Crowley's Ridge.  These soils occur on alluvial fans and along abandoned drains for short distances on terraces adjacent to the ridge.  No flooded phases are currently recognized."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Brandon, Calhoun, Calloway, Oaklimeter, Loring and Saffell series. Brandon soils are well drained, in a fine-silty particle size class and occur on adjacent upland ridges and side slopes.  Calhoun soils are poorly drained, in a fine-silty particle size class and occur on adjacent terrace positions.  Calloway soils are somewhat poorly drained, in a fine-silty particle size class and occur on adjacent terrace positions.  Oaklimeter soils are in a coarse-silty particle size class and occur along active drains.   Loring soils are in a fine-silty particle size class and occur on upland ridgetops.  Saffell soils are well drained, in a loamy-skeletal particle size class and occur on adjacent upland side slopes."
