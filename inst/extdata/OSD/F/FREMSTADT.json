Volume of rock fragements range from 3 to 30 percent as a weighted average throught.  Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 25 percent throughout.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  In cultivated areas, the Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an Oe or Oa horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 2.5, and chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 3 to 6.
