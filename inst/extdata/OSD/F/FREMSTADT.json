  "OVERVIEW": "The Fremstadt series consists of very deep well drained soils.  These soils formed mostly in sandy till or sandy mudflow sediment on disintegration moraines. Permeability is moderately rapid and rapid in the solum and moderately rapid in the substratum.  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
