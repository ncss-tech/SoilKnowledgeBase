  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent in the solum and from 10 to 40 percent in the substratum. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper part of the solum, very strongly acid to moderately acid in the BC horizon, and strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nSome pedons have thin Oe and/or Oa horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine earth fraction is dominantly loamy sand, but includes loamy fine sand and sandy loam. Structure is weak granular. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction is dominantly loamy sand, but includes loamy fine sand and fine sand. Structure is weak granular or the horizon is single grain. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is dominantly loamy sand, however thin subhorizons of loamy fine sand or sandy loam are in some pedons. Structure is weak, fine to coarse granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is dominantly loamy sand, but also includes loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand. Structure is weak, fine or medium subangular blocky, or the horizon is single grain.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction is dominantly loamy sand, but also includes loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand. Some pedons have thin subhorizons of sandy loam below 40 inches. The horizon is massive or single grain. Some pedons have thin layers below 40 inches (being less than 20 inches total thickness), of weak platy structure. Consistence is friable to loose, and may be firm in place."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Missisquoi series is the only other member of this family. Missisquoi soils are dominantly coarse sand in the substratum.\nThe Deerton, Duel, East Lake, Hartwick, Ishpeming, Karlin, Kiva, Pence, Rousseau, Rubicon, Sayner, and Vilas soils are in a similar family. These soils are all from outside of Region R, and all have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fernlake soils are on till uplands. Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent. They are usually on undulating plains and on sideslopes of low hills and ridges. The parent material is glacial drift derived from sandstone and granitic rock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 50 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and the mean frost free season ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 500 to 2000 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adams, Adirondack, Monadnock, Colton, Hermon, and Sunapee soils. Adams and Colton soils are on lower positions on valley sides and terraces. Adams soils have better expressed spodic horizons and generally have fewer rock fragments in the upper solum. Colton soils average greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Monadnock and Hermon soils are on similar landscapes, but Monadnock soils have less sand and Hermon soils have more rock fragments. The somewhat poorly drained Adirondack soils and the moderately well drained Sunapee soils are on adjacent concave areas and drainageways."

Albic horizon - the zone from 2 to 3 inches (E horizon).\nb. Spodic horizon - the zone from 3 to 17 inches (Bs1, Bs2 and Bs3 horizons.)\nc. Sandy particle-size class - loamy sand textures throughout the particle-size control section (10 to 40 inches).\nSoil Interpretation Records: NY0451, NY0452\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
