  "OVERVIEW": "The Firada series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, or materials derived mainly from limestone.  These soils are on mountainsides and uplands.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 4 inches (E horizon); a cambic horizon from 4 to 18 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons); a particle-size control section from 10 inches to the lithic contact; a horizon of carbonate accumulation from 18 to 26 inches (Bk horizon); and a lithic contact at 26 inches (R horizon).  Firada soils have a udic moisture regime and a cryic temperature regime.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Typic Eutrocryepts to Loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive Calcic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
