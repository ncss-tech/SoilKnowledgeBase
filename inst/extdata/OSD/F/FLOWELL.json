  "OVERVIEW": "The Flowell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous rocks and quartzite.  The Flowell soils are on hills, alluvial fans and terraces.  Slope ranges from 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: The zone from the 0 to 10 inches. (A and Bt1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: The zone from 4 to 24 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 24 to 60 inches. (Ck horizons)\nThe Ck horizon designation is derived from the original Cca designation from the early 1970's.  Field work is needed to establish the presence of secondary carbonates.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\".  The type location was moved from Millard county to Beaver county in February 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
