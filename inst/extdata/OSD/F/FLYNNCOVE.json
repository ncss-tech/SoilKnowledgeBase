  "OVERVIEW": "The Flynncove series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite rocks.  Flynncove soils are on fan remnants and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
