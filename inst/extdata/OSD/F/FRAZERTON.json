The control section is dominantly silty clay loam or silty clay and includes thin strata of loam, clay loam, and clay 4 to 8 inches thick. Salinity ranges from 2 to 4 mmhos.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10R, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10R, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry. It is primarily stratified silty clay loam or silty clay but includes thin layers of loam, clay loam, and clay. This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline."
