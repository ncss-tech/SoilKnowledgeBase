  "OVERVIEW": "The Felix series consists of deep and very deep, somewhat poor and poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Felix soils are in upland basins, playas and depressions.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
