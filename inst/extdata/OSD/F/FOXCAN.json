  "OVERVIEW": "The Foxcan series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from shale with additions of eolian material.  The Foxcan soils are on mountain back slopes.  Slopes are 50 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
