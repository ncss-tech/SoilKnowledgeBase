  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Frydek series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial deposits derived from igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock of the Beaumont Formation.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are in open depressions on coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm (50 in).",
