  "OVERVIEW": "The Footstep series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Footstep soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is approximately 2060 millimeters (80 inches) and the mean annual temperature is approximately 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
