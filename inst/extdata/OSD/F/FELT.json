Of the geographically associated soils, Feltonia soils are found on the highest positions on fan remnants and stream terraces. Feltonia soils have a coarse-loamy particle size class. Arimo and Altaby soils are found in slightly lower positions on fan remnants than Feltonia soils and have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle size class. Alpine soils are in concave swales on fan remnants, have a loamy-skeletal particle size class, and have carbonatic mineralogy."
