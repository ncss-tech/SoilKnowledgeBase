    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam or loam. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent. It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is dominantly clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam, but ranges to silty clay loam or silt loam where the silty material is at the maximum thickness. The upper part of the Bt horizon is strongly acid to neutral. The lower part of the Bt horizon has similar hue and value to the upper part but ranges to chroma 2 and is clay loam, loam or sandy clay loam.  The lower part of the Bt horizon is medium acid to neutral.  Gravel content of the Bt horizon ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is dominantly silt loam or loam but strata coarser than sandy loam are in all pedons. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 12 percent. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Till substratum phases are recognized for pedons underlain by glacial till."

Atkinson, Calmar, and Hitt have the lower part of the solum formed in limestone residuum. Barce soils have the lower part of the solum formed in till. Burchard soils have a thinner sola and are less acid. Corwin, Cresco, Griswold, Parr, Ringwood, Shelby, and Velma soils do not have stratification in the solum and C horizon.  Durand, Joslin, Morrill, Pana, and Winnebago soils have hue redder than 10YR in the B horizon. Friesland soils have more silt and less sand in the lower part of the solum and the C horizon.  Hochheim, La Rose, Markesan, and Rotamer soils have sola less than 24 inches thick. Jasper soils do not have gray mottles in the subsoil. Linkville soils have more coarse sand, very coarse sand and gravel in the lower part of the solum. Moingona soils formed in colluvial and alluvial sediments on foot slopes and alluvial fans. Mona and Symerton soils have more clay and less sand in the lower part of the solum. Plattville soils have hue redder than 10YR in the Bt horizon and are underlain by limestone bedrock at depths from 40 to 60 inches. Prairieville soils do not have carbonates above a depth of 60 inches and have the lower part of the solum formed in a pale soil in Illinois till.  Schoolcraft, Tippecanoe, and Wea soils contain more gravel in the lower part of the solum. Sibleyville soils are underlain by sandstone or shale at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Foresman soils formed in loamy outwash or in as much as 20 inches of silty material and the underlying outwash. Mean annual temperature ranges from 49 degrees to 52 degrees F.  and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 37 inches."

The moderately well drained Corwin soils are not stratified, formed in till and are on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Darroch soils are grayer in the upper part of the solum and are on slightly lower lying landscape positions. The poorly drained Drummer, Pella and Selma soils are grayer in the solum and are in depressions. The well drained Jasper soils are not mottled and are on nearby slopes and rises."
