  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments, mainly channers and flagstones, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the solum, and from 15 to 70 percent in the substratum, if it is present. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the soil.\nThe Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have a thin, dark, A horizon from 1 to 4 inches thick.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is fine or medium angular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is angular or subangular blocky or prismatic. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe BC horizon has color and texture similar to the Bt horizon.\nA C horizon is present in some pedons, and is similar to the BC horizon in fine earth texture and color.  It is massive or has plate like rock controlled structure.\nThe R horizon is horizontal bedded shale, siltstone or fine-grained sandstone.  It can be interbedded."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Blairton, Cavode, Kanona, Hornell and Dolph soils are similar but in related families.  The Blairton series is the mesic equivalent of Frewsburg. Cavode, Kanona and Hornell soils have a fine particle-size control section. Dolph soils formed in loess underlain with clayey residuum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Frewsburg soils are on upland divides, broad ridge tops, footslopes, and moderately low benches. Slopes are dominantly between 2 and 8 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The Frewsburg soils formed in residuum derived from interbedded shale, siltstone and fine grained sandstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and the growing season ranges from 90 to 120 days. These soils are mostly at elevations of 1,900 to 2,400 feet."

The Brinkerton, Ernest, Rayne, Wharton, Valois, Chautauqua, Schuyler, Kinzua and Onoville soils are on associated landscapes.  Brinkerton and Ernest soils have fragipans and are in a mesic temperature regime; Rayne, Wharton, Kinzua and Onoville soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock; Valois, Chautauqua and Schuyler soils formed in glacial till at lower elevations in mesic regions."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most open areas are used to grow corn, hay and small grain crops in support of dairy farms.  Forested areas have native mixed hardwoods of red and white oak, sugar maple, beech, hemlock and white pine. Many areas that were formerly cleared for crop production are now idle and reverting to brush and trees."

Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 17 inches (Ap and BE horizons).\nb. Aquic moisture regime - evidenced by low chroma ped faces and redoximorphic features in the BE horizon.\nc. Aeric subgroup - evidenced by 40 percent or more high chroma matrix in the BE horizon.\nd. Argillic horizon - the zone from 17 to 25 inches (Bt horizon).\ne. Lithic contact - bedrock at 38 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data for the typical pedon is available from the Cornell Soil Survey Laboratory, pedon number S83NY013-13.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
