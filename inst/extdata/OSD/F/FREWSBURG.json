  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "WEH-PSP-ART",
  "REVDATE": "02/2002",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Frewsburg series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in weathered residuum from interbedded acid siltstone, shale and sandstone.  They are on bedrock controlled benches on upland divides and broad hill tops.  Permeability is moderate in the surface layer and moderate to moderately slow in the in the subsoil and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments, mainly channers and flagstones, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the solum, and from 15 to 70 percent in the substratum, if it is present. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the soil.\nThe Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have a thin, dark, A horizon from 1 to 4 inches thick.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is fine or medium angular or subangular blocky.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is angular or subangular blocky or prismatic. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe BC horizon has color and texture similar to the Bt horizon.\nA C horizon is present in some pedons, and is similar to the BC horizon in fine earth texture and color.  It is massive or has plate like rock controlled structure.\nThe R horizon is horizontal bedded shale, siltstone or fine-grained sandstone.  It can be interbedded."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Frewsburg soils are on upland divides, broad ridge tops, footslopes, and moderately low benches. Slopes are dominantly between 2 and 8 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The Frewsburg soils formed in residuum derived from interbedded shale, siltstone and fine grained sandstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, and the growing season ranges from 90 to 120 days. These soils are mostly at elevations of 1,900 to 2,400 feet."

The Brinkerton, Ernest, Rayne, Wharton, Valois, Chautauqua, Schuyler, Kinzua and Onoville soils are on associated landscapes.  Brinkerton and Ernest soils have fragipans and are in a mesic temperature regime; Rayne, Wharton, Kinzua and Onoville soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock; Valois, Chautauqua and Schuyler soils formed in glacial till at lower elevations in mesic regions."
