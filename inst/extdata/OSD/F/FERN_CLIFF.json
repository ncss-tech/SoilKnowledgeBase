    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 01, 02, and A1 horizons are absent to some pedons.  Thickness of solum exceeds 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium is usually less than 3 percent and does not exceed 14 percent in any part of the solum.  The soil is 60 to 100 percent base saturated.  Rock fragments in the solum range from 0 to 35 percent and tend to increase with increasing depth.  These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 150 days (cumulative) in most years and the whole soil is dry for periods of 10 to 30 days at some time nearly every year.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 50 to 58 degrees F. in soils with an O horizon at least 4 inches thick.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is usually platy but has granular or subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft to slightly hard and has high mica content.  It is strongly acid to mildly alkaline (pH 5.5 to 7.8).\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5, and pH 6.1 to 7.8.  The lamellae of the B2t horizon are typically sandy clay loam or clay loam but have 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 30 to 70 percent percent sand with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  The matrix of the B2t horizon is typically sandy loam and the mixed texture is typically light sandy clay loam or heavy loam with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand and with high mica content.  This horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline (pH 6.1 to 7.8).\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR.  Gnesis and schist rock in the C horizon are strongly weathered and frequently can be crushed in the hand.  Mica content is high.  This horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline (pH 6.1 to 7.8)."

Kettle soils have coarse fragments consisting mainly of fine and very fine angular pebbles, have a large percentage of medium and coarse angular granite sands, have hard setting properties when dry in the horizons of low organic matter content, and have very gravelly loamy sand or sand C horizons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients are dominantly 2 to 30 percent.  The soil formed in thick micaceous alluvial fan sediments derived principally from gnesis and schist bedrock.  At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 18 inches with peak period of precipitation during the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 62 degrees F."
