  "OVERVIEW": "The Floodwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from anorthosite, schist, and gneiss with a mantle of volcanic ash.  The Floodwood soils are on mountain slopes, ridges and foothills. Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 10 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
