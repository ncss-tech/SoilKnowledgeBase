These soils formed in material weathered from anorthosite, schist, and gneiss, with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 10 to 65 percent.  Elevations are 1,600 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is cool, humid with warm, moist summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 30 to 65 inches and the average annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 50 to 110 days."
