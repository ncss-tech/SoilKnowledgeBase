    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90  consecutive days within the four months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 8 to 15 inches.  There is an absolute increase in clay of 15 to 30 percent between the Bw and the 2Bt horizons.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick and includes the upper part of the 2Bt horizon.  The upper 7 to 14 inches of the solum is estimated to have 20 to 40 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has 10 to 20 percent clay and contains 25 to 40 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Organic matter is 4 to 6 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy silt loam or ashy silty clay loam and has 25 to 35 percent clay.  It contains 25 to 40 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Organic matter is 2 to 4 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay and has 50 to 60 percent clay.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay and has 50 to 60 percent clay.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel."

Patron soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock and has 35 to 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Prill soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Ridley soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock, are mildly alkaline in the 2Bt horizon, and have a 3Bk horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fawnspring soils are on gently sloping to steep north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Elevation ranges from 2200 to 3800 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Littlefawn soils are moderately deep to bedrock, and are on adjacent north-facing side slopes.  Mowako soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on south-facing side slopes.  Mutton soils are ashy-skeletal and are on adjacent north-facing side slopes.  Wakamo soils are clayey-skeletal, shallow to bedrock, and are on south-facing side slopes of mountains."
