  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 48 to 80 inches. The calcium-magnesium ratio is 1 or more. Clay content in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon typically contains 25 to 30 percent clay and ranges from 20 to 35. To a depth of 40 inches or more, the soil contains less than 5 percent sand. Some pedons have up to 15 percent sand below a depth of 40 inches.  This is generally a \"mixing zone\" that is transitional to a discontinuity to sandier coastal plain deposits. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the A and E horizons except where the surface has been limed. and from very strongly acid to moderately in the Bt, BC and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 3 to 5, and chroma 1 to 4. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue 7.5YR or 10YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma 4 or 6. Black coats and stains on faces of peds range from few to many. Silt coatings in shades of brown, yellow and gray along cracks and faces of peds range from none to common. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma 4 through 6. Some pedons have hue of 5YR and contain up to 15 percent sand in the lower parts of BC or C horizons that are transitions to a discontinuity to coastal plains deposits. Texture is silt loam.\nIn some pedons, a 2Bt horizon is present below a depth of 48 inches. Where present, it has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Pockets of sand or loamy sand in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common. Texture is sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Competing series are Armour, Dexter, Dossman, Goodwill, and Lexington series in the same family and the Barnsdall, Cascilla, Center, Lytle, Dubbs, Gallion, Rilla, Loring, Memphis and Siwell series in closely related families. Armour soils have silty clay loam to clay BC horizons that contain chert fragments. Barnsdall, Dubbs and Goodwill soils formed in alluvium or mixed loess and alluvium and have more than 5 percent sand within 40 inches of the surface. Gallion and Rilla soils formed in alluvium, have redder hue, and have more than 5 percent sand within 40 inches of the surface. Cascilla soils formed in alluvium, and do not have an Argillic horizon. Dossman soils have hue of 5YR or redder throughout the subsoil and formed in Pre-Peoria loess. Dexter and Lexington soils have a discontinuity to loamy coastal plains sediments within a depth of 4 feet.  Loring soils have a fragipan. Siwell soils have a discontinuity to clayey materials in the lower part of the solum. Center soils have aquic conditions and iron depletions of chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon. Memphis soils have higher base saturation in the lower part of the solum. Lytle soils have a discontinuity to loamy coastal plains sediments within a depth of 4 feet and have base saturation below 35 percent in the lower part of the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Feliciana soils are on nearly level to very steep uplands and terraces having slopes ranging from 0 to 40 percent. The soils formed in loess more than 4 feet thick. The climate is warm and humid. Near the type location, the annual precipitation is about 61.6 inches and the annual temperature is 65.7 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Besides the competing Lexington, Loring and Memphis soils.  These include the Bigbee, Calhoun, Natchez, Morganfield, and Olivier soils. Bigbee and Morganfield soils are on floodplains of drainageways. Calhoun, Loring, and Olivier soils occupy broader ridge tops, depressions, and heads of drainageways. Lexington soils are on shoulder or side slope positions and have a thinner loess cap. Memphis soils are on similar positions.  Natchez soils are on steeper more dissected side slopes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was updated in 2003 and was assigned to an active activity class.  Also, the nature of the material below the loess cap was added to the range in characteristics, and slightly redder colors and higher sand content were added for the transition zone in the lower part of the loess cap.  Further updates in 2014 include grammatical changes and the addition of GPS coordinates.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 5 to 65 inches, or more (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 and Bt4 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data on typifying pedon were obtained from the soils laboratory of the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station, sample S89LA37-46. Other laboratory data provided by the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station includes S89LA-037-66 and S89LA-037-62.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
