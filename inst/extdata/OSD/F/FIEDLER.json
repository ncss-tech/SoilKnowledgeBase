    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fiedler soils are on linear to concave positions on backslopes on mountains. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 30 to 450 meters. These soils formed in colluvium derived from weakly consolidated siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 2160 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 240 to 300 days."
