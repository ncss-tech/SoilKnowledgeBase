  "OVERVIEW": "The Fiedler series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from weakly consolidated siltstone, sandstone and conglomerate. Fiedler soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1275 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
