In noncultivated areas, the A horizon have hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3, or value of 4 and chroma of 2.  A horizons with value of 3 are less than 6 inches thick.  Iron-manganese accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray or brown.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is dominantly very strongly acid to moderately acid, but ranges to neutral from the addition of alkaline irrigation water.\nThe E horizon and E part of the B/E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron-manganese accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray or brown.  Texture is silt loam, silt, or very fine sandy loam.

Amagon and Jackport do not contain natric horizons.  Bonn and Lafe soils have natric horizons nearer the soils surface.  McCrory soils, which occur on lower terraces and floodplains, are in a fine-loamy particle-size class.  Calhoun, Calloway and Henry soils, which occur on higher loess cover terraces, do not contain natric horizons."
