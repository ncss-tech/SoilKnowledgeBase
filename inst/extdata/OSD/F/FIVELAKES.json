These soils are formed in glacial outwash with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 71 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.
