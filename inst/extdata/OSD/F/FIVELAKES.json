  "OVERVIEW": "The Fivelakes series consists of deep, well and moderately well drained soils formed in glacial outwash with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Elevation is 1,200 to 2,700 feet.  The average annual; precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
