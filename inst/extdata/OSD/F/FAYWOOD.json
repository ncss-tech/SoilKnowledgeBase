  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Limestone and shale flagstones and channers range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and up to 35 percent in the substratum.  The reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. In severely eroded areas the hue, value, and chroma are like that the of Bt horizon.  A few pedons have an A horizon less  than 7 inches thick with a value of 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Eroded areas allow a silty clay texture.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 5.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The lower part is commonly mottled in shades of brown or olive.  Texture is heavy silty clay loam to clay.\nThe BC or C horizons, where present, have colors and textures like the lower part of the Bt horizon."

Beasley, Eden, Shrouts, and Solway soils have paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Brashear soils can be moderately well drained.  Bratton soils have a lithologic discontinuity at 10 to 22 inches. Caneyville, Fredonia, and Heitt soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in at least some part of the B horizon.  Donahue soils have more than 20 percent sand in the upper part of the solum.  Haggatt and Lowell soils have a lithic or paralithic contact deeper than 40 inches. Markland soils have stratified lacustrine C horizons below 20 to 44 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Faywood soils are on ridgetops and side slopes of dissected uplands.  Some areas have rock outcrops and some are karst.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in limestone residuum interbedded with thin layers of shale.  Some areas are interbedded with siltstone.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F."

Ashton soils are located on low stream terraces and alluvial fans, have a dark colored surface layer, and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Bluegrass soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and have lithic contact at depths greater than 60 inches.  Caleast soils have a dark colored surface layer and have lithic contact at depths greater than 40 inches. Cynthiana and Fairmount soils have a solum thickness and depth to bedrock from 10 to 20 inches. Donerail soils have a dark colored surface layer, are moderately well drained, have hues of 10YR or yellower in the substratum, and have lithic contact at depths greater than 40 inches.  Elk soils are located on stream terraces, and are typically more acid, and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Loradale soils have a dark colored surface layer and have hues of 10YR or yellower in the substratum, and lithic contact depths greater than 40 inches.  Lowell soils have lithic contact at depths greater than 40 inches.  McAfee soils have a dark colored surface layer, and have at least one subsoil horizon is hue of 5YR. Nicholson soils are moderately well drained with a slowly permeable fragipan in the subsoil and have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section."
