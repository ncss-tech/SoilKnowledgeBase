  "OVERVIEW": "The Flott series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in till or colluvium derived from limestone or calcareous argillite.  These soils are on moraines, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
