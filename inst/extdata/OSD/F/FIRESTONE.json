Reaction ranges from\nstrongly to very strongly acid in the A horizon and the upper B horizon, except where limed, and from medium acid to very strongly acid in the lower B horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to\n4.  Texture is gravelly silt loam, silt loam, gravelly loam, or\nloam.  Content of siliceous pebbles ranges from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe B1 horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of\n5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay\nloam, or silty clay.  The B2t horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Mottles of various shades\nof brown, yellow, and red range from none to many.  Texture is\nclay.  The B3 horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y,\nvalue of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, or it is mottled in various shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  Content of shale fragment\nin the B2t and B3 horizons is 10 to 30 percent.  Clay content of\nthe control section is 60 to 75 percent."
