Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and residuum from rhyolite.  The climate is cool and moist in winter and hot and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches, and average annual temperature ranges from 47 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 95 to 115 days."
