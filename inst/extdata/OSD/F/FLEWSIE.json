  "OVERVIEW": "The Flewsie series consists of very deep, well drained soils on foothills, mountain slopes and ridges.  They formed in material weathered from fine-grained quartzite or quartz rich gneiss with a thick mantle of volcanic ash.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate.  Slope ranges from 5 to 90 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",
