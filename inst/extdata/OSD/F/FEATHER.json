Content of fine and coarser sands ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth and is more the 0.6 percent at 50 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizons have dry colors of 10YR 5/3 or 4/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3 or 3/2.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Ab horizon has dry colors of 10YR 5/4 or 5/3 mixed with 10YR 7/3. Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 3/2 or 2/2 mixed with 10YR 4/3.

The average annual precipitation is about 18 to 22 inches.  The average January temperature is 46 degrees F; the average July temperature is 79 degrees F; the mean annual temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 270 to 290 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Feather series was originally mapped in the 1909 soil survey of the Marysville area, California.  The series was made inactive (Jan. 1963) and listed as correlating to Columbia because the original type location could not be located and because it had not been mapped elsewhere.  This revision reestablishes the series, a new type location and redefines the concept of the original series.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 75 inches; is 60 or more inches thick.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
