  "OVERVIEW": "The Finol series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on uplands.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basic igneous rock.  Slope is 30 to 60 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 216 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 79 degrees F.",
