  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to shale bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  Stony phases are recognized. This soil has cracks during summer months in most years, one-half inch or more wide and at least 20 inches in length at a depth of 20 inches, has a linear extensibility of more than 2.5 inches and a COLE of 0.07 or more in some horizon.  It is calcareous and moderately alkaline in all horizons.  The low chroma colors are dominantly inherited from the parent material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam and contains flat limestone fragments greater than 75 mm. in length that range from 0 to 50 percent by volume and flat limestone fragments from 2 mm. to 75 mm. in length that range from 0 to 30 percent by volume.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam and contains flat limestone fragments greater than 75 mm. in length that range from 5 to 20 percent by volume and flat limestone fragments from 2 mm. to 75 mm. in length that range from 0 to 25 percent by volume.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4 or hue of 5Y, value of 5 and chroma of 1.  Some pedons have grayish, brownish, yellowish, or reddish redox depletions or iron concentrations.  This horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay.  The clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 55 percent, averaging about 40 percent.  Fragments of shale and calcium carbonate concretions from 2 mm. to 75 mm. in diameter range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have grayish, brownish, or yellowish mottles.  This horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Shale fragments and calcium carbonate concretions from 2 mm. to 75 mm. in diameter range from 5 to 75 percent by volume.\nThe Cr horizon is dominantly coarsely mottled in shades of gray, brown, or olive; which colors are inherited from the shale parent material.  It is mainly laminated silty shale interbedded with limestone, but some areas are compact silty clay.  Some pedons have films of calcium carbonate in between the rock structure of the shale."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Benchley, Caradan, Durant, Flatonia, and Tabler series.  Benchley, Caradan, Durant, Flatonia, and Tabler soils all have a solum more than 40 inches thick.  In addition, Benchley, Caradan, and Flatonia soils have mean annual temperature over 64 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Foraker soils occur on convex moderately steep or steep slopes of prairie uplands.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  These soils have formed in material weathered from alkaline shales interbedded with thin layers of limestone of Pennsylvanian age.    The climate is moist subhumid.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 54 to 64; average annual precipitation ranges from 31 to 38 inches; and the annual mean temperature ranges from 58 degrees to 63 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 200 to 220 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1200 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Grainola series on similar landscapes, and the Apperson and Shidler series. Apperson soils are on broad, smooth ridges and gently sloping side slopes and have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick over hard limestone.  Shidler soils are on higher landscapes, do not have a Bt horizon, have a fine-silty control section, and are less than 20 inches to hard limestone."
