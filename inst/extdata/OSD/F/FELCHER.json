  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Felcher soils are on plateaus, hills, canyonlands and mountains. They typically occur on shoulder, backslope, and footslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rock such as welded tuff or basalt. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. Elevations range from 1,250 to 2,170 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
