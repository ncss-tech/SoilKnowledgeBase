  "OVERVIEW": "The Felcher series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Felcher soils are on plateaus, hills, canyonlands, and mountains. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rock such as welded tuff or basalt. Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. Elevations range from 1,250 to 2,170 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
