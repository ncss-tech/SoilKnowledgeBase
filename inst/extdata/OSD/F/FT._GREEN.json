  "OVERVIEW": "The Ft. Green series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  These soils are rapidly permeable in the A and E horizon and moderately slowly or slowly permeable in the Bt horizon.  They are on side slopes breaking into flood plains or depressional areas and on broad nearly level low ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature 20 inches below the surface ranges from 72 degrees to 75 degrees F.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the A and E horizons and from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the B and C horizons.  Cobbles range from 0 to 20 percent in the lower E2 horizon and 15 to 30 percent in the upper Btg horizon.  Bouldery phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or less or is neutral.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or less or is neutral.  Mottles of yellow or brown range from none to common.  Texture of the E horizon is dominantly fine sand or sand, but ranges to cobbly fine sand in the lower part.  A thin Bw horizon occurs in some pedons.  It has hue of 10YR, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less, or is neutral.  Some pedons have mottles of brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is cobbly fine sandy loam,  cobbly sandy clay loam, cobbly sandy clay, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay. Clay content averages 18 to 35 percent in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.\nWhere present, a C horizon has the same colors and textures as the B horizon.  Carbonatic nodules and limestone boulders are none to common."

In addition, Boca soils are underlain with limestone within 40 inches of the surface.  Felda soils have a thinner solum.  Pinellas soils have Bk horizons, and Roemer soils are somewhat poorly drained."
