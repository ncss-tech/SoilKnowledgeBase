(3 to 7 inches thick.)\nE1--6 to 17 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) fine sand; single grained; loose; many fine and medium roots; many clean sand grains; slightly acid; gradual wavy boundary.\nE2--17 to 31 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) fine sand; single grained; loose; common fine and medium roots; 10 to 15 percent cobbles; slightly acid; abrupt wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature 20 inches below the surface ranges from 72 degrees to 75 degrees F.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the A and E horizons and from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the B and C horizons.  Cobbles range from 0 to 20 percent in the lower E2 horizon and 15 to 30 percent in the upper Btg horizon.  Bouldery phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or less or is neutral.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or less or is neutral.  Mottles of yellow or brown range from none to common.  Texture of the E horizon is dominantly fine sand or sand, but ranges to cobbly fine sand in the lower part.  A thin Bw horizon occurs in some pedons.  It has hue of 10YR, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less, or is neutral.  Some pedons have mottles of brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is cobbly fine sandy loam,  cobbly sandy clay loam, cobbly sandy clay, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay. Clay content averages 18 to 35 percent in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon.\nWhere present, a C horizon has the same colors and textures as the B horizon.  Carbonatic nodules and limestone boulders are none to common."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boca, Felda, Isles, Pinellas, and Roemer series.  None of these have cobbly subsoils.  In addition, Boca soils are underlain with limestone within 40 inches of the surface.  Felda soils have a thinner solum.  Pinellas soils have Bk horizons, and Roemer soils are somewhat poorly drained."

The soils formed in unconsolidated marine sands and clays.  At the type location, average annual precipitation is 48 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 73 degrees F."

Bradenton soils have an A horizon less than 20 inches thick.  EauGallie, Immokalee, Myakka and Wabasso soils have spodic horizons.  Holopaw soils have an A horizon more than 40 inches thick.  Pompano soils are sandy throughout and lack an argillic horizon."
