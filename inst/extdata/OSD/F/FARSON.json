  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Farson soils are on nearly level to sloping relict fan aprons and fan pediments.  They formed in stratified, calcareous alluvium derived from sandstone and other coarse sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent and simple.  Elevations are 6,200 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 13 inches with about half falling as snow or less commonly rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 34 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free period is estimated to range from 60 to 85 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bosler and Vonet soils.  Bosler soils have more than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon and have a diagnostic contrasting particle-size control section.  Vonet soils are sandy throughout and have cambic horizons.  These soils occur in the same relative positions as the Farson soils, but micro topography accounts for the difference in development."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; low to medium runoff depending upon surface texture and slope; permeability in the upper part is moderate and is rapid in the substratum.  When irrigated, these soils may develop a water table at depths below 5 feet due to perched water on the underlying shale beds."
