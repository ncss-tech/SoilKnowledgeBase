  "OVERVIEW": "The Farson series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in stratified alluvium.  Farson soils are on relict fan piedmonts and fan aprons.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Farson soils are on nearly level to sloping relict fan aprons and fan pediments.  They formed in stratified, calcareous alluvium derived from sandstone and other coarse sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent and simple.  Elevations are 6,200 to 7,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 13 inches with about half falling as snow or less commonly rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 34 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free period is estimated to range from 60 to 85 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."

Bosler soils have more than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon and have a diagnostic contrasting particle-size control section.  Vonet soils are sandy throughout and have cambic horizons.  These soils occur in the same relative positions as the Farson soils, but micro topography accounts for the difference in development."

When irrigated, these soils may develop a water table at depths below 5 feet due to perched water on the underlying shale beds."
