  "OVERVIEW": "The Frost series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in silty alluvium or loess. These soils are in broad depressional areas and in drainageways on late Pleistocene age terraces. Slope is dominantly less than 0.5 percent, but it ranges to 1 percent along narrow drainageways.",
