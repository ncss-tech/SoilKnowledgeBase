    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 48 to more than 80 inches. Depth to the discontinuity ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A and Eg horizons; from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the Btg/E and the Btg horizon; and from strongly acid to neutral in the the 2Btg and 2BCg horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2. Where value is 3, the thickness of the A or Ap horizon is less than 6 inches.\nThe Eg horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Btg part of the Btg/E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam. Iron depletions and masses of iron accumulation are in shades of gray and brown. The E part of the Btg/E horizon consists of vertical intrusions of albic material 1 to 6 inches wide that have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. The E parts make up 15 to 50 percent of the Btg/E horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam. Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, and iron depletions in shades of gray are present in most pedons. Peds are partially coated with dark gray (10YR 4/1), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), or black (10YR 2/1) clay films. Thin patches and streaks of uncoated silt between peds range from none to common.\nThe 2Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay. Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown or red, and iron depletions in shades of gray are present in most pedons. Thin patches and streaks of uncoated silt between peds range from none to common.\nThe 2BCg or 2C horizon, where present, is variegated in shades of gray, brown, and red. Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Calhoun, Ethel, and Gilbert series in the same family, and the Basile and Fountain series in closely related families. Calhoun soils do not have dark colored clay films in the Bt horizon. Ethel soils formed in alluvium. Gilbert soils have exchangeable sodium that ranges from 15 to 35 percent within 17 to 40 inches of the upper boundary of the B horizon. Basile and Fountain soils do not have dark colored clay films in the Bt horizon, have calcium carbonate concretions in the subsoil, and have a superactive activity class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Frost soils are in slightly depressional areas and in broad drainageways. They formed in late Pleistocene age deposits high in silt content over mid to late Pleistocene alluvial sediments. The upper materials have the characteristics of loess mixed with silty alluvium. The average annual temperature ranges from 65 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall is 50 to 65 inches. Elevation ranges from 0 to 50 feet above mean sea level."

All of these soils are on slightly higher positions than the Frost soil. Coteau and Duson soils are somewhat poorly drained and do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 20 inches. Deerford soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a natric horizon. Jeanerette soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a mollic epipedon.. Olivier soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a fragipan. Patoutville soils have red masses of iron accumulation in the upper part of the subsoil and do not have a glossic horizon."
