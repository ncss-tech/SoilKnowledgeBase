  "OVERVIEW": "The Fondillas series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum derived from sandstone and siltstone.  Fondillas soils are on plateaus.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
