  "OVERVIEW": "The Flycreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from acidic tuffs. Flycreek soils are on shoulders and back slopes of mountains. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
