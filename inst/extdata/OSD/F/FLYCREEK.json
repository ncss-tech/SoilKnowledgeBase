The soil is formed in ash over residuum and colluvium derived from acidic tuffs. Elevations are 3,600 to 6,200 feet. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 35 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."
