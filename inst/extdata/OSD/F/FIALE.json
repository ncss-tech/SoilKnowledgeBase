Aido soils are moderately alkaline and always have Bssk horizons with disseminated and segregated carbonates, lack chromas of 1 in the profile, and have none to a few weak slickensides. Alo and Bosanko soils are slightly to moderately alkaline and always have Bk horizons with disseminated and segregated carbonates, lack chromas of 1 in the profile. Altamont, Auld, and Diablo soils have a paralithic contact at a depth greater than 40 inches and calcareous horizons with disseminated and segregated carbonates. Auld soils also have 5YR hues. Cibo and Sehorn soils are slightly acid to moderately alkaline and have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Cropley and Porterville soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock and have calcareous horizons with disseminated and segregated carbonates. Myers soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock and lack a lithic contact or paralithic materials. Vaquero soils are neutral to strongly alkaline and have calcareous horizons with disseminated and segregated carbonates.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fiale soils are on crests and side slopes of hills on Islands. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. The soils formed in residuum from basalt, andesite and breccia. Elevations are 50 to 1300 feet (15 to 396 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 24 inches (330 to 660 mm), the mean annual temperature is 61 to 73 degrees F. (16 to 23 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 320 to 365 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Halyard, Spinnaker, Tongva, and Topdeck soils. All these soils lack cracks that open and close and lack slickensides. These soils are on hills and mountains.\nDRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Well drained; high runoff; slow permeability.\nUSE AND VEGETATION: Wildlife habitat, recreation and building site development. Vegetation is mostly grasses usually dominated by wild oats.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Santa Barbara County, California on Santa Cruz Island and Santa Rosa Island. The soil is not extensive.
