Aido soils are moderately alkaline and always have Bssk horizons with disseminated and segregated carbonates, lack chromas of 1 in the profile, and have none to a few weak slickensides. Alo and Bosanko soils are slightly to moderately alkaline and always have Bk horizons with disseminated and segregated carbonates, lack chromas of 1 in the profile. Altamont, Auld, and Diablo soils have a paralithic contact at a depth greater than 40 inches and calcareous horizons with disseminated and segregated carbonates. Auld soils also have 5YR hues. Cibo and Sehorn soils are slightly acid to moderately alkaline and have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Cropley and Porterville soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock and have calcareous horizons with disseminated and segregated carbonates. Myers soils are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock and lack a lithic contact or paralithic materials. Vaquero soils are neutral to strongly alkaline and have calcareous horizons with disseminated and segregated carbonates."
