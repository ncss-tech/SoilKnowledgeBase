  "OVERVIEW": "The Frankirk series comprises very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Quaternary age. These soils occur on gently sloping terraces on dissected plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and mean annual temperature is about 17.2 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
