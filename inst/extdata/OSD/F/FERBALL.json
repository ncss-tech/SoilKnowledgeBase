  "OVERVIEW": "The Ferball series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, strike valleys and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
