  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The range in characteristics includes 50 percent or more of the pedon.  Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact of chalk ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the control section is 40 to 50 percent.  When dry, cracks ranging from 0.4 to 3 inches wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches.  Cracks are open for 90 to 150 cumulative days in most years.  Slickensides and/or wedge shaped peds begin at a depth of 8 to 20 inches.  These are cyclic soils, and in undisturbed areas, gilgai microrelief consists of microknolls 4 to 16 inches higher than microdepressions; distance between center of knoll and center of the depression is 5 to 12 feet.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline, and ranges from very slight to strong effervescence.  There are few to common concretions and soft masses of calcium carbonate and/or chalk fragments in most subhorizons.  Iron-manganese concretions and siliceous pebbles range from none to few throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has colors in hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  The texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bss horizon has colors in hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Redox concentrations or masses with sharp boundaries in shades of brown, yellow, or olive range from none to common.\nThe Bkss horizons has colors in hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Redox concentrations or masses with sharp boundaries in shades of brown, yellow, or olive range from none to common.\nIn some pedons, there is a discontinuous C horizon of clay, silty clay, or marly clay with thin strata of weathered chalk.  Colors are mainly in shades of gray, olive, or brown.  The C horizon is not diagnostic to the series and is absent in most pedons.\nThe Cr horizon is limestone bedrock.  It is mainly chalk, or interbedded chalk and marl.  It is light gray or white, and typically platy in the upper few inches, and massive below with a hardness of less than 3 on Mohs' scale."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bleiblerville, Branyon, Burleson, Dimebox, Heiden, Houston Black, Ovan, Leson, Luling, Sanger, Slidell, and Watonga series.  These soils do not have a paralithic contact with chalk within a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fairlie soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands.  They formed mainly in the Pecan Gap, Gober, and Austin Chalk Formations of Upper Cretaceous Age.  Slopes are mainly 1 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 42 inches, mean annual temperature from 64 degrees to 68 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 230 to 260.  Elevation ranges from 550 to 850 feet above sea level. Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 54 to 70."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Branyon, Burleson, Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson series.  Also the Austin, Dalco, and Lott soils are associated.  Austin and Lott soils are mollisols on slightly higher convex areas.  Branyon and Burleson soils are on lower lying terrace positions.  Dalco soils are 24 to 40 inches thick over a paralithic contact of chalk and are on similar positions.  Heiden, Houston Black, and Leson soils are on similar positions of adjacent areas with different parent material."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Fairlie soils are moderately well drained and very slow permeablility.  Water enters the soil rapidly when it is dry and cracked, and very slow when the soil is saturated.  Runoff is low on 0 to 1 percent slopes; moderate on 1 to 3 percent slopes; and high on 3 to 5 percent slopes."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used mainly for cultivated crops of cotton, grain sorghum, corn, and small grain, however, some areas are used for pasture and a few small areas are in rangeland.  Pastures are mainly bermudagrasses; rangeland plants include eastern grama, little bluestem, indiangrass, Florida paspalum, sideoats grama, switchgrass, meadow dropseed, forbs and annual grasses."
