  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 to 80 inches.\nThe soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout except\nfor surface layers that have been limed.  Base saturation of the lower Bt horizon is 35 to 60 percent.\nThe A1 horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown\n(10YR 4/2), or brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3) silt loam or loam.\nThe B horizon part of the B/E horizon is pale brown (10YR\n6/3), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4), brown (10YR 5/3), or yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), silt loam or loam with common to many mottles in shades of gray or grayish brown.  The E horizon\npart of the B and A horizon consists of streaks or spots, of interfingers of less clayey material that is pale brown (10YR\n6/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/2) and makes up 5 to 15 percent of the horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is brown (10YR 4/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4,\n5/6), or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4) mottled with shades of gray.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  Sand content in the B horizon which is dominantly very fine averages 10\nto about 30 percent.\nThe C horizon is yellowish brown or gray silt loam, silty clay\nloam, loam, or clay loam that contains few to many grayish\nmottles."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Series\nin related families are the Beauregard, Bude, Calloway, Center, Coteau, Falkner, Goldman, Longview, Muskogee, Tippo, Tutwiler, and Vidrine series.  Beauregard soils have more than 5 percent\nplinthite, base saturation below 35 percent, and more than 18\npercent clay in the upper B horizon.  Bude and Calloway soils are bisequal with a fragipan in the lower B horizon.  Center soils\nlack thick B and A horizons, have higher base status, and contain less sand.  Coteau and Longview soils have fine-silty control sections.  Goldman soils lack the thick B and A horizons and have over 60 percent base saturation.  Tippo soils lack the thick B and\nA horizons and have a weakly expressed fragipan.  Tutwiler soils\nlack the thick B and A horizons, have over 60 percent base\nsaturation and lack low chromas in the upper argillic horizon.  Muskogee and Falkner soils lack thick B and A horizons and have higher clay content in the upper B horizon.  Vidrine soils have coarse-silty over clayey control sections."
