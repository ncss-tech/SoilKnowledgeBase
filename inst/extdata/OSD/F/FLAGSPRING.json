Boden soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. Braddock, Casville, Clifton, and Clover soils typically have mica flakes in the profile. Buffstat and Totier soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Christian soils are formed in residuum of interbedded limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and shale and do not have parafragments. Danripple, Groseclose, Howell, and Yellowbottom soils have a solum less than 60 inches in depth.  Mount Rush, Muse, Sequola, and Spears Mountian soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Rapidan soils formed from greenstone conglomerate rock and do not have parafragments.  Unison soils formed in crystalline rocks and do not have parafragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in colluvium from cherty limestone over residuum from limestone and tripoli of the Burlington/Keokuk formation (Mississippian age). The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 60 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Soil temperature data collected from this site for over 5 years indicates that the temperature regime overlaps mesic and thermic. The series was classified as mesic in order to match the adjacent series in mapping.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (A and E horizons).\n2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 10 to 80 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, 3B/C1, and 3B/C2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon ID number 95MO119010. University of Missouri Soil Characterization Laboratory sample number M9511910.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
