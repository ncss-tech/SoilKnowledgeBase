  "OVERVIEW": "The Flagspring series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands. They formed in colluvium from cherty limestone over residuum from limestone and tripoli on ridge tops. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

Boden soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. Braddock, Casville, Clifton, and Clover soils typically have mica flakes in the profile. Buffstat and Totier soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Christian soils are formed in residuum of interbedded limestone, sandstone, siltstone, and shale and do not have parafragments. Danripple, Groseclose, Howell, and Yellowbottom soils have a solum less than 60 inches in depth.  Mount Rush, Muse, Sequola, and Spears Mountian soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Rapidan soils formed from greenstone conglomerate rock and do not have parafragments.  Unison soils formed in crystalline rocks and do not have parafragments."
