  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Antholop, Esmod, Grassycan, Kunaton, Puls, Ridenbaugh, and Rogerson series.\nAntholop soils have moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline Bt horizons, have 40 to 60 percent cobbles and stones in the duripan, and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 cumulative days between July and October due to convection storms. Esmod soils are influenced by volcanic ash and have duripans which are weakly to strongly cemented. Grassycan soils have lithic contacts at depths of 18 to 36 cm.  Kunaton soils have lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Puls soils have lithic contacts at depths of 28 to 150 cm.  Ridenbaugh soils have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Rogerson soils have duripans that are 8 to 18 cm thick and do not have skeletal material below the duripan."
