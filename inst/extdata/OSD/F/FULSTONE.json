  "OVERVIEW": "The Fulstone series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Fulstone soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

Esmod soils are influenced by volcanic ash and have duripans which are weakly to strongly cemented. Grassycan soils have lithic contacts at depths of 18 to 36 cm.  Kunaton soils have lithic contacts at depths of 50 to 100 cm.  Puls soils have lithic contacts at depths of 28 to 150 cm.  Ridenbaugh soils have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Rogerson soils have duripans that are 8 to 18 cm thick and do not have skeletal material below the duripan."
