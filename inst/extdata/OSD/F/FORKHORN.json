  "OVERVIEW": "The Forkhorn series consists of very deep, well drained soils which are moderately deep to sandy outwash on outwash terraces of valley trains.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium and in the underlying sandy outwash. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy alluvium and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the loamy alluvium and depth to sandy outwash range from 20 to 40 inches.  The substratum averages 90 percent or more total sand and 10 percent or more coarse and very coarse sand. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent but averages less than 12 percent in the loamy alluvium.  Volume of gravel averages from 1 to 35 percent in the sandy outwash but ranges from 0 to 50 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with color and texture like the Ap horizon. Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Typically, it is sandy loam but in some pedons it has subhorizons of fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6, or it is multicolored. It typically is stratified layers of sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has color, texture, and reaction like the 2BC horizon described above."

Backbone soils have carbonates at depths of less than 40 inches.  Billett and Ulster soils have less than 10 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the sandy outwash in the lower part of the series control section.  In addition, Ulster soils do not have rock fragments in the sandy outwash in the lower part of the series control section.  Desker soils average 12 to 25 percent rock fragments in the loamy upper part of the series control section.  Kevilar, Kingsley, Oronoco, and Pardeeville soils have less than 90 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  In addition, Oronoco soils have redox features in the series control section.  Renwick soils have lamellae (E&Bt horizon) in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Rusktown soils have redox features and a water table in the lower part of the series control section."

The excessively drained Plainfield soils are in similar landscape positions where the soil is sandy throughout.  The moderately well drained Rusktown soils are in slightly lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with Forkhorn soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Prior to 1995, this soil was mapped as the Billett series.  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon (darker than Typic) - 0 to 8 inches (Ap); argillic horizon - 8 to 28 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3).\nLab data from similar soils indicates that Forkhorn soils have base saturation of 50 percent or more (by NH4OAc) in all horizons between the upper boundary of the argillic and a depth of 125 cm.  However, it is suspected that the very low CEC in the sandy outwash results in drastic changes in B.S. with the addition of few bases from fertilization in cropland areas. These soils may be Ultic in their natural state."
