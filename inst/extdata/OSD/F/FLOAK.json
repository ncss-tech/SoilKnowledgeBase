  "REVDATE": "09/2016",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Floak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over limestone or calcareous sandstone.  Depth to hard bedrock is 50 to 100 cm.  Floak soils are on mountain slopes and dip slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",
