  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Feldhauser soils are on remnant moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The Feldhauser soils formed in loamy till or glaciofluvial deposits underlain by sandy material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 864 mm (30 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F). Elevation is 366 to 457 meters (1200 to 1500 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blue Lake, Graycalm, Kalkaska, Montcalm, and Rubicon soils. The well drained Blue Lake and Montcalm soils and the somewhat excessively drained Graycalm soils have sandy textures in the upper part of the profile and occur on similar landscape positions. The somewhat excessively drained Kalkaska and the excessively drained Rubicon soils are sandy throughout and occur on similar landscape positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. The water table perches for a very short duration (3 to 5 weeks) in the spring and fall. Saturation occurs above the 2E and Bt horizon. Once saturation occurs above this point, the tension zone is broken and water moves readily downward. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium depending on slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy material and high or very high in the sandy material. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and rapid in the sandy material."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Areas of this soil are about equally divided between cropland and woodland. Where cultivated, the principal crop is hay. Native forest vegetation includes sugar maple, American basswood, American beech, yellow birch, eastern hop hornbeam, and bigtooth aspen."
