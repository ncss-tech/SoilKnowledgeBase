  "OVERVIEW": "The Fredonia series consists of moderately deep, well drained upland soils formed in residuum from limestone.  Permeability is moderately slow or slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of chert range from 0 to 5 percent.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and Bt1 horizons, except where limed, and from strongly acid through neutral in the Bt2 horizons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture  is silt loam or silty clay loam, and in some severely eroded areas, silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Some pedons have silty clay loam BA, Bt1 horizons with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.\nSome pedons have a C or CB horizon with colors and textures like the Bt horizons, and some are mottled in shades of brown, yellow, or gray."

Only the Bland, Bratton, Caneyville, Chrome, Donahue, Edenton, Faywood, and Milton series have lithic contact at\na depth less than 40 inches.  Bland soils have chromas of 2 or 3 in the Bt2 horizon.  Bratton soils have a lithologic discontinuity at\n10 to 20 inches, and skeletans in the BA or B&A horizon.  Caneyville, Donahue, Edenton, Faywood, and Milton soils have B horizons with hues yellower than 2.5YR. Chrome soils have solum thickness of less than 20 inches, an exchange complex dominated by magnesium, and have formed in residuum from serpentine rock."
