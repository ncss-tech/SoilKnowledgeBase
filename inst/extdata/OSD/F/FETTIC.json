  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fettic soils are on low stream terraces.  The terraces are dissected by many deep drainage channels and sloughs.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,370 to 1,560 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
