  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mineral solum ranges from 50 to 76 cm.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 150 cm.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the soil and Cd layer. Rock fragments are typically channers but include flagstones, gravel, cobbles, and stones in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent in the mineral solum and 10 to 35 percent in the substratum.\nOi, Oe, and/or, 0a horizons are present in forested areas. They have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 2.  Their combined thickness is 2 to 8 cm.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The lower part of the Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Low chroma is reflective of dark lithology.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Low chroma is reflective of dark lithology.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Cd layer has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has plates or is massive.  Consistence is firm or very firm."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the well drained Canterbury (T), Lanesboro, Shelburne, and Stowe series none of which have a zone within 60 cm of the soil surface that is, for more than 50 percent of the time, saturated throughout the 70 days following the spring solstice."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fullam soils are on backslopes and foot slopes of glaciated uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent.  They formed in dense, loamy till of Wisconsin age that is derived mainly from dark phyllites, slate, shale, and shist.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1270 mm, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 4.5 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free season ranges from 90 to 135 days."

These soils are in higher positions on the landscape.  The poorly drained Cabot soils, on toe slopes and depressions, are also associated."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are in pasture or are forested.  Some cleared areas are used for corn silage and hay.  The principal coniferous species are balsam fir, eastern hemlock, eastern white pine, and red spruce.  Northern hardwoods include sugar maple, red maple, yellow birch, paper birch, American beech, northern red oak, white oak and hickory."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The series subgroup is revised from Aquic Dystrudept to Oxyaquic Dystrudept with this revision as supported by the preponderance of documentation.  The type location is changed with this revision due to temperature data that suggests the previous type location is situated in an area of mesic temperature regime; the series concept is frigid.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 cm (Oe and A horizons).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 15 to 56 cm (Bw and BC horizons).\nc.  Oxyaquic feature - few fine massess of iron accumulation from 23 to 56 cm (Bw2 and BC horizons).\nd.  Dystrudepts feature - the base saturation (by ammonium acetate) is less than 60 percent in all subhorizons at a depth\nbelow the mineral soil surface from 25 to 75 cm or densic contact.\ne.  Densic materials - the zone from 56 to 165 cm (Cd layer).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data is available for sample no. S80VT025-001 and S80VT025-002 from The National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
