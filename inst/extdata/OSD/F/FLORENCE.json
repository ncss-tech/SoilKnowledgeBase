  "OVERVIEW": "The Florence series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from cherty limestone. Florence soils are on hillslopes on uplands in Bluestem Hills, MLRA 76. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 11 degrees C (53 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters (32 inches), at the type location.",
