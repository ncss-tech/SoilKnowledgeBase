    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Foyslake soils are on moraines in glaciated valleys and on mountain slopes. Elevations are 2,900 to 5,200 feet. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Aspects are northerly, where shade minimizes evapotranspiration. These soils formed in calcareous till. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 30 inches, much of which falls as snow or as spring rain. Mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."

They are ustic, shallow to carbonates, and lack an argillic horizon. McMannamy soils are on concave and linear positions on southerly aspects, and convex positions on more shaded aspects. They are ustic and shallow to carbonates, but have a thin argillic horizon. Jimlake soils occur on concave, north sloping aspects above 4300 feet elevation. They generally have a thick ash mantle, cryic soil temperature regime, and are deep or very deep to carbonates."
