  "OVERVIEW": "The Forbidden series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash, colluvium, and glacial drift on valley walls, debris cones, and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent on debris cones and terraces and 35 to 90 percent on valley walls.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,800 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
