Slopes are 0 to 35 percent on debris cones and terraces and 35 to 90 percent on valley walls.  These soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with reworked glacial drift and colluvium.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1,800 to 3,300 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 30 to 60 days."

Spickard soils form on more stable portions of valley walls and debris aprons and have andic soil properties greater than 36 centimeters.  Tepeh soils have finer textures on valley walls and debris aprons."
