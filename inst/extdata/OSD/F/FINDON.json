  "OVERVIEW": "The Findon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from mixed rock sources over residuum weathered from shale and siltstone.  These soils occur on hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
