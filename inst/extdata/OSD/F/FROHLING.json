    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Soperton and Steuben series and the closely related Schweitzer series.  Soperton soils have a 12 to 36 inch thick mantle with more than 50 percent silt.  Steuben soils average more than 85 percent sand in the series control section within a depth of 40 inches.  The closely related Schweitzer soils are superactive and average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the series control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frohling soils are on ground moraines and end moraines of Wisconsinan age.  These soils commonly occur on dissected landscapes with slopes ranging from 1 to 70 percent.  The Frohling soils formed in loamy till which appears to be derived from Jacobsville sandstone.  Elevations range from 850 to 1500 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 38 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from 100 to 130 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Frohling soils are associated with Abbaye, Kalkaska, Munising, Onota, Skanee, and Tokiahok soils.  The Tokiahok, Kalkaska, Onota and Abbaye soils occur in similar landscape positions and are often in complexes with Frohling.  Tokiahok soils formed in sandy outwash overlying loamy glacial till.  Kalkaska soils formed in sandy glacial deposits.  The Onota and Abbaye soils formed in loamy material 20 to 40 inches thick overlying sandstone bedrock.  The moderately well drained Munising and somewhat poorly drained Skanee soils are found on adjacent lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with the Frohling soils."
