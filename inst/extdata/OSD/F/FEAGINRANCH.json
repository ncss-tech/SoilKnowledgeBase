  "OVERVIEW": "The Feaginranch series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in stratified, mixed alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface horizons. Feaginranch soils are in mountain valleys on flood plains in old stream meander channels and at the confluence of side streams. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soils are saturated throughout in the spring and early summer. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. There is an irregular decrease in organic carbon below the mollic epipedon. The upper 10 to 20 inches is influenced by volcanic ash.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 45 percent clay and averages less than 15 percent gravel. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 5 dry, and chroma 0 or 1 moist or dry. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel. It has few to common distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations. It is estimated to have a phosphate retention of more than 25 percent, 5 to 15 percent volcanic glass, and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. It is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe 3Ab horizon, when present, has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2moist or dry. It has 30 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 3C and 4C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.

They are in old stream meander channels or at the confluence of small tributary streams corresponding to a slight reduction in slope. Elevations are 3,400 to 5,400 feet. The soils formed in stratified mixed alluvium derived mainly from basalt with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface horizons. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 35 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."

The Akerite soils are on adjacent higher forested foot slopes, fans, and old stream terraces, are frigid and xeric, and have an ash mantle 14 to 30 inches thick. The Tamara and Tolo soils are on adjacent forested north-facing slopes. The Tolo soils are frigid and xeric, and have an ash mantle 20 to 40 inches thick. The Tamara soils are frigid and udic, and have an ash mantle 20 to 40 inches thick. Klicker soils are on adjacent forested south-facing slopes, are frigid and xeric, and are loamy-skeletal."
