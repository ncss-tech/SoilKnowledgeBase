    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fidalgo soils are on hillslopes at elevations of 20 to 1,300 feet.  They formed in colluvium, glacial till and residuum from serpentine, argillite, and basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  Slopes range from 3 to 90 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches.  Average estimated January temperature is about 36 degrees F, average estimated July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 160 to 210 days."
