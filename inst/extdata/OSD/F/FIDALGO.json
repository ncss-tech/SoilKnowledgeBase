  "OVERVIEW": "The Fidalgo series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium from bedrock and glacial till with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  These soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes are 3 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
