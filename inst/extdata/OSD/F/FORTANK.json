  "OVERVIEW": "The Fortank series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from andesite, rhyolite and quartzite.  These soils are on low hill and mountain side slopes. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
