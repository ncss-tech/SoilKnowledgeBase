  "OVERVIEW": "The Flatron series consists of soils that are well drained and very shallow to bedrock. They formed in colluvium over residuum from welded tuff.  They are on ridges and dipslopes.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
