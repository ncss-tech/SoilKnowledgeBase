  "OVERVIEW": "The Fishers series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from basalt.  The Fishers soils are on mesas, mountain slopes, and plateaus.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: the zone from 0 to 9 inches. (A1 and A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: the zone from 14 to 47 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nThe Fishers series was originally classified as Loamy-skeletal, mixed, mesic Aridic Haplustolls, but was determined to have an argillic horizon and to be in a frigid temperature regime.  These soils are borderline to Mollisols but have an argillic horizon that exceeds the two-thirds thickness limitation for mollisols.  The original type location is not mapped as the series was formerly classified.  This revision documents the class change. Last updated by the state 4/2001."
