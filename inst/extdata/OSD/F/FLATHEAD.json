Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 34 inches (A and Bw, and C horizons);  Pachic Haploborolls have a mollic epipedon at least 16 inches thick;  may or may not have a cambic horizon.\nAs of 3/2009 this description is being entered for the first time into the OSD files.  Although it was established in 1929, it never existed in an electronic form.  Except for the classification, it has not been reviewed or updated since 1985.\nThe original classification of Flathead was Coarse-loamy, mixed Pachic Haploborolls."
