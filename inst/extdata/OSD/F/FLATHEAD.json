The climate is characterized by long, cold winters, moist springs and falls, and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 34 inches (A and Bw, and C horizons);  Pachic Haploborolls have a mollic epipedon at least 16 inches thick;  may or may not have a cambic horizon.\nAs of 3/2009 this description is being entered for the first time into the OSD files.  Although it was established in 1929, it never existed in an electronic form.  Except for the classification, it has not been reviewed or updated since 1985.\nThe original classification of Flathead was Coarse-loamy, mixed Pachic Haploborolls.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
