  "OVERVIEW": "The Fico series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from granite or gneiss with a thick mantle of volcanic ash. They are on mountain slopes and ridges. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and high in the lower part. Slopes range from 5 to 70 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 46 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
