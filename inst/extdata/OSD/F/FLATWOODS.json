Rock fragments of shale range from 0 to 10 percent in the A and E horizons, 0 to 15 percent in the B horizon, 0 to 35 percent in the BC horizon, and 35 to 60 percent in the C horizon, where present. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 6. It is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. Chroma of 2 is restricted to the lower part of the Bt horizon. It commonly is mottled in shades of red, brown, and gray in the lower part. The Bt horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon commonly is mottled with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 8. It is silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, is mottled with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 8. It is silty clay or clay in the fine-earth fraction."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Flatwoods soils have been included in the Needmore series in the past. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 3 to 9 inches (A and E horizons).\nb. Argillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 35 inches (Bt and BC horizons).\nc. Aquic feature - mottles of chroma 2 or less at 20 inches (Bt3 horizon).\nd. lithic contact ? at 35 inches (top of R horizon)\nThe 12/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature redoximorphic features and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 10/90"
