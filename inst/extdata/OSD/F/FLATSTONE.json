  "OVERVIEW": "The Flatstone series consists of very deep, well drained soils occurring on the sideslopes of undulating to rolling tablelands and on caldera floors. These soils formed in local alluvium and residuum from loess, volcanic ash, or rhyolite tuff. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. Flatstone soils havemoderate permeability. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
