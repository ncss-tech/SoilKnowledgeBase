  "OVERVIEW": "The Fergie series consists of deep, well drained soils on foothills and canyonsides.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived predominantly from welded tuff, rhyolite and basalt.  Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees.",
