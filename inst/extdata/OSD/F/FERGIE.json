The Apmat soil has 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.   Little Wood soils are moderately deep to loose sand and gravel.  Durst, Fraval, Kalo, Klicker, Mulshoe, and Sapkin soils have either a paralithic or lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  Henhoit, Klickson and Morningstar soils have O horizons and are dry less than 90 days in summer and fall.   Sattley soils have an O horizon and are moderately or strongly acid in the argillic horizon."
