  "OVERVIEW": "The Ferteg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glaciofluvial deposits.  Ferteg soils are on valley side slopes and terraces at elevations of 700 to l,700 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 F.",

It has faint to prominent mottles with chroma of 1 to 6 moist.  This horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam and has thin laminae of fine sand and gravelly sand in some pedons.  Some pedons lack a 2BC horizon and have a 2Bw horizon with similar colors and texture and moderate structure.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 to 7 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ferteg soils are on valley side slopes, benches, and terraces at elevations of 700 to 1,700 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in alluvial ash deposits over glaciofluvial sediments.  They are in areas where tributary drainages project into the valley of the Cowlitz River. These obstructions created areas of stagnation in the glacial meltwater stream where the finer sediments settled.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 55 to 70 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 F.  Growing season (28 F) is 160 to 240 days.  The frost-free period is 160 to 180 days."

Also, Domell soils are loam and sandy loam throughout.  Hoffstadt soils are medial-skeletal."
