    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly included in the Heiden series. Classification change from Chromic Udic Haplusterts to Udic Calciusterts based on application of the 6th edition of Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in)(A, Bk, Bkss1, and Bkss2 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 20 to 51 cm (8 to 20 in) (Bk horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 91 to 180 cm (36 to 71 in) (Bkss2, Bkss3, and Bkss4 horizons)\nVertic features: presence of slickensides at 51 to 203 cm (20 to 80 in) (Bkss1, Bkss2, Bkss3, Bkss4, and BCkss horizons)\nUstic features: Cracks that remain open 90 to 150 cumulative days in most years.\nRedoximorphic concentrations: 20 to 203 cm (8 to 80 in). (A, Bk, Bkss1, Bkss2, Bkss3, Bkss4, and BCkss horizons)\nRedoximorphic depletions: 91 to 132 cm (36 to 52 in). (Bkss2 horizons)\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: 91 to 203 (36 to 80 in). (Bkss2, Bkss3, Bkss4, and BCkss)\nAdditional Comments: When dry, the soil has cracks up to 3 to 8 cm (1 to 3 in) wide at the surface and extends to a depth greater than 51 cm (20 in) or more. The cracks remain open for a period of 90 to 150 cumulative days in most years. Slickensides begin at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 in) below the surface and extend throughout the solum. The range includes 50 percent or more of the pedon. Colors are not included for the chimneys, or high value materials that extend to the surface on some microknolls, and the center of some microdepressions that are thicker and/or darker.  These conditions make up 5 to 25 percent of most pedons.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil was described and sampled from 9 m (30 ft) long pit. Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory: S77TX-477-5 (78PO102-78PO104).
