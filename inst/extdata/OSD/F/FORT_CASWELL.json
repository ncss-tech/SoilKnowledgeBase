    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nFort Caswell is derived from Fort Caswell that is on the easternmost point of Oak Island at the mouth of the Cape Fear River. It was built in 1837 to guard the entrance of Southpoint harbor from potential threats from the Atlantic Ocean. The fort served as one of two primary training centers for soldiers before their departure for Europe in World War I. The fort was decommissioned in 1945.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are (Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Thirteenth Edition, 2022)--\nReduced Matrix--0 to 195 centimeters (0 to 77 inches); soil matrix that has low chroma in situ but undergoes a change in color within 30 minutes after the soil material has been exposed to air\nEndosaturation--0 to 195 centimeters (0 to 77 inches)\nFluventic subgroup--An organic carbon content of 0.2 percent or more at 125 centimeters or an irregular decrease in organic carbon at a depth of 25 to 125 centimeters.\nPeraquic feature--Zero or positive soil water potential at the soil surface.\nData Map Unit ID: 940074\nNASIS User Site and Pedon ID: S2022NC019116\n________________________________________"
