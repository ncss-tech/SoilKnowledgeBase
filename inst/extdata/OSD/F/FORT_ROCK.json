  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fort Rock soils are on lake terraces. These soils formed in volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from basalt and tuff. Most of the pumiceous volcanic ash is from ancestral Mt. Mazama (current site of Crater Lake). Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 1,480 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Abert soils are ashy, have a Bk horizon, and are on adjacent nearly level lake terraces. Bonnick soils are deep to stratified gravel and sand. Kunceider soils are ashy-skeletal, shallow to bedrock, and are on adjacent lava plains. Morehouse soils have a 2Bk horizon that is loam or silt loam and are on adjacent nearly level lake terraces and dunes. Wegert soils are ashy, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on adjacent lava plains."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 46 cm (A horizon and part of the BA horizon).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 71 cm (A, BA, and Bw1 horizon).\nMajor lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to sandy material at 71 cm (2Bw2 and 2Bq horizons and part of the 3C horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw1, 2Bw2, and 2Bq horizons and part of the 3C horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: A prior typical pedon was sampled and characterized as soil survey sample number S79OR-037-007. The typical pedon at the current series type location was reference sampled as soil survey sample number S94OR-037-001. Data for particle-size analysis, organic carbon content, optical grain counts, and acid oxalate extractions are available for the first three horizons of the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
