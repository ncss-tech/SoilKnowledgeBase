Arnor soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Augustine, Parkelei and Pinitos series have more than 35 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Bigbow soils have buried paleosol horizons. Carri, Celavar, Celacy, Evpark, Gateson, Nyjack and Ribera soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within 40 inches. Dermala soils have igneous or metamorphic parent material. Goesling and soils have calcic horizons and will reclassify in the Calcidic subgroup. Iwela soils have a skeletal discontinuity within 40 inches. Lykorly soils have annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F. Bosonoak and Orlie soils have less than 35 percent sand in the control section. Rockybutte soils have fragmental material within 40 inches. The Arwite, Bigbow, Dalhart, Deekay, Elwop, Fort Collins, Oldwolf, Olnest, Rauzi, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils are in LRR-E or LRR-G soils and are more moist in May and June."
