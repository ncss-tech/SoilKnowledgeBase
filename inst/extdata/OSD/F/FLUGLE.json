  "OVERVIEW": "The Flugle series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately to moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium, fan alluvium from shale and sandstone on summits of mesas, dipslopes of cuestas, hills, ridges and fan terraces and fan remnants on valley sides. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
