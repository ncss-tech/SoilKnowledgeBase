  "OVERVIEW": "Ferdinand series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on plateaus and steep south and west facing slopes in canyons.  They formed in loess over residuum weathered from basalt and other fine-grained basic igneous rock.  Slopes range from 0 to 90 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

Fenn soils are clayey from the surface and occupy concave positions on plateaus.  Gwinly soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and are on slopes having gradients up to 70 percent.  Lawyer soils are very deep and are on steep and very steep north-facing canyon slopes.  Meland soils are fine-loamy and are in toeslope position and in concave positions on canyon side slopes.  Nez Perce soils are fine-silty and are on undulating hillslopes.  Riggins soils are lithic and are on convex areas of canyon side slopes and in areas adjacent to rock outcrop.  Rockly soils are lithic and are on steep and very steep south and west-facing slopes."
