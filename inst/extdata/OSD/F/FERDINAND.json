    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ferdinand soils are on plateaus and south and west facing slopes in canyons.  Slopes range from 0 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in loess over residuum weathered from basalt and other fine-grained basic igneous rock at elevations of 2,000 to 4,300 feet.  The average annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches including 2 to 5 feet of snow.  Summers are dry.  The average frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."

Fenn soils are clayey from the surface and occupy concave positions on plateaus.  Gwinly soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and are on slopes having gradients up to 70 percent.  Lawyer soils are very deep and are on steep and very steep north-facing canyon slopes.  Meland soils are fine-loamy and are in toeslope position and in concave positions on canyon side slopes.  Nez Perce soils are fine-silty and are on undulating hillslopes.  Riggins soils are lithic and are on convex areas of canyon side slopes and in areas adjacent to rock outcrop.  Rockly soils are lithic and are on steep and very steep south and west-facing slopes."
