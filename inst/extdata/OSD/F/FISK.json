Poorly drained Keowns soils are in nearby depressional areas; somewhat poorly drained Yahara soils are on similar landscape positions; and well drained and moderately well drained Salter soils are on higher terraces.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Fisk soils were formerly mapped as inclusions in the Rimer series in Winnebago County. The soils of this series are arenic, but subgroup of Aquic Arenic Dystric Eutrudepts is not provided for in Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); cambic horizon - 61 to 99 cm (24 to 39 inches) (2Bw2, 2Bg1, 2Bg2);  dystric feature  no carbonates within 102 cm (40 inches) of the soil surface; aquic feature - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation within 61 cm (24 inches) of the soil surface. The C horizon indicated carbonates beginning at 140 cm (55 inches) so the C horizon was split into C1 and C2 at 140 cm (55 inches).\nSince the typical pedon was described and sampled, a cellular phone tower has been installed in close proximity to the site. The actual TP site may still be undisturbed but there are various electrical cables buried in the vicinity and the telephone company does not want anyone digging in the area. Therefore, John Lucassen moved the type location about 300 feet east and 715 feet south of the original site in the same map unit. The new profile was essentially the same as the old so he did not redescribe but did bore it to 203 cm (80 inches).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
