  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. Other series in closely related families are Korobago and Nebago. Korobago soils have carbonates at a shallower depth and are coarse-loamy over clayey. Nebago soils have carbonates at a shallower depth and are sandy over clayey."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fisk soils are on glacial lake basins and on terraces of streams and lakes. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in a mantle of sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits and in the underlying silty or loamy outwash or lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 737 mm (25 to 29 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brems, Keowns, Morocco, Nebago, Salter, and Yahara soils. Moderately well drained Brems soils are on higher landscape positions and somewhat poorly drained Morocco soils are on similar landscape positions. Both are sandy to depths of 102 cm (40 inches) or more. Poorly drained Keowns soils are in nearby depressional areas; somewhat poorly drained Yahara soils are on similar landscape positions; and well drained and moderately well drained Salter soils are on higher terraces. All three do not have the sandy surface deposits and are coarse-loamy. Somewhat poorly drained Nebago soils are on similar landscape positions, but are sandy over clayey."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high to very high (42.34 to 141.14 micrometers per second) in the sandy mantle and moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loamy deposits. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and moderate in the loamy deposits. This soil has an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 31 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) for some time in most years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil are used for cropland or woodland. Common crops are corn, soybeans, small grain, and hay. A small acreage is used for pastureland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forests. Common trees are white pine, red maple, and sugar maple."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Fisk soils were formerly mapped as inclusions in the Rimer series in Winnebago County. The soils of this series are arenic, but subgroup of Aquic Arenic Dystric Eutrudepts is not provided for in Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - 0 to 23 cm cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); cambic horizon - 61 to 99 cm (24 to 39 inches) (2Bw2, 2Bg1, 2Bg2);  dystric feature  no carbonates within 102 cm (40 inches) of the soil surface; aquic feature - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation within 61 cm (24 inches) of the soil surface. The C horizon indicated carbonates beginning at 140 cm (55 inches) so the C horizon was split into C1 and C2 at 140 cm (55 inches).\nSince the typical pedon was described and sampled, a cellular phone tower has been installed in close proximity to the site. The actual TP site may still be undisturbed but there are various electrical cables buried in the vicinity and the telephone company does not want anyone digging in the area. Therefore, John Lucassen moved the type location about 300 feet east and 715 feet south of the original site in the same map unit. The new profile was essentially the same as the old so he did not redescribe but did bore it to 203 cm (80 inches).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
