The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 48 to 52 degrees F.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 14 to 30 inches.  Reaction ranges from medium to moderately acid through neutral.  Depth to the apparent water table is 24 to 60 inches during late winter and early spring.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist, 2 or 3 dry.
