    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frycanyon soils are on terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed in the surface layers.  Elevation ranges from 2,200 to 2,400 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 28 to 32 inches and average annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."

Porthill soils are on terraces and have Bt horizons with more than 35 percent clay.  Rubson soils are on terraces and do not have Bk horizons."
