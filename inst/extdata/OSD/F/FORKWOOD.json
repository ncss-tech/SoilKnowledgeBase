The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos/cm throughout the profile.  Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  A vesicular crust occurs on some pedons.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has 3 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or clay loam.  This horizon has 1 to 14 percent authigenic calcium carbonate accumulation.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.

Balon soils are noncalcareous.  Blancot soils have discontinuous horizons of carbonate accumulation.  Bowbac, Cerrillos, Cushman, Gaddes, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Pokeman, Pugsley, Spangler and Threetop soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Buckle and Palacid soils have sola more than 40 inches thick.  Cambria soils have Bt horizons that have a base at less than 10 inches from the soil surface.  Cerrillos, Potts and Spenlo soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder throughout the profile.  Decolney, Hiland, Olney and Penistaja soils have more than 35 percent fine sand and coarser in the particle-size control section. Doakum soils have average annual soil temperature of 52 to 56 degrees F.  Hagerwest, Mentmore and Quagwa soils are driest during May and June.  Los Alamos soils have pumice and ash at depths of 20 to 50 inches.   Oelop, Palacid and Yenlo soils are moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section for 60 consecutive days following July 15 and are moist in some parts for at least 90 cumulative days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F.  Redpen soils have hue of 2.5YR.  Sundance and Teckla soils have lithologic discontinuities."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Forkwood soils are on terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, hills, ridges and pediments.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in slopewash alluvium derived from interbedded shales and argillaceous sandstone.  Elevations are 3,500 to 6,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches with over half of the annual precipitation falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 51 degrees F. The estimated frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."

Cushman and Shingle soils are on shoulder slopes and summits of hills and ridges.  Shingle soils have bedrock at a depth of 4 to 20 inches.  Absted, Arvada, Hiland and Kishona soils occur on similar landscape positions as the Forkwood soils.  Absted and Arvada soils have natric horizons.  Haverdad and Kishona soils lack an argillic horizon.  Haverdad soils occur on flood plains and terraces."
