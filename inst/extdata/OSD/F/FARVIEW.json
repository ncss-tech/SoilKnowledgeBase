  "OVERVIEW": "The Farview series consists of very shallow, well drained and somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, and residuum and eolian material derived from sandstone.  Farview soils are on summits of mesas and structural benches, and on dipslopes of cuestas. Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The mean annual precipitation is typically 10 to 13 inches, but some areas are as low as 8 or 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.
