They formed in alluvium and eolian material derived dominantly from Cretaceous sandstone. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 4,900 to 6,900 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 10 to 13 inches, but some areas are as low as 8 or 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

Beclabito soils are deep with natric horizons on toeslopes intermingled with Farview soils. Doakum and Snapill soils are deep with argillic horizons on open mesa and plateau summits. McElmo soils are deep with natric and calcic horizons on cuesta dipslopes. Sanostee soils are moderately deep with argillic and calcic horizons on adjacent toeslopes."
