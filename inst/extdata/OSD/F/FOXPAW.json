  "OVERVIEW": "The Foxpaw series consists of very deep, poorly drained, soils in depressions and drainageways on moraines and end moraines. They formed in loamy till. Permeability is moderate. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

These soils form a drainage sequence with the Foxpaw soils. Where the tills are finer textured, Wakefield can be in the moderately well drained position.  In bedrock controlled landscapes, Michigamme, Dishno, Peshekee, and Porkies may occupy higher positions.  Other poorly drained coarse-loamy waterworked till soils often found in complexes are Pleine soils where a histic epipedon is present."
