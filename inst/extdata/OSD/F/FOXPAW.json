Cobble and gravel content ranges from 5 to 20 percent throughout.\nSome pedons have an A horizon, it ranges from 1 to 8 inches thick, with hue of 5 YR or 7.5 YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 2. It is loam or sandy loam or the cobbly analogs.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is loam, sandy loam or loamy sand or the cobbly analogs.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the cobbly and gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 31 to 34 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 100 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from 1140 to 1700 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Schweitzer, moderately well drained Gogebic, and the somewhat poorly drained Tula soils. These soils form a drainage sequence with the Foxpaw soils. Where the tills are finer textured, Wakefield can be in the moderately well drained position.  In bedrock controlled landscapes, Michigamme, Dishno, Peshekee, and Porkies may occupy higher positions.  Other poorly drained coarse-loamy waterworked till soils often found in complexes are Pleine soils where a histic epipedon is present."
