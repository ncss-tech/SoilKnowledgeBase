  "OVERVIEW": "The Fleak series consists of excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous soft sandstone.  These soils are shallow to soft sandstone.  These soils are on crests of hills and ridges, and on valley sides.  Slope ranges from 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 14 inches.",
