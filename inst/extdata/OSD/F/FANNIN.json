  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 45 inches. Depth to lithic or paralithic contact is more than 60 inches. Content of coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the A and C horizons and from 0 to 25 percent in the B horizons. Fragments are dominantly gravel in most pedons but cobbles are dominant in some pedons. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid. Content of flakes of mica is common or many in the surface layer and upper B horizon and is many in the lower B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Where value is 3 or less, this horizon is less than 7 inches thick.\nThe E or AB horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It has the same texture as the A horizon in slightly eroded pedons.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles, if they occur, are in shades of red, yellow, or brown. The Bt horizon is loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon is similar in color to the Bt horizon. It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is similar in color to the BC horizon or is multicolored. It is saprolite weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks having a high content of mica such as mica gneiss and mica schist. It has a texture of loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The series is the only other series in this family. The Brownwood, Cashiers, Chandler, Lauada, Manor, Micaville and  Watauga series. Watauga soils have Bt horizons of 7.5YR or yellower hues. Brownwood, Cashiers, Chandler, and Micaville soils do not have an argillic horizon. Lauada and Brownwood are moderately deep and Micaville is deep to a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fannin soils are gently sloping to very steep and are on ridges and side slopes in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). They formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and is weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks having a high content of mica such as mica gneiss and mica schist. . Slopes range from 6 to 95 percent. Elevation ranges from about 1,400 to 3,500 feet. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual rainfall ranges from 45 to 65 inches."

Brevard, Saunook, Tate, Thunder, and Tusquitee formed in colluvium, have less mica, and are in coves. Brownwood, Cashiers, Chandler, Chestnut, Clifton, Cowee, Edneyville, Evard, Lauada, Micaville, and Watauga soils are on ridges and side slopes. In addition, the moderately deep Chestnut and the very deep Edneyville soils contain less mica and have a cambic horizon. The moderately deep Cowee and very deep Evard soils contain less mica. Clifton and Hayesville soils are in a fine particle-size class."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are in forest. Common trees are chestnut oak, scarlet oak, black oak, white oak, hickory, eastern white pine, Virginia pine, and pitch pine. Yellow poplar and northern red oak are common in the northern portions of MLRA 130B. The understory includes flowering dogwood, American chestnut sprouts, flame azalea, blueberry, buffalo nut, mountain laurel, rhododendron, and sourwood. Cleared areas are principally used for pasture and hayland. Small areas are used for growing corn, small grain, truck crops, apples, and Christmas trees."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Fannin series was formerly classified in the Red-Yellow Podzolic great soil group. Available data show that the Fannin soils have average clay content of less than 35 percent in the Bt horizons, average silt content of 20 to 50 percent in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizons, and much mica throughout the sola. These soils feel as if they are higher in silt than mechanical analyses shows them to be. They have a greasy feel caused by the high mica content. The mica is dominantly soft and mineral structure is destroyed by prolonged rubbing.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 8 inches (Oe, A, and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 8 to 33 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and BC horizons)\nHigh content of flakes of mica in the Bt2, BC, and C horizons\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSIR = NC0020, NC0278 (Eroded) MLRA = 130\n01-2011 update:  Classification, competing and associated series, MLRA clarification\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
