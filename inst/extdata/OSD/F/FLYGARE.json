  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon (Pachic feature) - The zone of dark colored soils material from the surface to a depth of 27 inches.  (A1, A2, A3, and A4 horizons)\nArgillic horizon (Pale- feature) - The zone of clay accumulation from a depth of 36 to 70 inches.  (Bt, BCt1, and BCt2 horizons)\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy:  Classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998\nThe activity class is presumed based on the general trend of other soils in the area. At the lower end of the range of annual precipitation, these soils are bordering a xeric moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available: correlation sample number 60 Utah 26-56-1-9, lab numbers U611714-U611719 and U621640-43.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
