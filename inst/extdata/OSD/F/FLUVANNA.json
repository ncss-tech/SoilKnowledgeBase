The distribution of the series has more acreage in the thermic temperature regime, therefore it is now thermic (2007).  The soils in the thermic area are also very deep to soft bedrock.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 1 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 5 to 55 inches (Bt horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: (VPI&SU Publication)\nData Map Unit ID (type Location): 89076\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5 Soil Name Slope Airtemp Frfr/Seas Precip Elevation\nVA0007 FLUVANNA 0- 25 45- 70 180-220 35- 50 250- 700\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nVA0007 NONE          6.0-6.0              -     60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nVA0007  0- 9  FSL L SIL               0-  0  80-100  5-27    -\nVA0007  0- 9  SICL CL                 0-  0  80-100 27-40    -\nVA0007  9-46  C SIC SICL              0-  0  95-100 35-65    -\nVA0007 46-60  CL SICL GR-CL           0-  5  45-100 20-40    -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
