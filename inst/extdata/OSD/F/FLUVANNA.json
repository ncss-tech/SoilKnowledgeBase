The distribution of the series has more acreage in the thermic temperature regime, therefore it is now thermic (2007).  The soils in the thermic area are also very deep to soft bedrock.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 1 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 5 to 55 inches (Bt horizons)"
