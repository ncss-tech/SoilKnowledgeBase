The soil\nis strongly acid or moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and\ndry.  The surface texture is modified by 2 to 10 percent surface stones.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 moist and dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist\nand dry.  It is sandy loam or loam modified by 15 to 35 percent gravel.  In some pedons the upper part is\nmodified by volcanic ash, pumice and cinders that range from 35 to 70 percent of volume.\nThe 2Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4\nmoist and dry.  It is loam or silt loam modified by 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments.\nThe 2BC horizon is loam or silt loam with 40 to 60 percent coarse fragments.  It is hard or very hard when dry\nand very firm moist."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in volcanic ash,\npumice, and residuum and colluvium from andesite.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 110 inches\nwith most of it in the form of snow and rain during the winter months.  Mean January temperature is 27 degrees\nF, the mean July temperature is 58 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.  The frost-free\nseason is 110 to 130 days."
