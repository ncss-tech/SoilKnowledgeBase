  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThickness of the reconstructed soil ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments make up 0 to 15\npercent of the volume of the A or Ap horizon, 0 to 25 percent of the C horizon, and 15 to 80 percent of individual subhorizons of the 2C horizon.  They range mostly from 2 mm to 25 cm but include stones and boulders in the 2C horizon.  Rock fragments include shale, siltstone, medium and fine-grained sandstone, and coal.\nThe Ap and C horizons (in topsoil from reconstructed soil material) have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y;  value of 4 or 6; and chromas of 2 to 6.  They commonly are loam or silt loam and less commonly sandy loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam; or channery or shaly analogues of these textures in the lower part of the C horizon.  The Ap horizon is very strongly acid to neutral and the C horizon is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, or are neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 6.  They are shaly to extremely shaly, or channery to extremely channery analogues of silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam.  They are strongly acid to extremely acid."

Bethesda and Fairpoint soils are loamy-skeletal, and in addition Fairpoint soils are nonacid.  Lenzburg, Schuline, Steinauer, and Storden soils are calcareous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:\nFarmerstown soils are on convex summits and slopes of reconstructed landscapes.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in a blanket of loamy \"topsoil\" 20 to 40 inches thick and are underlain by acid unconsolidated regolith (non-toxic mixture of rock fragments and fine earth material) from surface mine operations.  The topsoil consists of a mixture of layers of pre-mined soils excavated prior to surface mining, and typically has compacted layers or traffic pans that formed during hauling and grading of the soil material.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 37 to 43 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:\nThese are the Coshocton, Gilpin, Rigley, and Westmoreland soils on unmined upland landscapes.  The deep, moderately well drained Coshocton soils; and the deep, well drained Westmoreland soils have a fine-loamy argillic horizon and are formed in residuum from shale, sandstone, and siltstone.  Coshocton and Westmoreland soils are on summits, side slopes, benches, and foot slopes. The\nmoderately deep, well drained Gilpin soils have a fine-loamy argillic horizon and are formed in residuum weathered from interbedded siltstone, shale, and sandstone.  The deep, well drained Rigley soils have a coarse-loamy argillic horizon and are formed in residuum from sandstone.  Gilpin and Rigley soils are on summits, shoulders, and side slopes."
