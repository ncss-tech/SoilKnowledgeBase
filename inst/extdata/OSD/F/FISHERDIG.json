  "OVERVIEW": "The Fisherdig series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Fisherdig soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

They formed in alluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks such as andesite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,530 meters.  The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
