  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fisherdig soils are on fan remnants.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  They formed in alluvium derived mainly from volcanic rocks such as andesite with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,950 to 2,530 meters.  The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
