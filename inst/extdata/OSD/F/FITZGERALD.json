  "OVERVIEW": "The Fitzgerald series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in colluvium and glacial till from mixed sedimentary and igneous rock.  These soils are on mountainsides and have slopes of 8 to 65 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm.",
