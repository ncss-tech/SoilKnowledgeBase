  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The combined thickness of the A, E, and Bt horizons range from 38 to 60 inches.  The upper boundary of the Bt horizon is below 24 inches.  Rock fragments are mainly angular gravel and cobble, but includes stones and boulders in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature at a depth of about 20 inches ranges from 49 to 58 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry in parts of the A, E, and Bt horizons for about 30 days during the summer.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak or moderate, fine to coarse granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges from very gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam or cobbly sandy loam to stony sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam with 20 to 70 percent gravel and cobbles, and up to 5 percent stones.  This horizon has weak medium subangular blocky structure parting to moderate medium granular structure or is single grain.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It ranges from very gravelly sandy clay loam to very stony sandy clay loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam with 50 to 90 percent cobbles and gravel and up to 5 percent stones.  This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky structure.  It ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.  Clay films are few to many, thin to moderately thick on peds and in pores."

Slope gradients are 8 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The climate is humid and the average annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 34 to 40 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is about 55 to 58 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is about 70 to 80 days."

Daybell soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick and lack fines sufficient to fill the voids over 1 mm. in size in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Duchesne soils lack tonguing of the albic horizon into the argillic horizon.  Cluff soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon."
