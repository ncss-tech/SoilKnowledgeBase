  "OVERVIEW": "The Fusulina series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed residuum derived from shale. Fuusulina soils are on mountains. Slopes are 50 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",

The soils formed in residuum derived from shale (Chainman Formation) in a cool, continental climate having a mean annual precipitation of 300 to 460 mm which comes mostly as snow. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free season is less than 50 days."
