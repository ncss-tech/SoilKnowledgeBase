  "REVDATE": "02/2013",
  "STATES": "IA,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Floyd series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 75 to 150 centimeters of loamy sediments and in the underlying till. These soils are on concave foot slopes adjacent to upland drainageways on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 825 millimeters.",
