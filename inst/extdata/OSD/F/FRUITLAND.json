  "OVERVIEW": "The Fruitland series consists of very deep, well drained and somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material and moderately coarse textured alluvium and stream alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Fruitland soils are on stream terraces on valley floors, alluvial fans on valley sides, and summits of mesas, and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
