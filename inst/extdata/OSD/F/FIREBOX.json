  "OVERVIEW": "The Firebox series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from quartzite.  Firebox soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Permeability is moderate over very rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 14inches, and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
