  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils typically are calcareous to the surface but are leached up to 3 inches in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  The particle size control section is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam with 8 to 18 percent noncarbonate clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.   Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  EC ranges from 2 to 4 mmhos.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  The lower values are a result of red carbonates.  When the Bw is absent, the upper part of the Bk horizon typically has a moderate grade of subangular blocky structure to a depth of 10 inches or more.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent of which two-thirds appear to be pedogenic.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon when present has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Authigenic carbonates range from 7 to 25 percent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. Some pedons have a 2Bk or 2C substratum that has gravelly or cobbly modifiers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fiveoh soils are on high alluvial terraces, fan aprons, and broad toeslopes.  These soils formed in mixed, calcareous alluvium derived from sedimentary redbeds.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 6,000 to 7,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches with about half falling as snow and less commonly as rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 110 days."
