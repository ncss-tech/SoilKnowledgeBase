  "REVDATE": "02/2006",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Francis series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands derived from quartzite, gneiss, and granite.  Francis soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nMollic epipedon thickness - 10 to 13 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR, values of 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They have 1 to 3 percent organic matter.\nThe C horizons has hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is dominantly loamy fine sand, but it ranges to fine sand.  In some places the C horizon is slightly to moderately calcareous below 60 inches.  In some pedons the soil is gravelly below depths of 48 inches, and a few pebbles 1/4 to 3/4 inches in diameter are throughout the soil."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the La Posta, Layton, and Wasatch series.\nLa Posta soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Layton soils have horizons with accumulation of secondary carbonates.  Wasatch soils have texture of loamy coarse sand or sand in the particle-size control section, are dominated by medium to very coarse sand grains, and are slightly acid or neutral in reaction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Francis soils are on lake terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  These soils have formed in lacustrine materials that have been reworked by wind.  The materials are derived from quartzite, gneiss, granite, and sandstone and are noncalcareous.  The climate is moist subhumid, with an average annual precipitation from 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is from 68 to 73 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 175 days."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Francis soils are used dominantly as rangeland.  Areas under irrigation are used primarily for orchards, truck crops, and alfalfa.  Much of this soil is being used for homesites.  The native vegetation is mainly sand dropseed, Indian ricegrass, threeawn grass, oakbrush, big sagebrush, rubber rabbitbrush, cheatgrass, sunflowers, and other annual weeds."
