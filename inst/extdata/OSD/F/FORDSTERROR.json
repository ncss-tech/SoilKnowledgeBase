  "OVERVIEW": "The Fordsterror series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from phyllite and schist on hillslopes and mountainslopes.  Slopes range from 35 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is in excess of 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 2 to 17 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 5 to 30 percent with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.  Reaction increases with depth, ranging from extremely acid to slightly acid.  Buried horizons are present in many profiles.\nCombined thickness of the O horizons ranges from 2 to 8 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value from 4 to 8.  Texture is commonly silt loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma from 1 to 3.  Texture is commonly silt loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  Prominent or distinct mottles are present in the lower part of the horizon.\nA mottled Bs horizon is present in some pedons.  Value moist ranges from 3 to 5 and chroma moist from 4 to 6.\nThe C horizon has hue from 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value moist from 3 to 6 and chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is commonly silt loam or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Prominent or distinct mottles are common."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: an albic horizon from 0 to 1 inch;  a spodic horizon from 1 to 14 inches;  cryic temperature regime; assumed organic carbon content of greater than 6 percent in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon; coarse-loamy particle size from 10 to 26 inches.\nThis series could classify as a Typic Cryaquod under the 1991 revised Spodosol criteria.  This soil, however, does not exhibit the saturated conditions typical of an Aquod which is reflected in terms of forest productivity.  Redoximorphic features are present lower in the spodic horizon and the soil exhibits characteristics of somewhat poor drainage.   It is assumed the soil is not saturated to the surface nor does the capillary fringe extend to the surface during the year.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
