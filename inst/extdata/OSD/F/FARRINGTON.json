The particle-size and series control sections average a total of 25 to 65 percent medium, coarse, and very coarse sand; 15 to 35 percent coarse and very coarse sand; and less than 50 percent fine sand or very fine sand.  Volume of gravel typically ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  Redox accumulations are typically throughout the soil below the mollic epipedon.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within a depth of 16 inches or are immediately below the mollic epipedon.  Saturation occurs within a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet at some time in most years.\nThe Ap and A horizon have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Prior to 1995, this soil was mapped as the Watseka series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - 0 to 18 inches (Ap, A, AB); aquic feature - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and aquic conditions immediately below the mollic epipedon in layers with a total thickness of 6 inches or more.\nLab data from pedons with similar parent material and land use indicate that pedons of Farrington soils typically have base saturation of 50 percent or more (by NH4OAc) in all horizons between the mineral soil surface and a depth of 180 cm.  However, it is suspected that the very low CEC in the sandy outwash results in drastic changes in B.S. with the addition of few bases from fertilization in cropland areas.  Farrington soils may classify as Psammentic Haplumbrepts in their natural state."
