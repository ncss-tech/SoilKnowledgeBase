  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The surface mineral horizons range from 16 to 40 inches thick.  The underlying organic horizons range from 8 to more than 52 inches thick.  The soil ranges from extremely to strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.  The underlying mineral horizons of some pedons may be moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture of the Ap or upper A horizon is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or mucky loam.  The lower A horizon is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Oa horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 5Y or are neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 4.  The organic material ranges from weak blocky structure in the upper layers to massive in the lower layers.  Stumps, logs, and fragments of charcoal are common throughout the 2Oa horizons of most pedons.\nThe 3Cg horizons are stratified grayish or greenish sands, loamy sands, and sandy loams."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fortescue soils are on nearly level surfaces of 0 to 2 percent around large lakes in the lower Atlantic Coastal Plain.  They formed in silty lacustrine sediments deposited over organic material.  Elevations range from 1 to 10 feet above sea level.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 61 to 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 50 to 54 inches near the type location."

Belhaven, Ponzer, and Scuppernong soils have organic material at the surface and are located on slightly lower landscapes.  Engelhard, Hydeland, Pasquotank, and Weeksville soils are mineral soils but lack buried organic horizons. In addition, Englehard, Pasquotank, Weeksville and Wysocking soils are coarse-silty."

Natural vegetation consists of mixed hardwood species.  The common species are sweetgum, (Liquidambar styraciflua), red maple (Acer rubrum), yellow-poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera), southern baldcypress (Taxodium distichum), willow oak (Quercus phellos), water oak (Quercus nigra), and sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils would have been classified as Alluvial in the 1938 classification.  They were formerly mapped as a phase of the Hyde series.  These soils are tentatively classified in the fine-silty family since a strongly contrasting particle-size class of fine-silty over muck is not recognized in soil taxonomy.  These soils would be Thapto-Histic if such a subgroup was provided under Humaquepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in the typical pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 26 inches (Ap and A horizons)\nAquic conditions - observed endosaturation from the surface to a depth of 74 inches (all horizons)\nMLRA(s): 153A, 153B\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0124 FORTESCUE   0-  2   61- 64  200-260  50- 54     1-  10\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNC0124 RARE            0-0.1  APPARENT DEC-MAY  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0124  0- 6  L SIL MK-L              0-  0 100-100  7-27   3- 17\nNC0124  6-26  L SIL SICL              0-  0 100-100 18-35   4- 12\nNC0124 26-64  MUCK                    0-  0    -     0- 0  20- 95\nNC0124 64-74  VAR                      -       -      -      -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
