  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 3 inches. (A horizon). Mollic colors are a consequence of the parent material. The organic carbon content is not high enough for a mollic epipedon.\nArgillic horizon: the zone from 3 to 70 inches (Bt and Btk horizons)\nClassification was revised from Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Argiustolls to Fine, mixed, superactive, mesic Aridic Haplustalfs and the type location was moved in February 2001 to better reflect the series concept. Lab data indicated too little organic carbon for a mollic epipedon. It is assumed that the dark colors are lithochromic.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999. Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th Edition, 2010.\nUpdate and revisions for the correlation of Chinle Area (AZ713), August 2011, LJG2\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL NM-031-005\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
