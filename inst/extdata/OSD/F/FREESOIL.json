The moderately well drained Fern and Perrinton soils are also associated. The Perrinton soils are loamy throughout and the Fern soils are sandy over loamy. The somewhat poorly drained Pipestone soils are sandy throughout and the Wixom soils are sandy over loamy."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 20 cm (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 20 to 127 cm (Bw horizon).\nAquic conditions: iron depletions and reduced matrix below a depth of 20 cm (Bw and Cg horizons).\nA phase with a surface layer of human transported materials has been correlated.  This layer is less than 50 cm thick and of variable textures.\nA dense substratum phase is recognized.\nAreas of this soil in Michigan (St. Clair, Genesee, Macomb, Isabella and Livingston Counties) were previously correlated as Minoa (Coarse-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Dystric Eutrudepts). All of these areas contain carbonates at depths less than 100 cm and are within the range of the Freesoil series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record: MI0618.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
