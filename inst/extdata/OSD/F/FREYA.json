  "OVERVIEW": "The Freya series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy lacustrine deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle and extremely slow or very slow in the clayey deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
