    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 60 to 100 inches.  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to clay ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Volume of gravel is less than 1 percent throughout the pedon, except for the Bt horizons, which range from 0 to 5 percent gravel.  Depth to free carbonates range from 50 to 70 inches.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface and subsurface layer but ranges to neutral where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the sandy subsoil and ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the upper part of the clayey subsoil and is moderately alkaline in the lower part of the clayey subsoil and in the substratum.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and aquic conditions are within 30 inches of the soil surface.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizons has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  The upper boundary of this horizon is within 40 inches of the soil surface.  It is loamy fine sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a Bw' directly below the Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bw horizon described above.\nThe 2Btg or 2Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y and value of 4 or 5.  Chroma is 1 or 2 in the 2Btg and 3 to 6 in the 2Bt. The 2Btg or 2Bt horizons have a texture of clay.\nThe 2Btkg or 2Btk horizon has color and texture like the 2Btg and 2Bt horizons described above.\nThe 2Cg or 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y and value of 4 or 5.
