  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development is 32 to 64 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches, and extends into the B horizon in many pedons.  Depth to the loamy 2B horizon is 24 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section (slackwater sediments) averages 45 to 60 percent clay.  The lower part of the particle-size control section (loamy alluvium) contains less clay and more sand than the upper slackwater sediments.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  These soils typically do not have carbonates within the series control section, but some pedons contain carbonates in the loamy or sandy alluvium.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap and A) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture typically is silty clay loam or silty clay but includes clay in some pedons.  Clay content averages 35 to 60 percent and sand content is less than 10 percent.\nSome pedons have an AB or a BA horizon.\nThe second part of the control section (B horizon that formed in slackwater sediments) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture typically is silty clay or clay, but some subhorizons are silty clay loam or clay loam with more than 35 percent clay.  Sand content is less than 15 percent. Faces of many peds commonly are shiny or glossy and exhibit slickensides or pressure faces.  Typically, they are grayish colored and have low chroma.\nThe third part of the control section (2B horizon that formed in loamy alluvium) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2. Redoximorphic masses of iron accumulation typically have redder hue or higher chroma than the matrix.  Some subhorizons contain low-chroma clay films or pressure faces. The 2B horizon typically is stratified, and is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam, and averages 15 to 35 percent clay.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon.\nThe lower part of the control section (2C) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is stratified.  Individual strata range from silty clay loam to very fine sand.  Clay content ranges from less than 5 percent to about 30 percent and sand content ranges from about 10 to 95 percent."

Carlow, Chequest, Kings, and Streator soils contain more than 30 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section (B and C horizons).  Marcus and Woodbury soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 56 degrees F.  Titus soils average less than 35 percent clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fults soils are on nearly level or gently undulating flood plains of major rivers.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in 24 to 40 inches of slackwater sediments and in the underlying stratified loamy or sandy alluvium.  These soils typically are subject to frequent flooding, but some areas are subject to only occasional or rare flooding because of levees, locks and dams, or other flood-control structures.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 210 days, and elevation is 340 to 450 feet above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ambraw, Booker, Darwin, Gorham, Landes, and Nameoki soils.  The poorly drained Ambraw and Gorham soils contain less clay in the upper part of the series control section and occur on similar landforms nearby.  The poorly drained Booker and Darwin soils formed entirely in slackwater sediments and are on lower and less undulating parts of the flood plain nearby.  The well drained Landes soils contain more sand and less clay in the upper part of the solum and are on higher parts of the flood plains nearby.  The somewhat poorly drained Nameoki soils are on slightly higher parts of the undulating flood plain.  They form a hydrosequence with the Fults soils."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained.  Runoff is slow or ponded.  Permeability is very slow in the upper part of the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy or sandy alluvium in the lower part of the solum and the substratum.  In drained areas, depth to an intermittent apparent high water table is 0.5 foot above the surface to 1 foot below from November to May in most years.  An undrained phase is recognized."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The type location was moved from Randolph County, Illinois to Monroe County with this revision.  The family classification was changed from clayey over loamy, montmorillonitic, mesic to fine, smectitic, mesic based on lab data from several pedons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include: Mollic epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (Ap and A horizons).  Cambic horizon - from a depth of 12 to 42 inches (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, 2Btg4, and 2Btg5 horizons).  Aquic conditions - endosaturation and reduction indicated by redoximorphic features (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, 2Btg4, 2Btg5, and 2Cg horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lab data for the typical pedon (S79IL-133- 033) and several other supporting pedons are on file at the USDA/NRCS state office in Champaign, Illinois.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
