  "OVERVIEW": "The Figaro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and slope alluvium.  They are on alluvial fans, footslopes, mountains and hills.  Slopes are 8 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
