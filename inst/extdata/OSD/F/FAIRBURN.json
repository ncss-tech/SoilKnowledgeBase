The EC ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos/cm throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, or silt loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have up to 30 percent by volume of rock fragments.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam or silt loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have Bw horizons less than 6 inches thick with properties similar to the AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 8 and 3 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam or silt loam. Fragments of siltstone or mudstone ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.

Dolcan soils occur at elevations above 6,200 feet and have precipitation that is distributed evenly throughout the year. Menefee soils have Bw horizons more than 6 inches thick.  Mittenbutte soils contain less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Sipapu and Spearfish soils have hues of 7.5YR or redder below the A horizon.  In addition, Sipapu soils have more than 15 percent pararock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fairburn soils are on gently sloping to very steep upland hills and ridges.  Slopes generally are convex and range from 3 to 60 percent.  The soil formed in residuum weathered from siltstone, very fine-grained sandstone, shale or mudstone.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 50 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches, most of which occurs in the spring and early summer.  Elevation ranges from 2,600 to 5,800 feet.  Frost-free period ranges from 105 to 150 days."

In addition, the Blackpipe, Metre and Wortman soils have a mollic epipedon.  They are on less sloping parts of the landscape below the Fairburn soils.  Orella soils are on similar parts of the landscape as the Fairburn soils.  Orella soils have a fine textured control section."
