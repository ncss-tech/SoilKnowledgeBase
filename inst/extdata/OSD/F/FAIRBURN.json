  "STATUS": "Established Series",

  "REVDATE": "04/2002",
  "STATES": "NE,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fairburn series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained and well drained soils on gently sloping to very steep upland hills and ridges.  They formed in residuum weathered from mudstone, very fine-grained sandstone, siltstone or shale.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
