  "OVERVIEW": "The Fuertes series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in fine-loamy alluvium derived from derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist. Fuertes soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
