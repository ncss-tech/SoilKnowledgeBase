  "OVERVIEW": "The Faycreek series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from granitic rock.  Faycreek soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches (300 cm) and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F. (12 degrees C.)",
