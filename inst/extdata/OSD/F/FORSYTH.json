  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mantle of volcanic ash is 7 to 14 inches thick.   Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.   Rock fragments average from 50 to 85 percent throughout the control section, including rounded pebbles, cobbles, and occasional stones.  The volcanic ash influence is 7 to 14 inches with an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15 bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent.   Pumice fragments average from 5 to 20 percent throughout, and most are rounded and bleached.   Some pedons have 3 to 5 percent stones on the soil surface and a few boulders.  Some pedons have rounded cobble and stone-size pumice fragments on the surface. Soil reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 30 percent pebbles and 20 to 30 percent cobbles.  Pumice fragments range from 0 to 10 percent and may be bleached.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam and is gravelly, very gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 40 percent pebbles and 10 to 40 percent cobbles.  Pumice fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly, extremely stony, or extremely cobbly sand.  It is single grain or massive.  Rock fragments range from 30 to 40 percent pebbles and 15 to 40 percent cobbles.  Pumice fragments range from 5 to 20  percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Forsyth soils are on terraces, fans, and terrace escarpments at elevations of 1,600 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  These soils  formed in slightly compact lahar from Mt. St.  Helens or material from the pyroclastic flow ash cloud (nue'e ardente) deposited during the 350-year-old Kalama eruptive period.  A thin mantle of volcanic ash and pumice, including the 176-year-old layer T, overlies this material.  The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 110 to 130 inches, including snowfall.  Average January temperature is about 20 degrees F; average July temperature is about 61 degrees F; and the average annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The growing season is 120 to 140 days."

Bannel soils formed in layers of aerially deposited ash and pumice and have an ashy control section.  Cinnamon soils formed in layers of volcanic ash and pumice and are ashy over medial. Pinchot, St. Helens, and Shoestring soils formed in layers of ash and pumice more than 14 inches thick over lahar or pyroclastic flow ash cloud deposits.  Pinchot soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are mesic.  St.  Helens soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal. Shoestring soils are medial over sandy or sandy-skeletal and cryic. Swift soils are cindery over medial-skeletal."
