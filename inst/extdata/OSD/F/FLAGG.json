    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bertrand, Blackhammer, Camden, Dodge, Dubuque, Fayette, Greenridge, Hackers, Jackson, Jemerson, Knowles, La Farge, Lambeau, Lomira, , Martinsburg, Menfro, , Middletown, Navlys, Palermo, Palsgrove, Pepin, Piscasaw, Ridgway, Rozetta, Ruma, Rush, Russell, Seaton, St. Charles, Stookey, Sylvan, Thebes, and Yellowriver series. Bertrand, Camden, Hackers, Jackson, Ridgeway, St. Charles, and Thebes soils contain more sand in the lower sola and are stratified in the lower B horizons and C horizons. Blackhammer soils commonly have more chert and sandstone rock fragments in the lower part of the solum. Dodge, Russell, and Yellowriver soils have thinner sola and do not have 2Bt horizons formed in paleosols. Dubuque, Knowles, La Farge, Palsgrove, and Pepin soils have a lithic contact within the series control section. Fayette, Jemerson, Menfro, Navlys, Palermo, Rozetta, Seaton, and Stooky soils contain less sand in the lower part of the sola and are formed in loess. Greenridge soils have hues yellower than 10YR in the 2Bt horizons. Lambeau, Lomira, Middletown, and Rush soils have coarser textures in the lower part of the solum and underlying material.  Martinsburg soils have thicker E horizons.  Piscasaw soils average more than 20 percent clay in the 2C horizons.  Ruma soils have finer textures in the lower part of the solum and underlying material."

These soils formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loess and late Sangamon paleosols formed in sandy loam, loam, or clay loam Illinoian till. Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual temperature is between 7.2 to 13.9 degrees C (45 and 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches)."
