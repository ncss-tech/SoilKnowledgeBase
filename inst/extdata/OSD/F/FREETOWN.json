  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic material extends to a depth of 130 centimeters or deeper.  Cumulative layer of hemic materials comprise less than 25 centimeters and fibric materials less than 12 centimeters of the subsurface and bottom tiers.  Woody fragments are in some part of the profile or throughout the profile in most pedons and comprise up to 25 percent of some horizons.  Fragments consist of twigs, branches, logs, or stumps and are 1 centimeter to more than a 30 centimeters in diameter.  Wood fragments are firm but break abruptly under pressure.  Reaction is less than 4.5 in 0.01 molar calcium chloride throughout the control section.\nThe surface tier has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 through 3.  It is dominantly sapric material; however, in some pedons it has various proportions of both sapric and hemic materials.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky structure; or it has moderate medium platy structure; or it is massive.\nThe subsurface tier has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 4.  Redoximorphic features occur in some pedons.  Chroma or value or both may change from 0.5 to 2 units upon rubbing.  Broken faces become darker upon brief exposure to air.  The subsurface tier is dominated by sapric material with a rubbed fiber content of less than 16 percent of the organic volume.  It has granular, subangular blocky or platy structure, or it is massive.  It is very friable or friable. Unrubbed organic material resembles herbaceous and woody plant tissue.\nThe bottom tier has colors similar to the subsurface tier.  It is typically massive although some pedons have platy or subangular blocky structure.  It is very friable or friable.  Unrubbed organic material has variable amounts of woody and herbaceous plant tissues."

Lumley soils have less than 813 millimeters of mean annual precipitation in the upper part of the surface tier during July and August and have fibric material in the upper part of teh surface tier. Pangborn soils formed in areas with a marine climate and have a difference in mean summer temperature and mean winter temperature of less than 9 degrees Celsius.  Puckum soils formed in nonglaciated areas and have a mean annual temperature of more than 10 degrees Celsius."

These bogs are on lake plains, outwash plains, till plains and moraines and alluvial plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees Celsius.  Mean annual precipitation is 1016 to 1270 millimeters.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."

Swansea soils are on similar landforms and have less than 130 centimeters of organic material.  The excessively drained Hinckley and Windsor soils and the very poorly drained Scarboro are on associated outwash landforms.  The somewhat poorly and poorly drained Ridgebury and very poorly drained Whitman soils are on adjacent till landforms."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were previously mapped in Massachusetts as Cranberry bog, Medisaprists, and Muck and in some areas as Carlisle soils.\nThe upper 10 to 25 centimeters of the surface tier is sand or coarse sand in some pedons where agricultural practices, e.g, cranberry operations, may manipulate the surface.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Sapric materials - the zone from 5 cm. to 165 cm is composed dominantly of sapric material (Oa1, Oa2, Oa3, Oa4, and Oa5 horizons)\n2.  Dysic reaction class - the zone from 0 to 130 cm. has reaction of less than 4.5 (in 0.01 M CaCl2) (Oe, Oa1, Oa2, Oa3, Oa4, and Oa5 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
