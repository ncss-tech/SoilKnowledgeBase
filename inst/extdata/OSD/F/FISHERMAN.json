    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy A and C horizon is greater than 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through mildly alkaline.  Shell fragments are usually absent, but content ranges to 15 percent.  Silt plus clay in the control section is less than 5 percent.\nThe 0 horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 3.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 4 or 6.  The lower part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 through 8, and chroma of 0 through 4.  Low chroma mottles are between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  It is coarse sand, sand, or fine sand.\nBuried horizons are in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  In the past, Fisherman soils have been included in the Corolla soils, Dune land, Coastal beach, and Norfolk fine sand.  The absence of pedogenic subsurface horizons, the presence of a udic moisture regime, sandy particle size class to a depth of one meter, and mixed mineralogy are the main diagnostic features of these soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University soil survey laboratory data shows less than 5 percent silt plus clay and mixed mineralogy for the typical pedon and 6 other profiles.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nVA0224 FISHERMAN   0-  6   57- 65  200-240  25- 60     0-  25\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nVA0224 RARE   COMMON 1.5-3.0  APPARENT JAN-DEC  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nVA0224  0- 6  COS S FS                0-  0  75-100  0-10    -\nVA0224  6-85  COS S FS                0-  0  75-100  0- 5    -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
