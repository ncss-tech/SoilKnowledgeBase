Coxlake soils are somewhat poorly drained, have a xeric soil moisture regime and mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F. Deerspring soils are moderately well drained and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Endersby soils are slightly or moderately alkaline in the C horizon and have 50 to 80 percent rock fragments below 40 inches. Evans soils have a particle-size control section with loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam textures and a xeric soil moisture regime. Lapwai soils have calcium carbonates at 30 to 40 inches and greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower particle-size control section. Leavenworth soils are moderately well drained and have a xeric soil moisture regime. Narcisse soils are moderately well drained with redoximorphic features between 30 and 40 inches, have a xeric soil moisture regime and mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F. Okanogan soils have 15 to 30 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section and a xeric soil moisture regime. Patit Creek soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section and a xeric soil moisture regime. Pleasant View soils have Bk horizons and a xeric soil moisture regime. Plinco soils are moderately well drained with redoximorphic features between 40 and 60 inches and have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 50 degrees F. Porter soils are moderately well drained with redoximorphic features between 40 and 72 inches. Poween soils are moderately well drained, have calcareous horizons and a xeric soil moisture regime. Redola soils are calcareous throughout. Threecreeks soils are moderately well drained with redoximorphic features in the Bw horizon and have a xeric soil moisture regime.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Flofeather soils are nearly level to moderately steep on flood-plain steps, stream terraces and alluvial fans at elevations of 2,500 to 3,750 feet. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from lacustrine deposits and granitic rocks. Average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches. Average annual temperature ranges from 49 to 51 degrees F. Frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
