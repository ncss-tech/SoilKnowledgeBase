  "OVERVIEW": "The Fontana series is a member of the fine-loamy, mixed, thermic family of Calcic Haploxerolls.  Typically, Fontana soils have dark grayish brown, slightly acid and mildly alkaline, clay loam A horizons and moderately alkaline, yellowish brown, shaly clay loam Cca horizons overlying shale at a depth of 28 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Usually the soil between depths of 5 and 15 inches is moist in some part between early November and mid-May for an average of about 180 continuous days.  It is dry all the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 63 degrees to 68 degrees F. and usually the minimum temperature in winter is not below 47 degrees F.  A few vertical cracks 3/8 to 1/2 inch wide develop upon drying and extend to depths of 16 or 18 inches.  Small pressure faces are present in some pedons.  Organic matter content in the upper 10 inches of the A horizon ranges from 1.0 to 3.0 percent and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent between depths of 10 and 20 inches.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown, grayish brown or brown in 10YR or 2.5Y hue.  It is slightly acid in the upper 10 inches and neutral or mildly alkaline in the lower part.  In some pedons, a calcareous A13 horizon rests directly on the parent material.\nThe Cca horizon is yellowish brown, dark yellowish brown or brown.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam with 5 to 20 percent shale fragments.  Lime is disseminated and in threads, soft concretions, and coats some shale fragments.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 15 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Gazos soils lack free lime in all parts and have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Linne soils are calcareous in all parts and have a chroma of less than 2.  Nacimiento soils are calcareous throughout.  San Benito soils have a paralithic contact 40 to 60 inches below the surface.  Sorrento soils lack a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fontana soils are on hilly, moderately steep to steep uplands with rounded tops at elevations of 900 to 1,600 feet.  They formed in residuum weathered from calcareous shale and fine grained sandstone.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., average January temperature is about 51 degrees F., and average July temperature is about 76 degrees F.  The average freeze-free season is 230 to 290 days."

Alo soils are fine textured, have deep cracks when dry, and intersecting slickenside faces.  Gaviota soils have ochric epipedons and are less than 20 inches deep to hard sandstone."
