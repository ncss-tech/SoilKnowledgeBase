  "OVERVIEW": "The Florita series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in coarse-textured alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Florita soils are on hills and valley sides.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
