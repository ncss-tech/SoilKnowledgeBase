  "OVERVIEW": "The Frines series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from welded tuff.  The Frines soils are on crests of low foothills.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
