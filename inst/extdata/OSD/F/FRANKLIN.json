Some evidence indicates that that proportion of montmorillonite in the loess decreases from Iowa to Indiana and illite increases in proportion.\nClassification to the fine-silty particle-size family is questionable.  Further study is needed to resolve this issue.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nSome pedons have vertical seams or wedges of sand or loamy sand about 5 to 15 centimeters wide and about 0.9 to 1.2 meters deep extending downward from the stone line into the till.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
