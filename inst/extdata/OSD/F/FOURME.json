  "OVERVIEW": "The Fourme series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, limestone, rhyolite and sandstone. Fourme soils are on fan remnants, stream terraces and outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.",
