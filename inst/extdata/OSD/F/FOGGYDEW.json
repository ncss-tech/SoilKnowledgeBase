    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average 50 to 75 percent. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. Depth to a lithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout by sum of cations.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.  It has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 30 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.\nThe 2Bw horizon has a value of  4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of  2 to 4 dry or moist. It is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or extremely cobbly sandy loam. It has 40 to 75 percent gravel, 0 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones."

Borgeau and Louiecreek soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days and have an O horizon.  Brickmill soils are moderately well drained and are saturated above one meter for over 90 consecutive days.  Eaglespring soils are dry for 60 to 90 days and the rock fragments are channers.  Garrison soils have sandy-skeletal material at depths of 24 to 36 inches.  Metmill soils have a mollic epipedon 30 to 60 inches thick and have base saturation of over 75 percent.  Neviot soils have carbonates at 44 to 60 inches.  Raisio and Vanbrunt soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Thuso soils are very deep.  Wagberg soils have a 10 to 18 inch thick mollic epipedon and have developed in glacial material.  Whitestone soils have an O horizon and a 10 to 18 inch thick mollic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Foggydew soils are on backslopes, shoulders, and ridges of mountains, usually with a southerly aspect. They form in colluvium and residuum with a minor component of till, and with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. Slopes are 35 to 75 percent, and elevations range from 1,500 to 4,800 feet. Climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, moist winters, average precipitation is 15 to 18 inches, and the average annual temperature is 47 to 52 F. The frost-free season is 110 to 150 days."

Setill soils are very deep forested soils on backslopes and footslopes. Nicmar soils are on forested backslopes and have a frigid soil temperature regime. Sycreek soils are on gently sloping to steep drainage sideslopes and footslopes, and have a frigid soil temperature regime."
