  "OVERVIEW": "The Foggydew series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium, residuum, and some till from sedimentary and volcanic rock, with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on shoulders, ridges, and backslopes of foothills and mountains. Slopes are 35 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
