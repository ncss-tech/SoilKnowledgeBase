  "OVERVIEW": "The Fortran consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in pyroclastic flow and lahar material.  These soils are on terrace escarpments at elevations of 800 to 1,800 feet.  Slopes are 65 to 120 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about l00 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
