  "OVERVIEW": "The Fritsland series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types.  Fritsland soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
