The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation. Elevations are 1,000 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is about 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 53 degrees F.
