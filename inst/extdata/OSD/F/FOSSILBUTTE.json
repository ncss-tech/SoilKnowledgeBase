  "OVERVIEW": "The Fossilbutte series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from interbedded sandstone and shale. These soils occur on ridges, mesas and buttes. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3.5 degrees C.",
