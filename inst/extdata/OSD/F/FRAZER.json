Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 13 inches (A horizon); a cambic horizon from 13 to 20 inches (Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw and C1 horizons).  Fluventic Haploborolls feature a mollic epipedon less than 16 inches thick; have an irregular decrease in organic carbon from the surface down; may or may not have a cambic horizon.  Frazer soils have an ustic moisture regime and a frigid temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU. S. A."
