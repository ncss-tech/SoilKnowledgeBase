Allegheny soils have water-worn rock fragments within the control section. Allenwoood, Chetwynd, Leck Kill, Shouns, Ungers and Whitford soils have hues of 5YR or redder either throughout or in some part of the control section. Drapermill (T) and Gilwood soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Glenelg soils have rock fragments of quartzite, gneiss and schist and have highly micaceous C horizons within a depth of 40 inches. Lonon soils formed from weathered metasedimentary rock. Murrill soils have a thicker sola and have rock fragments dominated by sandstone. Tate soils have mica flakes within the control section and contains pebbles or cobbles of quartz granite. Cades (T) formed in old alluvium derived from metasedimentary rock. Queponco (T) and Reybold (T) are derived from fluvial and eolian deposits underlain by fluviomarine sediments. Rhodhiss (T) soils formed in acid crystalline rock."
