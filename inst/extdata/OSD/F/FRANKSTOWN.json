    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the top of the argillic horizon ranges from 1 to 8 inches and depth to bedrock is 40 to more than 60 inches. The particle size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Percent coarse fragment content of limestone, siltstone, shale, sandstone or chert ranges from 0 to 25 percent, by volume, in the A and E horizons, 0 to 40 percent, by volume, in the BE, Bt and BC horizons, and 20 to 50 percent, by volume, in the C horizon.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has  hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5 Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt and BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have lithochromic mottles in shades of brown, white, gray, yellow and red.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay or clay, and may be stratified with different colors and textures."

Allegheny soils have water-worn rock fragments within the control section. Allenwoood, Chetwynd, Leck Kill, Shouns, Ungers and Whitford soils have hues of 5YR or redder either throughout or in some part of the control section. Drapermill (T) and Gilwood soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Glenelg soils have rock fragments of quartzite, gneiss and schist and have highly micaceous C horizons within a depth of 40 inches. Lonon soils formed from weathered metasedimentary rock. Murrill soils have a thicker sola and have rock fragments dominated by sandstone. Tate soils have mica flakes within the control section and contains pebbles or cobbles of quartz granite. Cades (T) formed in old alluvium derived from metasedimentary rock. Queponco (T) and Reybold (T) are derived from fluvial and eolian deposits underlain by fluviomarine sediments. Rhodhiss (T) soils formed in acid crystalline rock."
