These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of andic soil material ranges from 7 to 14 inches and it has estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, glass content of 20 percent or more, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.8 to 1.25 percent, phosphate retention of 25 to 40 percent and 15-bar water retention of 3 to 5 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay, 5 to 20 percent rock fragments and 5 to 15 percent pararock fragments.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist. Some pedons have an A2 horizon.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. Texture is loam or gravelly loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has a hue of 2.5Y, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 to 6 dry and moist. Texture is loam, clay loam, or gravelly sandy clay loam. Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent.
