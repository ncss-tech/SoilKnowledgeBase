  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of the argillic and to stratified deposits ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Clay content in the particle size control section ranges from 5 to 18 percent. Redoximorphic accumulations and depletions are throughout the pedon. Saturation occurs at the surface at some time in most years. These soils do not have carbonates. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral throughout.\nSome pedons have an Oa horizon up to 4 inches thick which has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 2.5 and chroma of 1.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is fine sandy loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 2. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and may be stratified with fine sand or loamy sand in some pedons.\nThe 2C, and C horizon where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is mainly stratified loamy fine sand and fine sandy loam but includes strata of fine sand to silt loam. The thickness and sequence of stratified layers are variable."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fenander soils are on glacial lake basins and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Fenander soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. Elevation ranges from 1100 to 1400 feet. The frost-free period ranges from 70 to 125 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained Alban soils, the moderately well drained Aftad soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Plover soils are in a drainage sequence with Fenander soils. The finer textured Barronett and Comstock soils are close associates on some lake plains."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum. The soil has a perched seasonal high water table that ranges from the surface to one foot below the surface at some time during the period from October to June in most years. The water table is perched over stratified lacustrine sediments, but in most years will eventually saturate the lacustrine sediments and exhibit an apparent water table. Surface runoff is low to ponded."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used for pastureland and hayland. Drained areas are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain and alfalfa hay. Natural vegetation consists primarily of sedges and grasses with scattered shrubs, such as alder and willow. In wooded areas vegetation is black ash, quaking aspen, red maple, alder and willow."
