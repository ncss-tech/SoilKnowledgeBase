  "OVERVIEW": "The Fewkes series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, residuum, and colluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone and shale.  Fewkes soils are on hills, fan remnants and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
