  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. The Castile, Farnham, and Trestle series are in related families. The Castile and Farnham soils lack an irregular decrease in organic carbon content with depth and are strongly acid throughout.  The Trestle soils lack redoxymorphic depletions within 24 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Foxville soils are on high terraces along streams in the northern portions of the Blue Ridge province.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent, but are commonly 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from 1100 to 1500 feet. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F., and annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 55 inches.  Stones and boulders typically cover from 15 to 70 percent of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Catoctin, Deposit, Lew, Mt. Zion, Myersville, and Rohrersville series. The Myersville soils are well drained and formed from greenstone residuum. The Lew and Mt. Zion soils are well and moderately well drained respectively, and are formed in colluvium from greenstone. The Catoctin is moderately deep to greenstone bedrock and well drained. The Deposit soils are somewhat poorly drained, and formed in mixed materials derived from sedimentary rocks."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Foxville soils are somewhat poorly drained. Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper subsoil, moderate in the lower subsoil and moderately slow in the substratum.  Foxville soils are generally not subject to flooding.  The potential for surface runoff is high where nearly level and very high where gently sloping."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: This soil is used mainly for forest with limited acreages being used for pasture. Most areas are used for wildlife and limited forms of recreation. This soil has great potential for storm water retention. Common tree species in forested areas are eastern hemlock, red maple, green ash, yellow-poplar, slippery elm, and birch."
