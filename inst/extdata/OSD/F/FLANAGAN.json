Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F); mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1067 mm (34 to 42 inches); frost-free period ranges from 160 to 190 days; and elevation ranges from 174 to 311 meters (570 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Dana and Saybrook soils and somewhat poorly drained Raub soils are on nearby parts of the till plain where loess is thinner than 102 cm (40 inches). The poorly drained and very poorly drained Milford soils are lower on the landscape in lacustrine areas."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow."
