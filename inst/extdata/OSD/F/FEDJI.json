  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates range from 30 to 60 inches.  The depth to the loamy 2B horizon of glacial till or lacustrine sediments ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper sediments lack rock fragments, and the lower sediments contain as much as 8 percent by volume of rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They have textures of loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  The reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bw horizons typically have hue of 10YR, but the hue ranges to 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4 in the upper part, and value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 5 in the lower part.  The Bw horizons have textures of loamy fine sand, sand, fine sand and loamy sand.  The 2Bw horizon typically is loam or clay loam but includes silt loam and silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a 2Bt horizon but it does not meet the requirement for an argillic horizon.  The Bw and 2Bw horizons are moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 5.  It is typically loam or clay loam.  A silty substratum phase has textures of silt loam and silty clay loam.  Calcium carbonate content ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Iron depletions and/or concentrations are typically present in this horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or convex slopes with gradients of 1 to 8 percent on glacial moraines and on the periphery of outwash plains, lake plains, and deltas.  These soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of dominantly sandy sediments and loamy glacial till or lacustrine sediments.  These sediments are from the Des Moines lobe of the Late Wisconsin glaciation.   Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 24 to 30 inches.  Frost free days range from 140 to 170 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1050 to 1250 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The Clarion, Darfur, Fieldon, and Lasa soils are the main ones.  The Darfur and Fieldon soils are poorly drained and are on surrounding flats and drainageways.  The well drained Clarion soils and somewhat excessively drained Lasa soils are on terrain similar to that of the Fedji soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
