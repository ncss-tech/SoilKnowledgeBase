These soils formed in alluvium, glacial meltwater deposits, and in eolian deposits.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and early, hot and dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches most of which falls as rain in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 135 days."
