  "OVERVIEW": "The Floweree series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, glacial meltwater deposits or in eolian deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, till plains, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
