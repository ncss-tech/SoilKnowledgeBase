  "OVERVIEW": "The Firmage series is very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soil that formed in alluvium from limestone and conglomerate. Firmage soils are on alluvial fans and rolling hills.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are dry 45 to 75 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nDepth to the calcic horizon ranges from 7 to 16 inches, and this horizon is 27 to 60 inches thick.  Rock fragments are mostly pebbles and cobbles and range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in the particle size control section. The particle-size control section has 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 4. Textures are gravelly fine sandy loam, very cobbly loam, fine sandy loam, and loam.\nSome pedons have Bw horizons with value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is strongly calcareous or very strongly calcareous.  Textures are a cobbly loam, cobbly sandy loam, gravelly loam, fine sandy loam, loam, clay loam, cobbly clay loam, stony loam and very cobbly sandy clay loam. Reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have C horizons with 15 to 55 percent rock fragments.  Value of 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderate to strongly alkaline."

Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 64 to 66 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches. March, April, and May are the wettest months and June is the driest. Freeze-free period is 100 to 150 days."
