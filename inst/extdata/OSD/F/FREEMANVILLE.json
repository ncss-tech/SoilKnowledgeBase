  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. Depth to horizons with more than 5 percent plinthite ranges from 26 to 50 inches.  Nodules of ironstone range from 10 to 50 percent by volume in the A horizon and from 5 to 35 percent in the B horizon.  Size of the nodules of ironstone ranges from 2 mm to 3 cm.  Reaction is medium acid or strongly acid in the A, E, and BE horizons, except where lime has been added; and is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the Btc and Btv horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  The lower part has this same range in color or is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, and red.  Mottles of chroma 2 or less are below a depth of about 40 inches. Texture is clay, sandy clay, or clay."
