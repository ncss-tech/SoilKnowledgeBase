  "OVERVIEW": "The Frostad series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils formed in glacial drift over dense glacial drift. Frostad soils are in drainageways and  valleys of glacial drift plains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 830 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C",
