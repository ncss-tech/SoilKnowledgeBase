    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Frostad soils are in drainageways and valleys of glacial drift plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in glacial drift over dense glacial drift.  Elevations are 0 to 150 meters.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 450 to 1,000 millimeters.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 10 degrees C."

Frostad soils have a perched water table at or near the soil surface from October to April unless the soil is drained. Frostad soils are subject to frequent ponding for very long durations from December to March and for brief durations during October, November, and April."
