    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil contains as much as 20 percent by volume pebbles, cobbles, and boulders throughout.  Stony and cobbly phases are recognized.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 moist, and chroma of 1.  It typically is loam or clay loam, but the range includes silt loam and silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It averages between 30 and 35 percent clay, but ranges to 40 percent in thin layers or horizons in some pedons.  The B/A clay ratio ranges from 1.2 to 1.3.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline. It has moderate or strong medium or fine prismatic and angular or subangular blocky structure.  Peds in the Bt horizon have common or many, faint or distinct clay films.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are clay loam or loam.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contain both diffuse and segregated carbonates.  Some pedons do not have a Bky horizon.\nSome pedons have a C horizon below the Bk or Bky horizon.  The C horizon where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is clay loam or loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
