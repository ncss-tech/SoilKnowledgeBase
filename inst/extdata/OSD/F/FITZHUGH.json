  "OVERVIEW": "The Fitzhugh series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable upland soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone or sandstone conglomerate of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on very gently sloping or gently sloping convex uplands\nin the Cherokee Prairies.  Slopes are 1 to 5 percent.  Mean\nannual precipitation is 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.",

Bates soils have siliceous mineralogy\nand a solum 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone bedrock.\nCatoosa, Lula, and Mason soils have a fine-silty control section.  Claremore, Collinsville, and Coweta soils have a solum less than\n20 inches thick over bedrock.  In addition, Collinsville and\nCoweta soils do not have argillic horizons and have siliceous mineralogy.  Nowata soils have a loamy-skeletal control section."
