Okay soils have a solum\nmore than 60 inches thick.  Bates soils have siliceous mineralogy\nand a solum 20 to 40 inches thick over sandstone bedrock.\nCatoosa, Lula, and Mason soils have a fine-silty control section.  Claremore, Collinsville, and Coweta soils have a solum less than\n20 inches thick over bedrock.  In addition, Collinsville and\nCoweta soils do not have argillic horizons and have siliceous mineralogy.  Nowata soils have a loamy-skeletal control section."

They formed in material weathered from sandstone or sandstone conglomerate of Pennsylvanian age.  The climate is subhumid or humid.  Mean\nannual precipitation ranges from 34 to 45 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F.   Thornthwaite annual\nP-E indices range from 60 to 80."
