  "OVERVIEW": "The Fort series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed eolian material and alluvium.  Fort soils are on plains, interfluves, fans, fan remnants, and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 millimeters (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
