    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils occur on mountains with slopes of 30 to 110 percent at elevations of 65 to 1272 meters (213 to 4104 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from schist and phyllite. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1524 to 2290 millimeters (60 to 90 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F) and the mean winter temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F). The mean annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C (48 to 59 degrees F).  The frost free season is about 150 to 250 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Darkwoods, Redtop, and Oakside soils. Darkwoods soils have an argillic horizon with increasing clay content with depth and presence of clay films. Redtop soils are fine with greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Oakside soils are 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) to bedrock.  Darkwoods and Redtop soils are generally found on linear to concave slope positions.  Oakside soils are generally found on strongly convex slope positions."
