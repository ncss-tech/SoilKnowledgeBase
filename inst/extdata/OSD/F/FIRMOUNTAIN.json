  "OVERVIEW": "The Firmountain series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from phyllite and schist. Firmountain soils are moderately deep to bedrock with fractures less than 10 centimeters apart. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 110 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1905 millimeters (75 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
