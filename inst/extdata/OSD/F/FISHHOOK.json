    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fishhook soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep parts of dissected Illinoian and Pre-Illinoian till plains. Slope gradients are 2 to 18 percent. These soils formed in 20 to 40 inches (51 to 102 cm) of loess and the underlying till that contains a strongly developed paleosol. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 13.9 degrees C (46 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1067 mm (32 to 42 inches), frost free days range from 170 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 107 to 311 meters (350 to 1020 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Atlas and Coatsburg soils and the well drained Hickory and Ursa soils are downslope. Atlas and Coatsburg soils are shallower to the paleosol and Coatsburg soils have a mollic epipedon. Hickory soils average more than 15 percent sand in the particle-size control section and do not contain a paleosol. Ursa soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. The somewhat poorly drained Blair soils are on similar landform positions but have the major part of their solum formed in water-worked sediments that lie above the till and beneath the Peoria loess. Elco soils are moderately well drained and are on similar landform positions. The moderately well drained Winfield, the well drained Rozetta and Fayette soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Keomah soils formed entirely in loess and are upslope on higher backslopes and shoulders or on crests of summits. The somewhat poorly drained Keller soils have a mollic epipedon, are in biosequence with Fishhook soils, and are on similar landform positions."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second) in the loess and moderately low or moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the till.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 2Bt or 2Btg horizon of the Fishhook soils is the lower part of a modern solum superimposed upon a Sangamon paleosol in the Illinoian or Pre-Illinoian till. Many of the properties of those horizons are believed to be inherited from the paleosol. The variability of the properties is related to the geologic truncation of the paleosol before it was buried by loess, and to the extent of modern soil development in the old materials. Calcium and other bases have been replenished in some pedons after burial by loess through infiltration. It is difficult to differentiate the properties of the lower part of the modern solum from those of the paleosol in many pedons. Some pedons contain a thin layer of loamy pedisediment between the loess and the till.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 CM (6 inches) (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from about 15 CM (6 inches) to a depth of more than 208 CM (82 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, 2Bt6, 2Bt7, and 2Btg horizons); udic moisture regime; mesic temperature regime.\nThis pedon was checked in the field by RDC 5/25/95 and adjustments were made in the description on depth of soil development, colors and redoximorphic features. CLL, RLT.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for different pedons of Fishhook from Brown County and Stephenson County are on file at the NRCS Region 11 MLRA Office, Indianapolis, Indiana.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
