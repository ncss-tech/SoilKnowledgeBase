  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 through 48 inches. Coarse fragments are dominantly shale with 0 through 10 percent erratic pebbles and cobblestones, and total 15 to 60 percent in the A and upper B horizons and from 45 to 75 percent in the lower B and the C horizons. Unless limed, the soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the Ap and in the B horizon and from strongly acid through slightly acid in the C horizon, at depths less than 80 inches. The texture of the fine earth fraction throughout the soil ranges from loam through silt loam.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium, granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6, with redoximorphic depletions of 2 chroma, and with or without redoximorphic accumulations of chroma higher than 2. Structure is very weak through moderate, fine or medium, subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable through firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Consistence is friable or."

Castile soils have coarse fragments dominated by sandstone and siltstone.\nThe Blasdell, Chenango, Ellington, Manlius, and Pompton series are related soils in similar families. Blasdell, Chenango, and Manlius soils lack mottles with chroma of 2 in the B horizon. Ellington and Pompton soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Farnham soils occupy nearly level and gently sloping areas of old alluvial fans, valley trains, and terraces. They formed in water-sorted material dominated by fragments from local shale bedrock. Slope ranges from 0 through 8 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 45 inches; mean frost free period ranges from 120 to 160 days."
