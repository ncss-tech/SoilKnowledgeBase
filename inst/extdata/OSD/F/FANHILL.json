  "OVERVIEW": "The Fanhill series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from gneiss and granitoid rocks. Fanhill soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
