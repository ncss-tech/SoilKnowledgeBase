  "OVERVIEW": "The Freer series consists of poorly drained soils that formed in a silty mantle of loess or lacustrine deposits and dense loamy glacial till on drumlins or moraines.  These soils are moderately deep or deep to dense till (paralithic contact).  These soils have moderate permeability in the silty mantle and very slow permeability in the dense till.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The silty mantle ranges from 15 to 30 inches thick.  Depth to dense till (paralithic contact) is 30 to 45 inches.  Stony phases are recognized in places.  The silty sediments contain 0 to 5 percent rock fragments, the 2B horizons contain 2 to 15 percent, and the 2Cd horizon contains 5 to 20 percent rock fragments by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. The A horizon commonly is silt loam but includes very fine sandy loam or loam high in very fine sand.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3 and typically has mottles.  The E horizon is commonly silt loam, but includes very fine sandy loam or loam high in very fine sand. It is very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe B/E or E/B horizon has the same color and texture ranges as the E and Bt horizon.  The E part occupies 15 percent or more of the matrix.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The Bt horizon commonly is silt loam, or loam high in silt content, but the range includes very fine sandy loam, and fine sandy loam.  The 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  These horizons have faint to prominent mottles.  Bulk density ranges from 1.5 to 1.7 gm/cc.  They are strongly to moderately acid.\nThe 2Btg or 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR; value and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have mottles in this horizon.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Bulk density ranges from 1.7 to 1.9 gm/cc.  They are firm or very firm.  These horizons are somewhat restrictive to root penetration due to the platy structure, which is a property of the dense till, but not as restrictive as the Cd horizon.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR; and value and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogues and is very firm.  It is moderately acid to neutral.  Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc.  It is considered to be a paralithic contact."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 13 inches (A and E horizons); glossic horizon- the zone from approximately 13 to 18 inches (B/E horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 13 to 32 inches (B/E, Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons); the 2Bt3 horizon is considered argillic because of the lithologic discontinuity between the silt and coarser texture; aquic moisture regime based upon dominant chroma of 2 or less on ped surfaces or in matrix of the argillic horizon; aeric feature - has a horizon with chroma too high for typic subgroup due to a shorter saturation period.  The Cd horizon is considered to be a paralithic contact."
