  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The loamy mantle thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to free carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches or more. Volume of rock fragments in the upper sediment ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume and from 0 to 35 percent in the 2C horizon. The rock fragments are of mixed lithology, rounded, and mostly less than 5 cm in diameter. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. Some pedons have redoximorphic features in the A horizon. It is loam, sandy loam or their mucky analogs. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It commonly has redoximorphic features throughout. Some pedons have chroma of 4 due to accumulations of iron. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam but subhorizons in some pedons are sandy clay loam or even loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. It commonly has redoximorphic features. It is sand, loamy sand, coarse sand or gravelly analogs. It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Runeberg soils. However, when previously classified as a Typic Haplaquoll, the competing series were: Adolph, Nokasippi, Parent, Prebish, Runeberg, and Tiffany series. Adolph, Nokasippi, Parent, and Prebish soils all have hues redder than 10YR in the lower part of the series control section and have firm or very firm sandy loam C horizons of glacial till. Tiffany and Runeberg soils do not have 2C horizons of sand or coarse sand within the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Forada soils are on plane or concave positions on outwash plains, stream terraces, and valley trains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in a 20 to 40 inch thick mantle of loamy sediments over sandy and gravelly material. The sediments are late Wisconsinan in age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 33 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 88 to 172 days. Elevation ranges from 670 to 2000 feet above sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Forada is in a hydrosequence with the somewhat excessively drained Arvilla and the moderately well drained Osakis soils. The poorly drained Marysland soils, which have a calcic horizon, are associated in some places."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained. An apparent water table is at depths ranging from .5 to 1.5 feet from October to June in normal years for the poorly drained phase and plus 1 to .5 feet for the depressional phase. Runoff is negligible or very low. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid in the lower part."
