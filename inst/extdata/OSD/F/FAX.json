  "OVERVIEW": "The Fax series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from andesite or quartzite.  Fax soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
