  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to calcium carbonate and sandy materials is 25 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches and extends into the Bw horizon.  The series control section averages between 20 and 30 percent clay and between 15 to 30 percent fine sand or coarser.  Some pedons have from 15 to 30 percent worm casts and worm holes.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam and ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5 hue, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loam or silt loam, but is clay loam in some pedons.  Sandy loam or fine sandy loam layers 5 inches or more thick are in the lower part of the horizon.  It is slightly acid or neutral in the upper part and neutral or slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nSome pedons have a Bk or BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or fine sand.  Fine bands or layers of silt loam, loam and sandy loam are in most pedons.  There are few or common mottles in the 2C horizon.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are loam, silt loam or clay loam below depths of 40 inches.\nThe 3C horizon, when present, has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Distinct or prominent redox features are common or many in most horizons."
