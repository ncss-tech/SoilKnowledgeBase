  "OVERVIEW": "The Flairmont series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvial or debris flow materials from schist, quartzite and phyllite. They are located in mountain drainageways and concave side slopes and backslopes of the Northern Blue Ridge. Permeability is moderately rapid above the fragipan and slow to very slow in the fragipan. Slopes range from 0 to 50. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 16 to 40 inches. Rock fragments of rounded to angular (flat and nonflat) quartzite, schist and phyllite range from channer to boulder size and occupy 35 to 50 percent of the surface, subsurface, and upper subsoil, and 35 to 70 percent in the lower subsoil and substratum. An O horizon is commonly present in varying stages of decomposition and thicknesses that range from 1 to 12 inches or more. In many pedons, flakes of mica are few to common. Surface stoniness ranges from 0.01 to 60 percent or more. The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Textures are loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Some areas of the horizon are thin and discontinuous.\nThe E and/or BE horizon (where present) have a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Textures are loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Textures are sandy loam, loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Redoximorphic features, where present, are similar to the matrix colors but include chromas of 1 or 2.\nThe Btx or Bx horizons (where present) have a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8 . Textures are loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam and clay loam in the fine earth fraction. Redoximorphic features are similar in color to the matrix, but may include a hue of 5YR and chromas of 1 or 2.\nThe C or 2C horizon commonly is variegated with hues of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 8. Some pedons have 2C horizons, mainly in footslope positions. Textures are dominantly sandy loam, loamy sand and loam, but can include sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction."

The Airmont soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section and have a water table closer to the soil surface. The Weverton soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock and average more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. The Dekalb, Hazel, Gunstock, and Stumptown soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock and are well drained. Braddock soils are well drained and average more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Thurmont soils are well drained and are on footslopes, fans and terraces of the Blue Ridge. Bagtown soils average less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Edgemont soils are well drained and occupy mountain ridges and backslopes. Gunnstock and Whiteford soils are well drained and formed in residuum from phyllite and/or slate. Sylvatus soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and formed from phyllite."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Flairmont series replaces a previous loamy-skeletal, moderately well drained concept of the Airmont series (now made fine-loamy and somewhat poorly drained in 2004 by MAV). The name originated out of \"flaggy Airmont\" or Flairmont.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 inches (Oa, A and E horizons)\n2.  Argillic horizon - the zone from 18 to 34 inches (Bt horizon)\n3.  Fragipan - the zone from 34 to 61 inches (Bx1 and Bx2 horizons)\n4.) Lithologic discontinuity - at 61 inches (2C horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
