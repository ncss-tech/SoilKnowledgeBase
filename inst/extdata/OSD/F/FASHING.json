  "OVERVIEW": "The Fashing series consists of soils that are shallow to densic bedrock.  These well drained, slowly permeable, clayey soils are on gently sloping summits and shoulders of ridges.  They have formed in clayey alluvium over thick beds of interbedded mudstone, sandstone and siltstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 736 mm (29 in).",
