  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist. They are moist in parts of the moisture control section for more than 1/2 the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer temperature at 20 inch depth ranges from 68 to 70 degrees F.\nThe mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches thick.  The solum is 40 to 55 inches thick.  Some secondary carbonates occur in veins at depths of 40 to 55 inches. A few pebbles 1/4 to 3/4 inch in diameter are on the surface and at depths below 30 inches.  Cracks 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches wide and extending to depths of over 20 inches occur during the summer when the soil is dry.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline and is 5 to 11 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 but only the upper 6 to 10 inches of the B2t has hue of 10YR and value of 4 dry and 3 moist. It is clay or silty clay loam.  It is 20 to 40 inches thick.  It has common to continuous, thin to thick clay films on faces of peds.\nThe C or Ck horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is moderately to strongly alkaline and is slightly to strongly calcareous at depths below 40 inches."

None of these soils except Battle Creek and Montour crack to depths of 20 inches.  Battle Creek, McMurdie and Gemson soils have a calcic horizon within 40 inches.  Manila soils have a mean annual temperature of less than 47 degrees F.  Montour soils have argillic horizons with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, and have calcic horizons at depths of less than 40 inches.  Nebecker and McMurdie soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Forsgren soils are at elevations of 5,175 to 5,500 feet on gently sloping to moderately steep mountain foot slopes and colluvial fans, and occur just above the highest terrace of old Lake Bonneville.  Slopes are dominantly 10 to 20 percent and range from 1 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone, quartzite and some limestone rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid, with an average annual precipitation ranging form 17 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 66 to 69 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 120 days."
