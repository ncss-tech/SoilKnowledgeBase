The depth to the fragipan ranges from 46 to 97 cm (18 to 38 in). Carbonates are at depths of 152 cm (60 in) or more. Rock fragments (dominantly sandstone but some shale and crystalline rocks) commonly are 0 to 10 percent by volume in the Ap horizon; 0 to 20 percent in the E, BE, Bt, and Btx  horizons; and 2 to 30 percent in the BC and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have A horizons 3 to  13 cm (1 to 5 in) thick that have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap or A horizon commonly is silt loam, and less commonly loam. It is extremely acid to moderately acid. Areas that have been limed range to neutral.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, is up to 30 cm (12 in) thick is in some undisturbed pedons. The Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 (3 if hue is 2.5Y or 5Y). It is silt loam or loam or gravelly analogs. It is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe BEg horizon (or BA horizon, where present) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or loam, or their gravelly analogues. It is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or their gravelly analogues. It is extremely to moderately acid.\nThe Btx and BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. They are loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogues. They are very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly analogues. It is strongly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Frenchtown soils are in depressions, on broad flat areas and base slopes, and along minor natural drainageways on till plains. The slope gradient typically is less than 3 percent, but the range is 0 to 8 percent (see Remarks). The soils formed in Wisconsin and to a lesser extent pre-Wisconsin till strongly influenced by siltstone and sandstone and in places a thin mantle of loess. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 830 to 1320 mm (33 to 52 in), and mean annual temperature ranges from about 6 to 11 degrees C  (47 to 52 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alden, Cambridge, Canfield, Damascus, Holly, Ilion, Luray, Ravenna, Rittman, Sebring, Venango, and Wadsworth soils on nearby landscapes. The very poorly drained Alden soils have a thick, dark surface and do not have a fragipan.  The moderately well drained Cambridge, Canfield, and Rittman soils and the somewhat poorly drained Ravenna, Venango, and Wadsworth soils are in toposequences with Frenchtown soils. All of these soils are on higher landscape positions. Damascus, Luray, and Sebring soils are on nearby terraces. Holly soils are on nearby flood plains. Ilion soils have a darker surface than Frenchtown soils, do not have a fragipan, and typically are in deeper depressions."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and moderately low or low in the fragipan and below. In undisturbed areas the depth to an intermittent perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 ft) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 ft) below the surface from October to June in most years.  Frequent brief and very brief ponding occurs during periods of heavy rainfall and snowmelt."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: About 40,000 acres are correlated with higher slopes. Further study of these soils is needed to determine if they should be recorrelated from the Frenchtown series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of about 30 cm (12 in) (Ap and BEg horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of about 30 to 122 cm (12 to 48 in) (Btg and Btx horizons).\n3. Fragipan - the zone from a depth of about 76 to 122 cm (30 to 48 in) (Btx1, Btx2 horizons).\n4. Redoximorphic features - from the surface to about 168 cm (66 in) (Ap, BEg, Btg1, Btg2, Btx1, Btx2, BC1, BC2 ).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Frenchtown series is located at the NCSS Kellogg Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE and includes pedons analyzed by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
