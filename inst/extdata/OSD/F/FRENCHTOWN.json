  "OVERVIEW": "The Frenchtown series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils typically formed in loamy Wisconsinan age low lime till on plains. Some pedons have a thin mantle of loess. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan and moderately low or low in the fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1065 mm (42 in) and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

The soils formed in Wisconsin and to a lesser extent pre-Wisconsin till strongly influenced by siltstone and sandstone and in places a thin mantle of loess. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 830 to 1320 mm (33 to 52 in), and mean annual temperature ranges from about 6 to 11 degrees C  (47 to 52 degrees F)."

The very poorly drained Alden soils have a thick, dark surface and do not have a fragipan.  The moderately well drained Cambridge, Canfield, and Rittman soils and the somewhat poorly drained Ravenna, Venango, and Wadsworth soils are in toposequences with Frenchtown soils. All of these soils are on higher landscape positions. Damascus, Luray, and Sebring soils are on nearby terraces. Holly soils are on nearby flood plains. Ilion soils have a darker surface than Frenchtown soils, do not have a fragipan, and typically are in deeper depressions."

In undisturbed areas the depth to an intermittent perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 ft) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 ft) below the surface from October to June in most years.

Argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of about 30 to 122 cm (12 to 48 in) (Btg and Btx horizons).\n3. Fragipan - the zone from a depth of about 76 to 122 cm (30 to 48 in) (Btx1, Btx2 horizons).\n4. Redoximorphic features - from the surface to about 168 cm (66 in) (Ap, BEg, Btg1, Btg2, Btx1, Btx2, BC1, BC2 )."
