Zonite and Branham soils have granite bedrock within 10 inches and 20 to 40 inches, respectively, and occur on more convex slope positions of hill and mountain slopes.  Wissikihon soils are sandy throughout most of the control section and have a mollic surface less that 16 inches thick.  Highrye soils have a mollic surface less than 16 inches thick.  Both Wissikihon and Highrye soils can occur on similar landscape positions as the Fleecer series but they tend to occur less often in local concave or otherwise depositional sites."
