Arloval soils have a solum thickness of 6 to 10 inches, commonly noncalcareous in the solum, and are either mildly or moderately alkaline throughout.  Conrad soils have buried A horizons and dominantly have chromas of 1 in the textural control section.  (See Remarks)  Gothenburg soils contain an higher average percentage of coarse fragments and 25 percent or more very coarse and coarse sands in the textural control section.  Heceta soils are non-calcareous throughout.  Junius soils have a solum thickness that ranges from 20 to 40 inches, have B horizons and lack carbonates in the surface 20 inches.  Stafford soil have a solum thickness that ranges from 20 to 40 inches and have B horizons.  Tryon soils have a solum thickness of 3 to 9 inches, have buried A horizons, have an 0 horizons and are only calcareous in the O horizons.  Tyre soils have a lithic contact at depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Wanser soils have a mean annual soil temperature that ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F."
