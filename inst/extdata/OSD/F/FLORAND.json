Fishsnooze and Sonorapass soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Forsell and Sumeadow soils are very deep.  Lostridge soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Sibelia soils have depth to base of the cambic horizon of 14 to 24 inches and have horizons in the particle-size control section that are dominated by cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Florand soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on concave-shaped backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium over residuum derived from andesitic tuff and tuff-breccia.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
