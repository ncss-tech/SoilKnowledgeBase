  "OVERVIEW": "The Florand series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from andesitic tuff and tuff-breccia.  Florand soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
