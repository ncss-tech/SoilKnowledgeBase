    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from about 40 to 60 inches.\nThe Ap1 or A1 horizon is grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam, or silty clay loam.  The Ap2 or A2 horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) silt loam.  Thickness of the A horizon is 6 to 15 inches.  It ranges from medium acid through mildly alkaline.  Tongues of the A horizon, 1 to 6 inches wide, extends to a depth of 20 to 40 inches below the surface.\nThe Bt horizon is gray (10YR 5/1; 5Y 5/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), or dark gray (10YR 4/1) silt loam or silty clay loam.  Mottles are in shades of gray and brown.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and 3 to 10 percent sand that is dominantly very fine sand.  The Bt horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Most pedons have carbonate concretions within the middle or lower Bt horizon.\nThe B3 horizon is in shades of brown or gray with brownish or grayish mottles.  It is silt loam, and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is in shades of brown or gray with brownish or grayish mottles.  It is silt loam and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

Amagon, Essen, Patoutville, and Routon soils lack tonguing of the A2 horizon into the Bt horizon.  Also, Essen, McCune, and Patoutville soils are better drained and have higher chroma colors in the control section.  Basile and Guyton soils have more than 10 percent sand.  Bonn, Deerford, Foley, and Verdun soils have natric horizons.  Caddo soils are acid and have more than 10 percent sand in the control section.  Calhoun, Frost, Guyton, and Routon soils are more acid."
