    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to more than 100 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the A and E horizons except where the surface has been limed. The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in upper part of the Bt horizon and from very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe A or AP horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe E, EB or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow brown red and below a depth of 18 inches, gray range from none to many. Texture is loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 to 6; or it is commonly multicolored in shades of yellow, brown, gray and red. Some pedons have a few calcium carbonate concretions. Texture is dominantly clay loam, but some pedons are silty clay or clay.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, or red range from common to many. Some pedons have a few calcium carbonate concretions.

They formed in loamy and clayey marine or fluvial sediments. The climate is humid subtropical. The mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 52 inches near the type location."

These soils have been included in the Freestone series.\nFreest soils are in MLRAs 133A and 135A.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http;://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nLaboratory data was provided by Auburn University, Soil Characterization laboratory, Auburn AL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
