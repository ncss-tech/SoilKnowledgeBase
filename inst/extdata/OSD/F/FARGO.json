  "OVERVIEW": "The Fargo series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, clayey lacustrine sediments. These soils are on glacial lake plains, floodplains, and gently sloping side slopes of streams within glacial lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 575 millimeters.",
