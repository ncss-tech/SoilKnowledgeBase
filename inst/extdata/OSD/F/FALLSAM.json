  "REVDATE": "12/2006",
  "STATES": "AZ,NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fallsam series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in fine textured materials mixed with basalt fragments on basalt flows around the base of volcanic cones or vents. Slopes are 1 to 40 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual temperature is 46 degrees F.",

The landscape includes a series of stony ridges of \"squeeze ups\" with flat areas between them. Fallsam soils occur around the base of the stony ridges. The soils formed in fine textured materials mixed with basalt fragments ranging in size from gravel to boulders. Annual temperature at the type location is 46 degrees F., the annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches, and the Thornthwaite P-E Index is 26."

The rock fragments make it difficult to evaluate shrink-swell in the field and laboratory data are not available. The mineralogy is assumed to be montmorillonitic based on the mineralogy of similar soils."
