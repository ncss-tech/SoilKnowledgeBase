  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness to shale or shaly clay\nis 10 to 20 inches.  The soil is grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y\n5/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4; 2.5Y 6/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4), or pale olive (5Y 6/3, 6/4).\nThe A horizon is gravelly clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly silty clay loam, gravelly clay, gravelly silty clay or\ntheir very gravelly counterparts.  It contains 20 to 70 percent by volume of angular fragments of limestone, siltstone, ironstone, fossil shells, and iron nodules that are mainly 1/4 to 3 inches in diameter.  The surface is covered with 30 to 80 percent scattered limestone, siltstone, and ironstone pebbles, cobbles, stones, and boulders, fossil shells, and iron nodules.\nThe B horizon is clay loam, silty clay, or clay with clay content\nof 40 to 60 percent.  Carbonate clay comprises 2 to about 10\npercent.  Coarse fragments comprise 0 to about 10 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is clayey shale, shaly clay, or shaly silty clay.  Some pedons contain interbedded layers of limy marl and thin calcareous weakly cemented shaly flagstones.  Some of these\nfragments do not slake in water.  Colors are mainly shades of\nolive and yellow but some pedons contain red and gray colors.  Salinity ranges from about 1 to 4 mmhos/cm in the saturation\nextract."

Glenrio soils have sola with hues of 2.5YR and 5YR and have mean annual soil temperature of less than about 65 degrees  F.\nMaverick soils are underlain with shales at 20 to 40 inches and\nhave average annual soil temperatures of more than 72 degrees F.  Owens soils are moist in the moisture control section for longer periods."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Felipe soils are on the steep sides and lower footslopes of hills.  Slopes are mainly 8 to 40 percent but range from 1 to 45 percent.  The soils formed from shaly sediments like those of the Grayson formation of Cretaceous age.  The climate is semiarid.  Average annual rainfall ranges from 12 to 20 inches, Thornthwaite P-E indices from 16 to 32, and mean annual soil temperatures from 65 degrees to 70 degrees F."

Ector soils are underlain with limestone bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches.  Reagan soils are deep silty clay loam."
