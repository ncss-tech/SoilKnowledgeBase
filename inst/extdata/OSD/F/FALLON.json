    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fallon soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces. They formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,158 to 1,463 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 150 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) from April through September.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent. Some areas may have  high water tables within 50 cm of the soil surface in depositional areas as a result of extensive irrigation and a lack of subsurface drainage.  Some phases are susceptible to rare flooding for brief periods year-round or frequent flooding for long periods between March and November."

The principal crops are alfalfa hay, alfalfa-grass pasture, small grains, corn for silage, and some fruits and vegetables.  The vegetation in rangeland is mainly rubber rabbitbrush, black greasewood, and inland saltgrass."
