  "OVERVIEW": "The Fallon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Fallon soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 150 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) from April through September.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent. Some areas may have  high water tables within 50 cm of the soil surface in depositional areas as a result of extensive irrigation and a lack of subsurface drainage.  Some phases are susceptible to rare flooding for brief periods year-round or frequent flooding for long periods between March and November."
