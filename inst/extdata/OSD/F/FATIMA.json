It commonly is silt loam but may be loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and commonly chroma of 2. Chroma of 3 is allowed if Fe depletions are present with value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2 and commonly is stratified. It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam with less than 30 percent clay. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gilliam, Radford and Tice series.  Similar soils are the Amana, Dockery, and Nodaway series.  Gilliam soils have free calcium carbonate at depths less than 20 inches.  Radford soils have buried A horizons within a depth of 40 inches.  Tice soils are somewhat poorly drained and have redoximorphic features in the second one-fourth of the control section.  Amana soils have stratification in some part.  Dockery and Nodaway soils do not have mollic epipedons and are more stratified."
