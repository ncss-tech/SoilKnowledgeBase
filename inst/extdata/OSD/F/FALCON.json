  "STATES": "CO,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Falcon series consists of shallow, well to somewhat excessively drained soils that are formed in materials weathered residually from arkose and similar beds overlying hard sandstone, interbedded sandstone and shale, or conglomerate.  They are on upland ridges, hills, mountain sideslopes, mesa tops, and benches.   Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

A large proportion of the sand fraction is medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand which has a high percentage of flat bearing surfaces between sand grains.\nRock fragment content--0 to 35 percent, mainly less than 75 mm in diameter but range from 3 to 250 mm in diameter.\nA horizon:\nHue--2.5Y to 7.5YR\nValue--3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist\nChroma--1 to 4 dry or moist\nBase saturation--typically is more than 80 percent but ranges from 60 to 100 percent\nReaction--pH 5.6 to 7.6\nC horizon (when present):\nHue--2.5Y to 7.5YR\nValue--4 to 7 dry, and 4 or 5 moist\nChroma--2 to 4 dry or moist\nTexture--fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nBase saturation--typically is more than 80 percent but ranges from 60 to 100 percent\nReaction-- pH 5.6 to 7.6"
