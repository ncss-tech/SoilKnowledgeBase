    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Akhoni (NM), Ansari (CO), Corpening (WY), and Falconry (CO) series.  Akhoni soils do not have particle-size control sections dominated by coarse sand and have B horizons.  Ansari and Corpening soils are calcareous and have continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation. Falconry soils have less than 35 percent fine sand and coarser."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Falcon soils are on upland ridges, hills, sideslopes or mountain hillslopes, and benches generally at the crests and shoulders of the highest parts of the landscape.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 65 percent.  At the type location, the soils formed in materials weathered residually from arkose sedimentary beds overlying strata of hard sandstone and conglomerate.  In other areas, the soils formed in interbedded sandstone and shale and siltstone.  The mean annual precipitation in Colorado ranges from 16 to 19 inches.  In Utah, and other areas in Colorado, precipitation ranges from 16 to 25 inches per year in elevations ranging from 7,400 to 9,500 feet with annual temperatures of 37 to 44 degrees F."
