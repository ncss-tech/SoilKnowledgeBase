Lithology of fragments are mixed.\nAp horizon\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y.\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nC horizons\nHue: 10YR or 2.5Y.\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 1 through 3, dry or moist; chroma 1 occurs mainly below a depth of 76 cm and represents the color of uncoated sand grains.\nTexture: Dominantly sand, but includes stratified fine sand to coarse sand; Some pedons have subhorizons of loamy sand; Some pedons have fine or moderately fine textured strata below a depth of 122 cm.\nRedoximorphic features: Redox concentrations occur as few to many, medium to very coarse, faint to distinct masses of iron accumulation; Some pedons have few to common dark manganese concretions below a depth of 90 cm.\nOther features: Some pedons in uncultivated areas that are saline-sodic are effervescent in surface horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fernley soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces.  They typically occur in \"stringers\" of modified (land-leveled), bar and channel microrelief.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1158 to 1463 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 60 and 150 cm (moderately deep and deep free water occurrence classes) from April through September.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for brief or very brief periods year-round."

The main irrigated crops are alfalfa, pasture, and small grains.  The vegetation in rangeland is dominantly rabbitbrush, black greasewood, and inland saltgrass."
