  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Fairystone soils were previously mapped as inclusions in Littlejoe, Buffstat, and Bugley soils. These soils have relatively thin argillic horizons, many less than 10 inches thick. They are tentatively classified as Typic Hapludults; however, the type location is borderline to Inceptic Hapludults. Additional investigation is needed to accurately determine the predominance of the argillic horizon thickness and a new type location may be needed. Levels of total carbon are high due to the influence of graphitic parent materials; however organic matter from plant residue is thought to be similar to adjacent soils. Where Cr layers are present, fracture intervals are too close to qualify for paralithic contact.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 5 inches (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from about 7 to 17 inches (Mid and lower BAt horizon and Bt horizon)\nLithic contact--hard bedrock contact at 31 inches (R horizon)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 31 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE (Lab Pedon Number: 99P0441; User Pedon ID: 99VA141004). Additional data: (Lab Pedon Number: 99P0440; User Pedon ID: 99VA141003)\nData Map Unit ID: 533842\nPedon Record ID: 263696\nUser Pedon ID: VA141_Fairystone_OSD_cnl\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
