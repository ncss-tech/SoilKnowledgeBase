Gilroy soils, on uplands, have color hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and commonly have medium acid reaction. Gonzaga and Honker soils, on mountains, have a fine particle-size control section and an abrupt clay increase from the A to the B horizon. Millsholm and Quinto soils, on mountains, have a lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches and do not have a mollic epipedon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Franciscan soils were formerly included with and mapped as the Vallecitos series in the Los Banos Area, California, 1939 Series Report.  They are being differentiated by having a horizontally continuous fine-loamy argillic horizon and a mollic epipedon.\nBallard, Bohna, Chualar, Chuloak, Gilroy, Pinto, Soper and Tehachapi series were not considered competing series for this update. All of these series need Cation-Exchange Activity Class determined. They are currently classified as fine-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Argixerolls. Most of these series will probably be placed in the Active Cation-Exchange Activity Class which will separate them taxonomically from Franciscan series. Ballard, Bohna, Chualar, Chuloak, Pinto and Tehachapi are very deep.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic Epipedon- the zone from 0 to 10 inches (A1, A2 horizons)\nLithic Contact- the boundary from 38 to 42 inches (R horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
