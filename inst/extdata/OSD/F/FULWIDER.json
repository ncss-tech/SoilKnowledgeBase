  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fulwider series consists of soils that are well drained and shallow to a duripan. These soils have formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from limestone with a component of loess on piedmont slopes and dissected fan terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
