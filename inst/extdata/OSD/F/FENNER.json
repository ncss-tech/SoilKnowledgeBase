  "OVERVIEW": "The Fenner series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly alluvium from volcanic and metamorphic sources. The Fenner soils are on fan aprons. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 20 degrees C.",
