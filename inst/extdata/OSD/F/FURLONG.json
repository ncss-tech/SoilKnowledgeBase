The depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Rock fragments are mainly limestone, but include some igneous and metamorphic fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 3. It is sand or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 5 to 7; and chroma of 1 or 3.  It is sand or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand or loamy sand. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand or loamy sand.
