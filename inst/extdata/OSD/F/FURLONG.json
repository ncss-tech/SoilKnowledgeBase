  "OVERVIEW": "The Furlong series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sandy deposits underlain by limestone on ground moraines and outwash plains.  Permeability is rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Rock fragments are mainly limestone, but include some igneous and metamorphic fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 3. It is sand or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 5 to 7; and chroma of 1 or 3.  It is sand or loamy sand. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sand or loamy sand. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand or loamy sand.
