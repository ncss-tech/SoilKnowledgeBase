  "OVERVIEW": "The Filbert series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in loess. They are in open depressions (see remarks) on stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, at the type location.",
