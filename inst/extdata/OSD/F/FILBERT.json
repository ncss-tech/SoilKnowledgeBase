(E horizons)\nargillic horizon:  The zone from 15 to 80 inches.  (All Bt horizons)\nlinear extensibility: exceeds 6.0 between the surface and 100 cm\nRemarks: These soils were mapped as Butler or Fillmore, drained on older surveys. These soils possibly formed in enclosed depressions, but road construction and ditches and past drainage activities have provided surface drainage of the area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth edition, 1998\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
