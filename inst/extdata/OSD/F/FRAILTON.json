  "OVERVIEW": "The Frailton series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from tuff.  Frailton soils are on foothills and mountainsides and have slopes of 15 to 60 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
