  "OVERVIEW": "The Freeboard series consists of deep moderately well drained soils that formed in andesite and volcanic rock residuum. Freeboard soils are on side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains on islands. The mean annual precipitation is about 355 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 21 degrees C (69 degrees F). Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.",
