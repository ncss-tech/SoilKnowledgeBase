  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fortyfour soils occur on spur ridges and convex, upper slopes of mountains. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. Elevations are 90 to 780 meters (295 to 2555 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1780 to 2550 millimeters (70 to 100 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. Frost-free season is 240 to 280 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 31 centimeters (Oi & A horizons).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 31 to 99 centimeters (BAt, Bt1, & Bt2 horizons)\n3. Paralithic contact - the bedrock interface at 99 centimeters.\n4. Ultisol feature - base saturation is 11.6 percent at the paralithic contact.\n5. Udult feature - organic carbon is 0.50 percent in the BAt. Cumulative organic carbon is 10.8 Kg per square meter to the paralithic contact.\n6. Hapludult feature - the maximum clay percentage is 41 and the clay percent drops to 0 in the CR horizon.\n6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 31 to 81 centimeters, averages 43 percent clay, by weight, and 17 percent rock fragments, by volume. CEC / clay ratio averages 0.37, and iron oxide 8 percent. Since associated soils have about two thirds as much gibbsite as iron oxide, more than 2 percent gibbsite is assumed.\nADDITIONAL DATA: The Fortyfour typical pedon was sampled under field numbers S82-CA-12-05X and 84-RNP-12 for analysis at the University of California soil morphology laboratory, and the Oregon State University soil testing and soil physics laboratories. Sample numbers 84-RNP-1 and 84-RNP-2 were collected from other Fortyfour pedons.\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.  The OSD Fourtyfour has been made inactive, Fortyfour replaces it.\nNASIS User Pedon # S10CA023017\nKSSL Lab number  10N0688\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
