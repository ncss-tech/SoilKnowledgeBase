  "OVERVIEW": "The Ferney series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial till on uplands. Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.",
