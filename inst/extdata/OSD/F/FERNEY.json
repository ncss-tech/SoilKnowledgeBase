    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates and depth to horizons with accumulations of salt range from 5 to 16 inches.  Ferney soils contain up to 5 percent pebbles. The soils have a Udic soil moisture regime.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or less.  It is clay loam, loam or silt loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have an E horizon 1 to 5 inches thick with a hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam or clay averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btnkz horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or clay.  It typically has common or many accumulations of salts and few to many accumulations of carbonate.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adger, Exline, Miranda and Rhoades series in the same family. Adger soils do not have mottles, typically have less fine sand or coarser sand and formed in clayey alluvium or residuum from shale. Exline and Rhoades soils have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser sand. In addition, Exline soils formed in lacustrine materials and the Rhoades soils formed in clayey material weathered from shale. Miranda soils have an Ustic moisture regime."

The Ferney soils formed in firm clay loam glacial till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches."

The Aastad, Forman, and Peever soils do not have a natric horizon and are on nearby uplands. Cavour soils have thicker combined A and E horizons and have accumulations of salts at depths greater than 16 inches. The Cavour soils are in slightly higher positions on the landscape. The Cresbard soils have interfingering or tonguing of E materials for more than 1 inch into the Bt horizon and are on slightly higher landscape positions.  The poorly drained Heil and Tonka soils are in depressions.  In addition, the Tonka soils do not have a natric horizon.  The Ranslo soils are on stream terraces and bottomlands and formed in clayey alluvium."
