  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 81 centimeters (0 to 32 inches) (A, E, Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nAlbic horizon: The zone from 23 to 33 centimeters (9 to 13 inches) (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon:--The zone from 33 to 81 centimeters (13 to 32 inches) (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).\nVertic features: The presence of linear Extensibility of 6.0 cm or more between 0 and 100 cm (0 to 40 inches). This was determined from lab data for Fillmore and similar soils.\nTerrace phases are recognized that have sand or coarse textured material below the loess cap at a depth of 3 to 10 meters (10 to 30 ft.).\nA poorly drained, ponded phase is also recognized that has interpretations similar to the Scott series.\nOSD Modification 6/2002RRZ\nDark shot as described the E horizons of Fillmore soil is questionable as a natural occurring event.  This observation is probably due to tillage or drainage operations, which have destroyed or mixed some of the E horizon with Bt material containing the (shot-like) material. Possibly some freeze/thaw activities could move the concretions into the contact zone of the lower Bt horizon.  The silty clay loam surface layer is due to farming or landscaping activities.  Under natural conditions the surface layer is silt loam. Added redox information; added Sturges to competing series.\n10/17/05 JCR\nChanged format to semi-tab. Changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity\n12/2011 DJK\nChanged mean annual precipitation from 23 inches to 27 inches.\nAdded in elevation for typical pedon.\nAdded quadrangle and latitude/longitude to type location.\nAdded mollic thickness and depth to argillic in RIC. Added in clay content and sand content for each horizon in RIC. For E horizon added value of 6 to moist color. For Bt horizon deleted 5Y an N from hue, added silty clay loam, deleted clay, and changed clay percent. BC horizon added silty clay.\nUnder geomorphic setting, added in closed depressions for landform and deleted stream terraces, entered in elevation range and frost-free days, and updated precipitation and temperature.\nUnder geographically associated soils, deleted Belfore, Holder, Holdrege, and Tomek and updated other soils.\nUnder Drainage and Kst, deleted runoff, changed flooding to ponding, added in ponding and saturation statement, and changed Ksat from very low to low. Added soybeans in for crops.\nAdded LRRs and MLRAs to distribution and extent, and change to large extent.\nAdded in additional data showing NSSL characterization pedons and typical pedon.\n8/2012 DJK Added mean annual soil temperature and horizons where have redox to RIC. Lowered the sand content in PSCS and the Bt horizon from 3 to 2 percent. Removed moderately acid from reaction for the Bt horizon. Removed moderately alkaline from reaction for the BC horizon.  Added CCE to the BC and C horizons in RIC and added statement on now being Bk horizons . Added precipitation pattern to geographic setting. Updated competing series. Removed Hastings from geographically associated soils. Removed statement about changing classification to match Filbert, Massie, and Scott from remarks.\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory data is available for Pedon IDs 79NE059008, 86NE035001, 90NE155033, 90NE155033A, 90NE155033B, and 09NE035001. Pedon ID 1963NE035001 represents the Typical Pedon and is in NASIS.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
