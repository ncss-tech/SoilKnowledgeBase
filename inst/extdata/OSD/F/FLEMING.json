  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 28 to 50 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 inches or more.  Coarse fragments of limestone, shale or siltstone range from 0 to 25 percent by volume.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid in the solum, and is slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with a weighted average of more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.\nThe BC horizon is neutral or has hue of 5G, 5GY, 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is silty clay or clay.\nThe CB or C horizon, when present, has hue of 5Y, 5GY, or 5G, value of 5 or 6 and chromas of 3 or less, and typically is variegated or has mottles in shades of red, brown and yellow.  It is silty clay, or clay.  It is high in magnesium and is believed to have contained originally, much more sodium.\nThe Cr horizon is greenish gray soft clayey shale.  Some pedons have red and olive yellow mottles."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Basco, Belpre, Brooke, Caleast, McAfee, and Salvisa series in the same family.  Basco soils have a thin loess mantle and are interstratified with sandstone and shale within a depth of 40 inches.  Belpre soils are slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the solum and have free carbonates within a depth of 30 inches.  Brooke and Salvisa soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Caleast soils have limestone bedrock with thin strata of calcareous shales and have siltstones at depths of 40 to 80 inches or more.  McAfee soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Sloping to steep upland ridgetops and upper sideslopes with slopes of about 6 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in red clayey residuum from limestone about 20 to 40 inches thick underlain by unconforming greenish gray clayey residuum from calcareous clay shales.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 52 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hagerstown, Shrouts, Beasley, Otway and Brassfield series.  Hagerstown has a thicker solum, and lacks the greenish gray calcareous substratum.  Shrouts has a thinner solum and gray B horizon.  Beasley lacks a dark A horizon, commonly is less red in the B horizon, and has C horizon generally containing more sand and less clay.  Otway and Brassfield have cambic horizons."
