  "OVERVIEW": "The Freewater series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in gravelly alluvium mixed with loess in the upper part.  Freewater soils are on high stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 15 to 20 inches thick.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 70 to 80 consecutive days within the 12 to 35 inches moisture control section during the summer and autumn.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 55 degrees F.  The particle-size control section has 45 to 75 percent rock fragments.  Organic matter content decreases to 1 percent within a depth of 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly sand or loamy sand and averages 65 to 85 percent rock fragments.  Horizons with extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly sandy loam texture, 5 inches or less thick, are in the 2C horizon in some pedons.\nIn some pedons there is an AC horizon of extremely gravelly sandy loam."
