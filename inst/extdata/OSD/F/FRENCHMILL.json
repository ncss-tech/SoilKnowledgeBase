  "OVERVIEW": "The Frenchmill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvial materials weathered from acid igneous rocks.  These soils are on mid and lower back slopes and foot slopes of mountain ridges. Slopes range from 8 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

Hassler soils are moderately deep and are on less sloping ridgetops, sideslopes and benches. Irondale and Knobtop soils are moderately deep to bedrock and are on side slopes and ridgetops above Frenchmill soils.  Killarney soils have a fragipan and are on similar landscape positions.  Skranka soils are in the fine textural family, and are in basins.  Taumsauk soils are less than 20 inches to bedrock and are on sideslopes above Frenchmill soils.  Tilk soils have a higher base saturation, and are on flood plains.  Trackler soils are deep to bedrock, have less than 35 percent rock fragments and are on ridgetops and shoulder slopes above the Frenchmill soils."
