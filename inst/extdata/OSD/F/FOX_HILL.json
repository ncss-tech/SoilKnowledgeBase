    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:\nAcquango soils--do not have a seasonal high water table above 72 inches (183 centimeters); on higher dune positions\nAskecksy soils--have quartz rock fragments, lack sulfidic materials in their substratum, and often are vegetated with mature hardwood or pine species.  Askecksy soils do not occur on back barrier island landforms.  They also lack soil pore water salinity.\nBrockatonorton soils--do not have a seasonal high water table above 20 inches (50 centimeters); on higher dune landform positions.  Brockatonorton soils may likely have \"sodic\" taxonomic subgroup properties like Fox Hill but currently are not recognized.\nDemas soils--formed on subaqueous washover-fan flat landforms directly adjacent to the barrier islands, these receive fresh sand deposits annually.\nHooksan soils--do not have a seasonal high water table above 72 inches (183 centimeters); on higher dune positions.\nMantoloking soils--formed on subaqueous relict flood-tidal delta landforms in close proximity to the barrier island.\nPawcatuck soils--formed in organic material 16 to 51 inches (40 to 130 centimeters) thick; on lower marsh positions that are tidally flooded twice daily.\nPurnell soils--formed in organic material 8 to 16 inches (20 to 40 centimeters); on lower marsh positions that are tidally flooded twice daily.\nSaltpond soils--formed on slightly lower landforms and have sulfidic materials within 20 inches (50 centimeters) of the soil surface; tidally flooded twice daily."

A few areas are cleared and used for recreational purposes such as camp sites.\nDominant Vegetation:  Vegetation consists primarily of low shrub type including: northern bayberry, Virginia creeper, white and red cedar, wax myrtle, green briar, poison ivy, and phragmites.  These areas have a wide diversity of vegetation and ecology."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Fox Hill soils were previously mapped as Askecksy soils on the barrier islands in Maryland and Atsion tide flooded soils in New Jersey.\nThe Sodium Absorption Ratio (SAR) may exceed 13 in most mineral horizons.  The sodium source is the salt water that frequently floods these soils on extreme tides and weather events. The adjacent estuary can also be a source of sodium as salt water persists in the lower portions of these soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nAquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 78 inches (195 centimeters).\nLithologic Discontinuity--the zone from 33 to 78 inches (149 to 195 cm) (2Aseb horizon)\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 5 cm (2 inches) (O and A horizons)\nSodic properties (SAR more than 13)--1 to 26 inches and 59 to 77 inches (2 to 66 centimeters and 149 to 195 centimeters) (the A, Cg1, Cg2, and 2Aseb horizons)\nSulfidic materials--the zone from 26 to 78 inches (66 to 195 centimeters) (the Cseg and 2Aseg horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Rossi, A.M. 2014 PhD. dissertation, Pedogenesis and Hydromorphology of Soils in Mid-Atlantic Barrier Island Landscapes, University of Maryland\nDatabase Information:\nMLRA Data Mapunit ID: 800953, 807425\nMLRA Mapunit ID: 2xhpr, 2xh43\nOSD User Pedon ID: S2013MD047002\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
