  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and content of fine sand or coarser averages 15 to 70 percent. The base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 60 percent in some part of the argillic horizon. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle and from 5 to 35 percent in the till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the till. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 3 percent in the till. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum, except that it ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the substratum. Redox concentrations are within 40 inches and occur as high in the profile as the E horizon in some pedons. Redox depletions are below the upper 10 inches of the argillic in some pedons. Saturation occurs below the upper 10 inches of the argillic, but within a depth of 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Uncultivated areas have A horizons,1 to 4 inches thick, with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and a chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4. It is silt loam. Bw horizons with spodic color have less than 0.6 percent organic carbon.\nFreeon soils have a glossic horizon. Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the degree to which eluviation has occurred. Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizon has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizons has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The 2E part is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs, but in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand. The 2Bt part has color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described below.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 4 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.90. Some pedons have pockets or strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 4 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Clay content averages more than 7 percent. Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc. Some pedons have pockets or strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 4 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Clay content averages more than 7 percent. Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc. Some pedons have pockets or strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand."

Santiago soils are on steeper sloping landforms. Magnor soils are in lower or less sloping areas. Cebana, Adolph, and Capitola soils are in depressions and drainageways.\nThe moderately well drained Spencer soils are on similar landscape positions as Freeon soils, the somewhat poorly drained Almena soils are in lower or less sloping areas, and the poorly drained Auburndale soils are in depressions and drainageways. These soils have a silty mantle greater than 36 inches thick.\nThe well drained Amery and Newot soils, and the moderately well drained Haugen and Newood soils are on landscape positions that are similar to, higher than, or more sloping than those of Freeon soils where the silty mantle is less than 12 inches thick, or is absent."
