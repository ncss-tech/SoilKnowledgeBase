  "OVERVIEW": "The Foxmount series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff and associated volcanic flow rock. Foxmount soils are on mountain crests and side slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
