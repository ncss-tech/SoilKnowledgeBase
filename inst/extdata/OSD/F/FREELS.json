  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches and the organic matter content of the mixed upper 10 inches is estimated to be more than 3 percent and decreases irregularly with depth. The depth to a fluctuating water table is 36 to 60 inches during the spring. The soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout. The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick. The particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe A horizons and AB horizons, when present, have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. The texture of the lower part of the A and the AB horizon is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. The texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel. In some pedons there is a layer of volcanic ash in the upper part of the Bw horizon. Redox concentrations are present in the lower part of the Bw horizon in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is silt loam, sandy loam, or sand. It has 0 to 60 percent gravel."
