  "OVERVIEW": "The Fruithurst series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from serecite schist, phyllite or other fine-grained metamorphic rock. These soils are on sloping to steep uplands of the Piedmont Plateau. Water runs off the surface medium to rapidly depending on slope and vegetation cover. Slopes range from 6 to 35 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact (Cr) range from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches. Content of gravel-size quartz or schist fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A, E and BE horizons, and from 0 to 15 percent in the Bt horizon. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid except where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6. It is clay loam, loam, or silt loam with more than 30 percent silt in the control section. In most pedons clay content increases with depth and the Bt horizon becomes redder with depth.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored, highly weathered loamy serecite schist, phyllite or other fine-grained metamorphic rock saprolite with relict rock structure."

Rion soils have bedrock at a depth of more than 60 inches. Rome, Shady, State, and Wickham soils formed in alluvium on stream terraces and have thicker sola. Sherless soils have Cr horizons of Mississippian shale and sandstone. Sherwood soils have hard Pennsylvanian sandstone bedrock at a depth of 30 to 60 inches. Sugargrove and Tidings soils have Cr horizons of sandstone and shale at depths of 40 to 60 inches."
