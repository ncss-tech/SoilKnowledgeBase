  "OVERVIEW": "The Foxpoint series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from sandstone.  Foxpoint soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 50 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

(A horizon)\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nThe surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, \"Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979.\"\nThe classification was changed from Typic Haploborolls to frigid, Typic Haplustolls 11/98.\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998."
