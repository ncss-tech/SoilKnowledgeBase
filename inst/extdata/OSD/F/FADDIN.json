  "OVERVIEW": "The Faddin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits derived from the Beaumont Formation of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on ancient meander ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22.8 degrees C (73 degrees F).",

These soils were formerly mapped in the Bernard or Telferner series.  Data from NSSL, Sample Nos., 79PO183-187. The series was reclassified in December 2008 during the correlation of Goliad County from Aquic Argiudolls to Oxyaquic Argiudolls. The classification was changed in 2019 to Vertic Argiudolss due to analysis of soil moisture studies done on similar textured soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 61 cm (24 in) (A, Bt1 horizons)\nArgillic horizons: 41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btk)\nSecondary Carbonates: 117 to 203 cm (46 to 80 in) (Btk)"
