    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification is changed from Abruptic Argiaquolls to Aquic Argiudolls based on the \"Soil Moisture Study Conducted in Texas and Louisiana (ICOMAQ) 1990.\"  This soil does not have an aquic moisture regime.  These soils were formerly mapped in the Bernard or Telferner series.  Data from NSSL, Sample Nos., 79PO183-187. The series was reclassified in December 2008 during the correlation of Goliad County from Aquic Argiudolls to Oxyaquic Argiudolls. The classification was changed in 2019 to Vertic Argiudolss due to analysis of soil moisture studies done on similar textured soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 61 cm (24 in) (A, Bt1 horizons)\nArgillic horizons: 41 to 203 cm (16 to 80 in) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btk)\nSecondary Carbonates: 117 to 203 cm (46 to 80 in) (Btk)\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL data on pedon 79P0036.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
