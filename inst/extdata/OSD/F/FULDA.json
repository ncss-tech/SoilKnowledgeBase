    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates ranges from 51 to 107 centimeters (20 to 42 inches). These soils do not have rock fragments. The mollic epipedon ranges from 30 to 61 centimeters (12 to 24 inches) in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or less. It has redox features in some pedons. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It is neutral. In some pedons, few through many tongues of the A horizon extend into the B horizon, but typically the boundary between the A and B horizons is smooth. An AB horizon is in some pedons.\nThe Bg and Bkg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. They commonly have distinct or prominent redox features. They are silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or slightly concave slopes with gradient of 0 to 2 percent on glacial\nmoraines and lake plains. They formed in calcareous clayey glacial lacustrine or local alluvial sediments. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C (40 to 44 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 51 to 69 centimeters (20 to 27 inches). Frost-free days range from 120 to 172. Elevation above sea level ranges from 302 to 594 meters (990 to 1950 feet)."

In places Fulda soils are associated with Audubon, Boyerlake, Foxlake, and Hattie soils. All these soils formed in glacial till and are higher lying."
