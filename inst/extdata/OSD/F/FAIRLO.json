    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 14 to 24 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 19 inches.  Depth to clayey sediments is typically from 26 to 35 inches but ranges from 24 to 38 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, chroma of 2 to 4.  It is typically silty clay loam but is silt loam in some pedons.  The estimated clay percentages range from 26 to 35 percent.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of  5 to 7 and 4 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has 2.5Y or 10YR hue, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent, but typically contains more than 40 percent clay.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon of similar color and textures as the Bk horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Agar, Eakin, Highmore, Holdredge, Monticello, Northdale, and Paka soils of the same family.  Agar, Eakin, Highmore, and Holdredge soils do not have fine textures at depths of 24 to 38 inches.  In addition, Eakin soils are underlain by glacial till and Holdredge soils formed in deep loess. Monticello and Northdale soils contain more very fine sand and have redder hues.  In addition, Northdale soils have bedrock within depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Paka soils have soft siltstone at depths of 40 to 60 inches."

Agar, Dorna, and McClure soils are on similar landscapes. Dorna soils do not have an argillic horizon.  McClure soils have a fine textured argillic horizon. Carter soils have more clay in the series control section and are in the lower parts of the landscape.  Hurley soils have a natric horizon and are in slightly depressed areas (microrelief).  Millboro soils are on nearly similar landscapes and they have fine-textured argillic horizons.  Mobridge and Onita soils are in swales and have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick.  In addition, Onita soils have fine-textured argillic horizons."
