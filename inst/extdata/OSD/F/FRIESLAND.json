Atkinson and Hitt soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Burchard soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches) and have less than 50 percent silt throughout the argillic horizon.   Cokato, Cresent, Griswold, Jasper, Keosauqua, Kishwaukee, Morrill, Parmod, and Schoocraft soils have less than 50 percent silt throughout the argillic horizon and do not have redox features and saturation in the lower part of the series control section. The Cresco series is being reclassified as Oxyaquic Argiudolls. Durand soils have hue of 5YR in some part of the argillic and do not have redox features and saturation in the series control section. Joslin soils have more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section and do not have redox features or saturation there. Marbletown soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (4o to 60 inches). Moingona, Reedslake, and Winnebago soils have less than 50 percent silt throughout the series control section. Nuxmaruhanixete, Pana, and Ringwood soils do not have redox features or saturation in the series control section. Penfield soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Friesland soils are on ground moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  These soils formed in a mantle of loamy outwash or eolian deposits and in the underlying silty deposits.  The origin of the silty deposit is thought to be eolian (loess).  Glacial till is at a depth greater than 102 cm (40 inches).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 635 to 864 mm (25 to 34 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 7.8 to 11.1 degrees C (46 to 52 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Griswold and Ringwood soils and Grellton and Plano soils.  Griswold and Ringwood soils occupy slightly higher positions on the landscape and formed in glacial till with a thin surface layer of loess.  Grellton and Plano soils occupy similar positions on the landscape.  Grellton soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Plano soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of loess or other silty deposits and in underlying loamy stratified outwash or sandy loam till."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate. These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches)  for some time in most years."
