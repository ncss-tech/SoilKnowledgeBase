    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Freshwater soils are undulating to hilly on summits and sides of structural benches and plug domes at elevations of 1,590 to 1,830 meters.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from extrusive rocks.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 280 to 33 mm.  Average annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 47.2 degrees C.  Frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."

The remainder of the OSD has not been updated since 5/93.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - The zone 0 to 13 cm (A horizon.)\nArgillic horizon and particle-size control section - The zone 13 to 46 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nDuripan - The zone from 46 to 56 cm (Bkqm horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 56 cm (2R boundary).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
