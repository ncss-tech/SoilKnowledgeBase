  "OVERVIEW": "The Freshwater series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in alluvium from extrusive rocks.  Freshwater soils are on structural benches and plug domes.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",

The remainder of this document has not been updated."
