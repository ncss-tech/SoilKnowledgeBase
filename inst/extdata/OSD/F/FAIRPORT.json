  "OVERVIEW": "The Fairport series consists of moderately deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in silty or loamy glacial till overlying limestone bedrock.  These soils have moderate and moderately slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The bedrock is limestone, dolomite, or dolomite limestone.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Undisturbed pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have E/B horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.  Some pedons have a BC horizon.  When present it has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.

All the above soils except Allens Park, Bayerton, Cunard, Longrie, Plome, St. Ignace, and Summerville do not have a lithic contact within depths of 40 inches.  Allens Park soils do not have red hue and are underlain by granitic bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bayerton soils have a B3ca horizon and are underlain by sandstone bedrock.  Cunard soils are coarse-loamy.  Plome soils have more acid sola and are underlain by sandstone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Longrie soils have coarser textured sola and spodic horizons.  St. Ignace and Summerville soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches."
