The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches and is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year with about half the precipitation falling between April and September.  May and June are the driest months.  PE Index is about 45 at the type location and ranges from 30 to 50 for the series.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F., and mean summer temperature ranges from 60 to 68 degrees F."
