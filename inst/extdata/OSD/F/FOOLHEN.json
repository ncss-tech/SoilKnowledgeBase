  "OVERVIEW": "The Foolhen series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, alluvial fans, outwash plains, drainageways and closed depressions. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
