  "OVERVIEW": "The Firo series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from igneous bedrock on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 12 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
