  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

They formed in material derived mostly from mixed fine grained acid igneous formations. Slopes are 12 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 23 inches mostly as winter snows and late summer rains. The mean annual temperature is about 37 to 45 degrees F. The Thornthwaite P - E Index is about 30 to 50.  In Montana, elevation is as low as 4400 feet and precipitation is as low as 15 inches."
