  "OVERVIEW": "The Flumecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material from quartzite  with a thick mantle of volcanic ash located on mountain slopes. Permeability is moderate and slopes range from 15 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 42 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
