  "OVERVIEW": "The Frondorf series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in a mantle of loess over residuum from acid sandstone, siltstone and shale.  Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent.  Near the type location the average annual temperature is 57.9 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 48.13 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to sandstone, siltstone, or shale bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly to strongly acid.  Coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the A, E, and Bt horizons and from 15 to 75 percent in the 2Bt and 2BC horizons.    Coarse fragments consist of channers of sandstone, siltstone, or shale.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam.\nThe 2BC horizon, where present, has the same colors as the 2Bt. Texture of the fine-fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nWhen present, the 2C horizon has the same colors and textures as the 2BC horizon."

Of these only the Culleoka, Kell, Loudonville,Oatlands, and Spriggs series have bedrock at a depth of less than 4O inches.  Culleoka soils lack the lithologic discontinuity in the series control section, otherwise they are close competitors.  Kell soils formed in glacial drift material. Loudonville soils have an upper solum formed in glacial till and have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the 2Bt horizon.  Oatlands soils formed in Triassic age sediments of the Piedmont.  Spriggs soils formed in mafic bedrock of the Piedmont."
