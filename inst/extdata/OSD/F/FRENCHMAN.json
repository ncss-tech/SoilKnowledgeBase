    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frenchman soils occur on stream terraces.  They are 6 to 60 meters above present river levels and do not flood.  Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  Elevations are 76 to 518 meters.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A moderate coastal fog influence limits the diurnal and annual ranges of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1000 to 2030 millimeters.  Mean January temperature is about 6 degrees C., mean July temperature is about 18 degrees C. and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 220 to 320 days."
