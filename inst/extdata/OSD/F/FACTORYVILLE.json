  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 40 inches. Texture is dominantly fine sand but may range to sand in some pedons. Pebble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent by volume throughout the soil. Some pedons have carbonates below 40 inches. Redoximorphic concentrations are present in most pedons below 25 inches. Silty or clayey lacustrine layers are present in some pedons below 40 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. The value dry is 6 or more. Uncultivated areas have a thin, 1 to 4 inch thick, A horizon. The A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky. They are fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand. Structure is weak subangular blocky or single grain, with weak granular in some pedons. It is commonly moderately acid to neutral, but some pedons are strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6. Structure is massive or single grain, with weak subangular blocky in some pedons. It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6. It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or loamy sand. Structure is massive or single grain. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Abscota, Denham, Platteriver (T), and Solo series. All of these soils are from outside Region R. Abscota, Denham, Platteriver (T), and Solo soils are moderately well drained. Also, Abscota soils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon content with depth, Denham soils have a solum depth greater than 40 inches, Platteriver soils have more than 50 percent medium and coarser sand, and Solo soils formed in alluvial deposited volcanic ash."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Factoryville soils are on deltas, kame terraces, beach ridges, and lake plains. They formed in sandy glacio-lacustrine sediments or glacial outwash, derived from anorthositic gneiss and limestone. Slope gradients range from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 26 to 36 inches. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days. The elevation ranges from 95 to 500 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained Colonie, Dunkirk, Hartland, Howard, and Windsor soils are generally associated with Factoryville soils on deltas, kame terraces, and lake plains. The well drained Pittsfield, Charlton, Chatfield, and Hollis soils are generally associated with Factoryville soils on adjacent upland till landscapes. The poorly drained Gougeville, somewhat poorly drained Stafford, and the moderately well drained Deerfield soils are loosely associated in a drainage sequence with Factoryville soils."
