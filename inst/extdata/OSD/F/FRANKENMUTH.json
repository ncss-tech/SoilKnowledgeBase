  "OVERVIEW": "The Frankenmuth series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",
