  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Fopiano soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts at depths from 4 inches to the paralithic contact for 60 to 80 consecutive days in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F. Depth to a paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches. Hue throughout the soil is 10YR or 7.5YR.  Unweathered rock fragments throughout the solum range from 0 to 20 percent. They are stones, cobbles and pebbles and commonly are basaltic.  Mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2. It is ashy silty clay loam or ashy clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent glass and acid oxalate extractable plus one-half the iron is 0.3 to 0.5 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It has weak to strong blocky or subangular blocky structure.  It has strong, coarse prismatic structure in some pedons. It is clay with 40 to 50 percent clay."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Fopiano soils are on benches and hills at elevations ranging from 3,400 to 5,000 feet. The soils formed in colluvium from tuff and old sediments with some influence from loess. The climate is semiarid and has a mean annual precipitation of 13 to 16 inches. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.; the mean summer temperature is about 62 degrees F.; and the mean January temperature is 28 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from 30 to 80 days."

Calabar soils are on fans and terraces, are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock and have silty clay loam natric horizons. Marsden soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Snell soils are clayey, skeletal and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock."
