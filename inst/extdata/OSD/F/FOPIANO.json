  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fopiano series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed mainly in colluvium from tuff and old sediments, with some influence from loess. These soils are on benches and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Fopiano soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts at depths from 4 inches to the paralithic contact for 60 to 80 consecutive days in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F. Depth to a paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches. Hue throughout the soil is 10YR or 7.5YR.  Unweathered rock fragments throughout the solum range from 0 to 20 percent. They are stones, cobbles and pebbles and commonly are basaltic.  Mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2. It is ashy silty clay loam or ashy clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent glass and acid oxalate extractable plus one-half the iron is 0.3 to 0.5 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It has weak to strong blocky or subangular blocky structure.  It has strong, coarse prismatic structure in some pedons. It is clay with 40 to 50 percent clay."
