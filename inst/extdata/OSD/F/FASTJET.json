  "OVERVIEW": "The Fastjet series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over residuum weathered from tuff and basalt. Fastjet soils are on lava plateaus and hillslopes. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
