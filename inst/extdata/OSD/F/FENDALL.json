  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. under canopy cover.  The soil is usually moist and is dry for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer. Depth to a paralithic contact and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Andic soil properties, when present, do not extend beyond 14 inches.  Rock fragments in the solum range from 0 to 25 percent. The particle-size control section has more than 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of through 3 moist and dry. The apparent field texture is commonly clay loam but ranges to silt loam or medial silt loam.  It has an estimated Alox + Feox of 2.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 1.0 g/cc.  Clay content is 20 to 30 percent.\nThe AB horizon, when present, has color similar to the A horizon. The apparent field texture is clay loam or silt loam.  It has an estimated Alox + Feox of 1.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.0 g/cc.  Clay content is 20 to 30 percent.\nThe Bw horizon, or Bw1 horizon when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam with 30 to 50 percent clay.\nThe Bw2 or BC horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It has variegated colors in some pedons.  Texture is clay or silty clay with 30 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 50 percent paragravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fendall soils are on ridges and side slopes on coastal hills, mountains, and dissected marine terraces at elevations of 50 to 800 feet. Slopes range from 3 to 85 percent. The soils formed in fine textured colluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary rock. Winters are cool and wet and summers are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 110 inches with a high proportion of low cloud and foggy days. The mean January temperature is 44 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 58 degrees F. The  mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 145 to 225 days."

All of these soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock and occur on coastal hills. Templeton soils average less than 35 percent clay in the texture control section.  Tolovana soils are medial over loamy.  Winema soils are medial over clayey."

If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
