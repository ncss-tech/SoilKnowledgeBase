  "OVERVIEW": "The Fertaline series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from andesite, basalt, tuff, and volcanic ash. Fertaline soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
