  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fertaline soils are on fan remnants. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rock such as andesite, basalt, tuff, and volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,985 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
