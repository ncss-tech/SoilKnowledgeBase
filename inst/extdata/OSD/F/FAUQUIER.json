  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent by volume in the upper part of the solum; up to 35 percent in the lower part of the solum, and up to 60 percent in the C horizon.  Rock fragments in most pedons consist of small weathered fragments of greenstone rock which commonly break down during mechanical analysis.  Some pedons contain few or common mica flakes in the lower B and C horizons.\nThe A horizon commonly has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4. The A horizon in some pedons has hue of 7.5YR or chroma of 6.  A horizon typically is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam and gravelly stony or very stony analogues.  The Ap horizon, when present, is 6 to 10 inches\nthick.\nThe E or BA, or BE horizon (where present) commonly has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 4. The E horizon typically is silt loam, or loam and gravelly, stony or very stony analogues.\nThe Bt horizon dominantly has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 8. In some pedons, hue is 5YR, with value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 or 6 in some subhorizons. B horizons are silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has colors similar to the Bt horizons. Textures are clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon is porous saprolite that is easily crushed by hand to silt loam, loam, or less commonly silty clay loam. The material is multicolored, or has hue of 10R through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Montalto, Needmore, Oak Level, Peabody, Rasalo, Spray, and Zion series in the same family.  The Needmore, Peabody, and Zion soils are moderately deep to bedrock. The Montalto soils formed in residuum of diabase and gabbro. The Oak Level, Rasalo, and Zion soils are mapped in MLRA 136 (mesic) areas. Also, the Rasalo soils have high shrink swell potential, slow permeability, and browner Bt colors. Also, Oak Level soils formed in clayey residuum of felsic and mafic parent materials. Spray soils formed in Triassic shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Fauquier soils are on undulating to steep uplands with slopes typically between 10 and 25 percent and range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soils developed in weathered multicolored chloritic greenstone schist, metabasalt, and similar material.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F, and average annual rainfall is between 35 and 45 inches.  The average length of the growing season is between 145 and 190 days."

Lew soils formed in colluvium of basic rocks and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the textural control section.

Crops include corn, small grains, alfalfa, orchardgrass, lespedeza, ladino clover, and timothy.  Forested areas consist of white, red, and black oak; hickory, yellow poplar, black locust, walnut, red maple, Virginia pine, dogwood, blackgum, wild cherry, and redbud."

Argillic horizons - The zone from 11 to 37 inches. (Bt horizons).\n6/2004--After some initial confusion as to the proper depth class of the Fauquier series, it has been determined that this soil is dominantly very deep as shown in the type location in Fauquier County, Virginia. The series was originally set up as deep, however this was the practice of that time. At this time, several published NASIS datasets in Virginia need to be checked against the survey publications and corrected to very deep.\nSIR = VA0040, VA0129 (Stony)\nMLRA = 130, 147, 148\nREVISED = 11/23/93, MHC; 2/01 RP; 02/2001, DCH-EPE-MHC;\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
