  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 6 inches or less. Depth to the Ck horizon is 10 inches or less, and it extends to beyond 60 inches. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the A horizon, and from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline in the underlying layers.\nThe A horizon, where present has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt or silt loam.  The A horizon is non-effervescent to slightly effervescent. Calcium carbonate equivelency ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nAn AC or C horizon that is non-effervescent is present in some pedons.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt or silt loam.  Coarse to very coarse, irregular secondary calcium carbonate nodules that are moderately to strongly cemented make up 0 to 12 percent of the Ck horizon by volume.  Clay content ranges from 3 to 15 percent, and silt content ranges from 80 to 95 percent.  The Ck horizon is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent in all parts. Calcium carbonate equivalency ranges from 5 to 40 percent. Few lithochromic mottles in shades of brown, and few silt strippings in shades of gray are present in some pedons.  Few to many whole and broken snail shells are in the Ck horizon in many pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fortadams soils are on the steep to very steep, highly dissected bluff hills section of the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands that border the alluvial plains of the Mississippi River and its tributaries.  They formed in thick deposits of calcareous loess on unstable sideslope positions. Slopes range from 20 to 90 percent.  Elevation ranges from 50 to 550 feet.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 67 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 68 inches.  Annual frost free days range from 200 to 350."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Natchez, Memphis, and Morganfield series.  Natchez soils have a cambic horizon and do not have a substratum layer within a depth of 18 inches that effervesces.  Memphis soils have a fine-silty argillic horizon and are on more stable ridgetop and shoulder positions on the landscape.  Morganfield soils formed in recent alluvial deposits on narrow flood plains."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat excessively drained - Fortadams soils are not saturated within a depth of 6 feet.  Runoff is rapid. Permeability is moderate."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Areas of Fortadams soils are almost entirely in hardwood forest with small areas planted to loblolly pine.  Forest overstory vegetation typically consists of white oak, red oak, eastern cottonwood, cherrybark oak, sweetgum, yellow poplar and loblolly pine.  Understory vegetation generally includes sassafrass, dogwood, eastern redbud, American hornbeam, poison ivy, Virginia creeper, osage orange, longleaf uniola, panicums, and bluestems."
