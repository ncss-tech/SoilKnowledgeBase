  "STATES": "CO,NM,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Farb series consists of shallow and very shallow, excessively or somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum, eolian material, colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Farb soils are on hills, mesas, cuestas, escarpments, canyons and structural benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
