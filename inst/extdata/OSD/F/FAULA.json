  "OVERVIEW": "The Faula series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable upland soils that formed in sandy sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to undulating terraces of the Colorado, Brazos, and Navasota Rivers and their tributaries.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 68 to 72 degrees F.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand and is single grain or has weak granular structure.  This horizon is loose or slightly hard and ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  The E horizon contains few thin lamellae from 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick in some pedons, usually in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the upper part and strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe Bt or E&Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam, but the control section averages loamy fine sand.  The Bt horizons that are continuous horizontally and vertically are less common than the Bt horizons of lamellae.  Where present, the upper part of the continuous Bt horizon is loamy fine sand.  This horizon is dominantly massive, but some pedons have weak subangular blocky structure in the thicker lamellae or in the continuous Bt horizons.  The Bt horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."
