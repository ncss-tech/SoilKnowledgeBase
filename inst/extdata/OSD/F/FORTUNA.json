    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 22 to 45 inches.  The reaction of all horizons is strongly or very strongly acid.\nColor of the A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2) through olive brown (2.5Y 4/4); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) or olive gray (5Y 4/2) through olive (5Y 4/4).  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Structure is weak subangular blocky, weak granular or massive.  The B horizon has colors of dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) through light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) or dark gray (2.5Y 4/; 5Y 4/1), gray (5/ , N6/ ; 5Y 5/1, 6/1) or dark greenish gray (5GY, 5G, 5BG 4/1) through greenish gray (5GY, 5G, 5GB, 6/1).  Mottles are common or many and chromas range from 1 through 8.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  The structure is weak subangular blocky or massive.  Black concretions are few or common.\nThe C horizon has dominant colors with hues of 5Y, and 5GY through 5BG; values of 4 through 7; and chromas of 2 or less.  Mottles are common or many and chromas are 1 through 8.  Texture is clay or silty clay."

The Coloso, Corcega and Talante soils have subhorizons with dominant colors with chromas of 3 or more within 30 inches of the surface.  The Maunabo and Perchas soils have organic matter content that decreases regularly with depth.  The Pinones and Reparada soils have organic layers within 30 inches of the soil surface.  The Santoni soils are calcareous."
