    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 22 to 45 inches.  The reaction of all horizons is strongly or very strongly acid.\nColor of the A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2) through olive brown (2.5Y 4/4); dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) or olive gray (5Y 4/2) through olive (5Y 4/4).  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Structure is weak subangular blocky, weak granular or massive.  The B horizon has colors of dark grayish brown (2.5Y 4/2) through light brownish gray (2.5Y 6/2) or dark gray (2.5Y 4/; 5Y 4/1), gray (5/ , N6/ ; 5Y 5/1, 6/1) or dark greenish gray (5GY, 5G, 5BG 4/1) through greenish gray (5GY, 5G, 5GB, 6/1).  Mottles are common or many and chromas range from 1 through 8.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  The structure is weak subangular blocky or massive.  Black concretions are few or common.\nThe C horizon has dominant colors with hues of 5Y, and 5GY through 5BG; values of 4 through 7; and chromas of 2 or less.  Mottles are common or many and chromas are 1 through 8.  Texture is clay or silty clay."
