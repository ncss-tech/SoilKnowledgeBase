    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  The depth to bedrock is 14 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments are mainly cobbles and pebbles of angular quartzite and range from 20 to 70 percent in the A horizon and 50 to 80 percent in the Bw and C horizons.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at a depth of about 17 inches is 59 to 69 degrees F.  The soil is usually dry for 45 to 60 days in the moisture control section during the summer and is continually moist for 60 to 90 days during the winter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or extremely stony loam with 50 to 80 percent pebbles, cobbles, and stones.  It is slightly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon where present has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to moderately acid."
