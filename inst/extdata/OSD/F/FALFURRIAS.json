  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Falfurrias series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in deep eolian sand deposits of Holocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to steep vegetated dunes on the Sandsheet Prairie of the South Texas Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges mainly from 0 to 8 percent, but range up to 15 percent on hummocky vegetated sand dunes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and mean annual air temperature is about 22.2 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
