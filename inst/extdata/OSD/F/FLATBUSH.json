    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The combined thickness of human transported fill and buried natural solum is 60 cm or more. Thickness of the human transported loamy fill material is 25 to 100 cm. Depth to bedrock is more than 150 cm. Rock fragments, primarily gravel, range from 0 to 35 percent in the A and B horizons and from 5 to 40 percent in C horizons, with a weighted average of less than 35 percent in the control section. Some C horizons, below 100 cm, range from 5 to 60 percent rock fragments. The weighted average of human artifacts in the control sections is less than 10 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe ^A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Textures include sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam and silt loam.  Structure is granular or subangular blocky, but may be fine platy where the surface has been compacted.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe ^Bw horizon has a hue 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. Textures include sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, and silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Pieces of A horizon are commonly mixed in.\nThe ^C horizon has properties similar to the ^Bw, except the horizon is massive or massive with plate-like divisions.\nThe 2Ab horizon, if present, has a hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  Structure is granular or subangular blocky and consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2Bwb, if present, horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  Structure is commonly subangular blocky and consistence is friable or very friable. Some pedons have a thin AB or BA horizon.\nThe 2BC, if present, have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Textures are loamy sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction with coarser texture restricted to the 2BC horizon. They have weak subangular blocky structure or they are massive. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is coarse sand, sand, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction or it is stratified sand and gravel. Some pedons contain strata of loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. The material is generally massive or single grain, and the consistence is friable or very friable.\nIf the 2C horizon starts within 90 cm, textures of the fine earth fraction 12.5 cm above the 2C horizon must be more than 50 percent fine sand and coarser."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Flatbush soils are nearly level to steeply sloping artificially created or modified landforms on outwash plains and water sorted moraines. Depth to sandy outwash materials is deep (100 to 150 centimeters) and outside of the particle size control section.  These soils formed in human transported soil material, with a natural substratum that is either a buried pedon or shows evidence of being a truncated soil. The cap of human transported material is dominantly from locally excavated upland materials and is relatively clean of refuse with less than 10 percent human artifacts. Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 9 to 13 degrees C, mean annual precipitation ranges from 1000 to 1300 mm."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Flatbush soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition; excluding them from the concept of Fluventic Eutrudepts. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy in ICOMANTH Circular Letter 7 developed for anthropogenic soils will help to clarify this difference.\nThe diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 cm (^A horizon)\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 83 cm (^BA, ^Bw, and 2Bw horizons)\n3. Dystric Eutrudepts - base saturation (by NH4OAc) of 60 percent or more in one or more horizons at a depth between 25 and 75 cm from the mineral soil surface; does not have free carbonates within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
