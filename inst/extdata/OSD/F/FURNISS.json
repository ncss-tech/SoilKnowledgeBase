  "OVERVIEW": "The Furniss series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. Furniss soils are on flats, swales and drainageways on valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",

Foxcreek soils can be on similar landforms but are also found on fan remnants and have a contrasting particle size class. Zohner, Zufelt and Zundell soils are found on adjacent mounds.
