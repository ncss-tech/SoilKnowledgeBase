Boquet soils are located in depressions on the same landforms as Furniss soils and have a histic epipedon. Tepete soils are found in adjacent swales and marshes and are histosols. Foxcreek soils can be on similar landforms but are also found on fan remnants and have a contrasting particle size class. Zohner, Zufelt and Zundell soils are found on adjacent mounds. Zohner and Zufelt belong to a calcic subgroup; Zundell soils have a xeric soil moisture regime."
