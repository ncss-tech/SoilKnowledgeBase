  "OVERVIEW": "The Fonner series consists of soils that are moderately deep over mixed sand and gravel.  They are moderately well drained.  Permeability is rapid over very rapid.  They formed in stratified alluvium on bottom lands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 5l degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 25 inches at the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 30 inches in thickness, and the solum ranges from 20 to 34 inches thick.  Typically, free carbonates are lacking in the profile.  In some pedons, carbonates are below a depth of 30 inches.  Depth to the gravelly sand or coarse sand ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of l0YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of l or 2 (dry or moist).  It is typically sandy loam or loam but ranges to silt loam and fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8 and 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of l through 3 (dry or moist).  It is typically gravelly sand, with strata of finer and coarser textured material throughout.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral.  Faint or distinct mottles are in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils are in the Alda, Darr, Inavale, and Lex series.  Alda and Darr soils are coarse-loamy.  In addition, Alda soils are calcareous and Darr soils are somewhat excessively drained.  Inavale soils lack a mollic epipedon and are somewhat excessively drained.  Lex soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy- skeletal, are calcareous, and are somewhat poorly drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fonner soils are on nearly level bottom lands, mainly of large stream valleys.  They formed in stratified loamy and sandy alluvium over mixed sand and gravel.  Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The range of mean annual temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F, and the range of mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches."

Janude and Novina soils are coarse- loamy. Lockton soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Platte soils have coarse sand or gravelly sand at a depth of l2 to 20 inches, are somewhat poorly or poorly drained, and are on slightly lower elevations."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability in the upper part of the control section is rapid; permeability in the lower part is very rapid. The seasonal high water table ranges from a depth of about 3 feet in most wet years to about 6 feet in most dry years.  The water table fluctuates widely, receding to a depth of 8 or l0 feet in the late summer and early fall of some years.  Fonner soils are rarely flooded."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

The remaining acreage is mainly in native grass and used for grazing or hay.  Native vegetation is principally big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and Indiangrass."
