  "REVDATE": "06/2011",
  "STATES": "MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fabius series consist of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy drift on lake plains, outwash plains, valley trains, and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
