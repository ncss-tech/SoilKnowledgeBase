    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fabius soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, beach ridges, and lake plains of Wisconsinan Age. Slopes are dominantly between 0 to 2 percent, but they range up to 6 percent. The Fabius soils formed in sandy and loamy drift. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 12.2 degrees C (47 to 54 degrees F)."

Fabius soils are in a drainage sequence with the somewhat excessively drained Casco and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Mussey soils. Matherton soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Sebewa soils are associated in many places."

Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) from November to May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and high or very high in the lower part. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid or very rapid in the lower part."

A part is in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is lowland hardwoods, chiefly American elm, white ash, and swamp white oak."
