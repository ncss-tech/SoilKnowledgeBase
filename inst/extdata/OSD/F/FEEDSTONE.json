Alonzville, Botetourt, Caverns, Coursey, Ingledove, Shottower, and Sugarhol soils have argillic horizons and are on stream terraces. Broadway, Gullion, and Nomberville soils contain more silt in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Gladehill soils contain less clay in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Derroc soils contain more rock fragment in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Moomaw soils have a fragipan and are on stream terraces. Newmarc soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on similar landscapes."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Cumulic mollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 26 inches. (A and AB horizons)\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 26 to 47 inches. (Bw horizon)\nc. Fluventic feature - irregular organic matter content decrease with depth.\nd. Redoximorphic features - depletions from 36 to 65 inches.\nSoils now within the range of the Feedstone series were correlated as Irongate, Wolfgap and Chagrin soils in several published soil surveys.\nThis soil was originally classified using the 8th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, as a fine-loamy, siliceous, active, mesic Aquic Cumulic Hapludolls. Using the 9th edition of the keys this pedon no longer makes Aquic because the redoximorphic depletions are at a depth greater than 30 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Morphology, chemistry, particle-size distribution, and mineralogy data are available for this pedon (S98VA-017-4) and two additional pedons (S94VA-017-23 and S94VA-017-22).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
