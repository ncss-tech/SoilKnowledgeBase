  "OVERVIEW": "The Fuera series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from sandstone, shale, and acid igneous rocks on hills and mountain slopes. Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
