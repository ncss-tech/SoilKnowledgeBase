    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick.  Mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 50 degrees to 54 degrees F.  These soils are saturated at some season and are continuously moist in some part between depths of 4 and 12 inhes.  The particle-size control section contains 24 to 35 percent clay and calcium carbonate equivalent of 2 to 10 percent.\nThe A11 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  The A12 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  The A horizon is mildly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe upper part of the B2t horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The lower part of the B2t horizon has value of 4, 5, or 6 dry and 2, 3, or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is heavy silt loam or silty clay loam.  The B2t horizon has moderate or strong prismatic structure.  It is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is mildly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Below a depth of 40 inches textures range from silt loam to loamy very fine sand."

They are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  Average January temperature is 29 degrees F., average July temperature is 73 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 51 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
