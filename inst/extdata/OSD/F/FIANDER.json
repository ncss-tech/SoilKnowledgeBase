  "OVERVIEW": "The Fiander series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. Fiander soils are on low terraces and bottomlands.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

These soils are saturated at some season and are continuously moist in some part between depths of 4 and 12 inhes.  The particle-size control section contains 24 to 35 percent clay and calcium carbonate equivalent of 2 to 10 percent.\nThe A11 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  The A12 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  The A horizon is mildly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe upper part of the B2t horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The lower part of the B2t horizon has value of 4, 5, or 6 dry and 2, 3, or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is heavy silt loam or silty clay loam.  The B2t horizon has moderate or strong prismatic structure.  It is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is mildly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Below a depth of 40 inches textures range from silt loam to loamy very fine sand."
