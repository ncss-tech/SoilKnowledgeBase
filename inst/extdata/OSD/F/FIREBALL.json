  "OVERVIEW": "The Fireball series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basalt. Fireball soils are on backslopes and footslopes of hills, mountains and plateaus. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
