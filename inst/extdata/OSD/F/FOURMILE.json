  "STATES": "CO,MT,WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fourmile series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, outwash, and slope alluvium derived mainly from granite.  Fourmile soils are on remnant pediments, stream terraces, alluvial fans, outwash plains, and eskers.  These soils have slopes of 2 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
