  "OVERVIEW": "The Fairway series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, stream terraces, and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The need for documentation in support of the Fluvaquentic subgroup is recognized and should be investigated.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Records - MT0375, MT7046, MT7047.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
