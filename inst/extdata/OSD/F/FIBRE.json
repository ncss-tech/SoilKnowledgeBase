    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 35 inches.  The upper sandy layers are 15 to 25 inches thick and are fine sand, sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction of the upper sandy layers are very strongly acid to neutral.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Some pedons have an Oe horizon instead of an Oa.\nWhere present, the Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Some pedons have a Bhs horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E part of the E/B horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or loamy fine sand.  The B part has value of 4 or 5 and is sandy loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 and is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay or silty clay with thin strata of silt or silt loam.  The thin strata have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons do not have the thin silty strata.  Reaction of the 2C horizon is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification was adjusted to agree with ST Issue l#17 on 6 Sept 94 by CLG.  Based upon the current problems with the chemical requirements for spodosols, the classification of the series was changed from Sideraquods to Haplaquods.  For laboratory data on this pedon, see Michigan Technological University pedon number 85MI-033-3.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.bic horizon - the zone from 5 to 13 inches (E horizon); spodic horizon - the zone from 13 to 17 inches (Bs horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 19 to 27 inches (2Bt horizon); aquic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
