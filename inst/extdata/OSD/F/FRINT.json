  "OVERVIEW": "The Frint series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils formed in colluvium from basalt and  loess influenced by volcanic ash on hillslopes.  Slopes are 45 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual air temperature is 45 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 40 to 65 percent rock fragments. Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 moist.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.
