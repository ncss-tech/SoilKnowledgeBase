The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.20 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 40 to 65 percent rock fragments. Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 moist.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.   It is very gravelly loam and very gravelly silt loam in the upper part and extremely gravelly loam, extremely cobbly silt loam, very cobbly silt loam and extremely cobbly loam in the lower part.
