  "OVERVIEW": "The Ferncat series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from mudstone, sandstone, and siltstone.  Ferncat soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1285 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
