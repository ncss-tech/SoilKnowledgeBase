  "OVERVIEW": "The Fairydell series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and conglomerate. Fairydell soils are on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts. Slopes are 15 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual soil temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
