  "OVERVIEW": "The Felta series is a member of the loamy-skeletal, mixed, thermic family of Pachic Argixerolls.  Typically, Felta soils have grayish brown, slightly acid, very gravelly heavy loam A horizons and grayish brown, slightly acid, very gravelly clay loam B2t horizons underlain by gravelly old alluvium at a depth of about 24 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 degrees to 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47degrees F. at any time.  The soil between depths of 8 to 20 inches is usually dry from June 15 until October 15 and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year. Rock fragments of rounded pebbles and cobbles make up about 50 to 90 percent of the volume of the soil.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown or brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue and has value of 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma is 2 or 3 both dry and moist.  It is loam or heavy loam, and has moderate or weak subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has colors similar to the A horizon.  It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is slightly hard or hard and is slightly acid or moderately acid. The C horizon is pale brown to light brownish gray in 10YR hue and has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately acid or strongly acid."

The soils formed in mixed gravelly alluvium from mixed igneous rocks.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  Average January temperature is 47 degrees F.; average July temperature is 67 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F. The freeze-free season is 220 to 280 days."

Guenoc soils have ochric epipedons and have fine kaolinitic control sections with hue of 2.5YR or redder. Hambright and Kidd soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches.
