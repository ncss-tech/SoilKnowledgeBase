  "OVERVIEW": "The Felta series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed volcanic alluvium and basic metamorphic rocks.  Felta soils are on dissected terraces of the Coast Range of Northern California.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches (760 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F (15 degrees C).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 65 degrees F (15 to 18 degrees C) and the soil temperature usually is not below 47degrees F (8 degrees C) at any time.  The soil between depths of 8 to 20 inches (20 to 50 cm) is usually dry from June 15 until October 15 and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year. Rock fragments of rounded pebbles and cobbles make up about 50 to 90 percent of the volume of the soil.\nTypically, Felta soils have grayish brown, slightly acid, very gravelly heavy loam A horizons and grayish brown, slightly acid, very gravelly clay loam Bt horizons underlain by gravelly old alluvium at a depth of about 24 inches.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown or brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue and has value of 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma is 2 or 3 both dry and moist.  It is loam or heavy loam, and has moderate or weak subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has colors similar to the A horizon.  It has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is slightly hard or hard and is slightly acid or moderately acid. The C horizon is pale brown to light brownish gray in 10YR hue and has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately acid or strongly acid."

Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches (635 to 1015 mm).  Average January temperature is 47 degrees F (8 degrees C); average July temperature is 67 degrees F (19 degrees C); mean annual air temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F (15 to 17 degrees C).
