  "OVERVIEW": "The Fortsage series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Fortsage soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
