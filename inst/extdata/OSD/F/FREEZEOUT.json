The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from March 15 to November 15 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from April 15 to October 30. The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section (12 to 25 inches) from July 25 to October 1 and is moist in all parts from December 15 to May 30.  The particle-size control section (10 to 25 inches) ranges from 10 to 18 percent clay.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Reaction of the solum is slightly acid through very strongly acid and base saturation ranges from 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 5/3 or 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/2 or 2/2.  It is a gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Total rock fragments range from 20 to 55 percent.  Stones and cobbles make up 0 to 10 percent and gravel makes up 20 to 45 percent.\nThe Bw2 horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 6/4 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 4/4.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Total rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent.  Stones and cobbles make up 0 to 20 percent and gravel make up 35 to 60 percent."
