Depth to bedrock is more than 150 cm.  The A horizon and upper part of the Bt horizon range from less than 1 percent to 6 percent of subangular rounded quartz pebbles and\nrange from 15 to 30 percent at the contact of the unconforming material.  The lower part of the Bt horizon is commonly free of pebbles.  Some pedons have flakes of mica throughout the soil.\nThese soils are very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of\n2 through 6.  The A2 horizon, when present, includes chroma of 8.  The A horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon, above the unconforming materials, has hue of 7.5YR\nor 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 6 or 8.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay.\nThe IIB horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through\n6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Some pedons have high chroma mottles.\nIt is silty clay loam, clay loam, clay or silt loam in the\nfine-earth fraction.\nThe IIIB horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and\nchroma of 6 or 8.  It has high chroma mottles and is silty clay\nloam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon is multicolored, very strongly weathered schist or gneiss.  It is sandy loam, silt loam, loam or clay loam."

Agnos, Boden, Gassville, Groseclose, Muse, Pervinia, Sequoia, and Trappist soils have coarse fragments of sedimentary rocks.  Appling soils do not have a lithologic discontinuity in the control section.  Braddock soils have red B2 horizons.  Howell and Monmouth soils have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y in the lower part of the B horizon.  Unison soils have coarse fragments\nof dominantly rounded and subrounded greenstone and granodiorate."

The upper part of the solum is formed in a silty fluvial mantle and the lower part is formed in residuum weathered from\nschist and gneiss.  The mean annual temperature is 13 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 107 cm."
