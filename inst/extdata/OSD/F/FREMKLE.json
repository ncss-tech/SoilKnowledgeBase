The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

P-retention is about 60 percent.  The glass and glass-coated aggregate in the very fine sand fraction is about 70 percent.  Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is about 0.45 percent.  The 15-bar water on both dried and undried samples is less than 10 percent.\nAsh deposit is from Mt. Mazama.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
