    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fangio soils are located on linear to slightly convex upper backslopes of eroded fan remnants nested on undulating plateaus.  They are formed in mixed alluvium mostly from Precambrian Age granite, gneiss, and schist with minor amounts of localized Triassic Age sandstone and shale over residuum weathered from shale.  They are on slopes of 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 6,600 to 8,000 feet, mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 48 degrees, and mean annual precipitation typically ranges from 14 to 16 inches with the peak periods occurring from July through September and December through March. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

Ortiz soils are fine, do not have a calcic horizon, and are on lower backslopes of eroded fan remnants. Predawn soils are fine-loamy, have an abrupt textural change to the argillic horizon, and are on summits of eroded fan remnants."
