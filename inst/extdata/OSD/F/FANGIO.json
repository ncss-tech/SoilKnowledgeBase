  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fangio series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed from mixed alluvium and colluvium of mostly granite, gneiss, and schist with fewer amounts of sedimentary rocks over residuum derived from shale on upper backslopes of eroded fan remnants.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

They are on slopes of 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 6,600 to 8,000 feet, mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 48 degrees, and mean annual precipitation typically ranges from 14 to 16 inches with the peak periods occurring from July through September and December through March.
