  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Clay content in the fine-earth fraction of the\nupper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is 35 to 60 percent.  Siliceous pebbles and a few cobbles comprise 35 to 75 percent of the upper\n20 inches of the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, brown, yellowish brown, or pale\nbrown in hues of 7.5YR and 10YR with value of 5 and 6, and chroma\nof 2 through 4.  It is gravelly or very gravelly sandy loam or gravelly or very gravelly loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from\nneutral through medium acid.\nThe E horizon is pale brown, very pale brown, or light brown in\nhue of 7.5YR and 10YR with value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 2 through\n4.  Texture and reaction are the same as the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is prominently or distinctly mottled in shades of\nred, yellow, brown, and gray in hues of 2.5YR through 10YR.  The fine-earth fraction is clay or sandy clay.  The reaction is\nneutral through strongly acid.  The lower Bt horizon and Bw\nhorizon contain 5 to 40 percent siliceous pebbles and cobbles.\nThe fine-earth fraction is sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay\nwith 25 to 42 percent clay.  Secondary accumulation of calcium carbonate occur in some pedons at depth of 50 to 80 inches.\nReaction is medium acid through moderately alkaline.  Shaly clay occurs at depths below 60 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.\nSimilar soils include Axtell, Chaney, Crockett, Hornsby, Riesel, Selden, and Tabor series.  All of these soils except Hornsby and Riesel soils and have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Hornsby soils have less than 35 percent clay in\nthe fine-earth fraction of the Bt horizon.  Riesel soils lack low chroma mottles due to wetness."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fett soils occur on nearly level to strongly sloping uplands ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent and the surfaces are plane to convex.  The soil formed in a gravelly\nmantle of ancient outwash like those of the Uvalde formation that were deposited over calcareous shaly clay.  The climate is moist subhumid.  Annual rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches.\nThornthwaite P-E indices range from 42 to 55.  Mean average annual temperature ranges from 67 to 70 degrees F."
