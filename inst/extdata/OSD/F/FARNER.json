Texture ranges from sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. It has the same range of textures as the A horizon.\nThe AB or BA horizons, where present, have hue of  5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture ranges from loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. At least part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. Texture ranges from loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC or CB horizons, where present, are similar in color and texture to the AB or BA horizons.\nThe C horizon is multicolored saprolite in shades of red, brown, and yellow.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brasstown, Hickoryknob, Junaluska, and Sauratown  soil series.  Except for Brasstown and  Junaluska, none of the competing series formed in residuum weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as metagraywacke or metasandstone. Junaluska soils have paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and Brasstown soils at 40 to 60 inches. Hickoryknob and Sauratown soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Farner soils are on gently and strongly sloping ridges and moderately steep side slopes of intermountain hills in the Southern Blue Ridge (MLRA 130B) mountains. Elevation ranges from approximately 1,500 to 2,200 feet. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Farner soils formed in residuum weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as metagraywacke and metasandstone primarily in the Copperhill and Ammons geologic formations of North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia. Near the type location mean annual air temperature is about 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches."

Nantahala soils are 40 to 60 inches to paralithic contact and  have a clayey Bt horizon. Soco soils are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact and Stecoah soils are 40 to 60 inches . They do not have an argillic horizon and occur on short steep and very steep side slopes."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of this soil is in forest. Common trees are scarlet oak, chestnut oak, white oak, black oak, and hickory, with some Virginia pine, pitch pine, shortleaf pine, and eastern white pine. The understory includes flowering dogwood, rhododendron, mountain-laurel, sourwood, buffalo nut, black gum, and red maple. About one third of this soil is in pasture and hay land."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The soils now placed in the Farner series were previously included in the Evard and Hayesville series. However, Farner soils are derived from and have fragments of low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as metagraywacke. Evard and Hayesville soils are derived from and contain fragments of high-grade metamorphic rocks such as hornblende gneiss or mica gneiss.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - 0 to 8 inches (Oe and A horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 12 to 32 inches (Bt horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data from the typifying pedon were obtained from the North Carolina State University, College of Agriculture and Life Sciences.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
