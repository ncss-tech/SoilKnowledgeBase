  "OVERVIEW": "The Fizzleflat series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils over slowly permeable limestone or shale bedrock.  These nearly level to gently undulating soils are on upland plains and pediments.  They formed in residuum and pedisediment derived from the Cretaceous age Pen Clay Formation.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.",

They are on similar upland plains and pediments.   Cheosa soils are very shallow and shallow to a cemented conglomerate petrocalcic horizon, and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Cheosa soils are higher in the landscape on hillcrests underlain by the Jeff Conglomerate member of the Pruett Formation.  Loyplace soils are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  They are on slightly higher, footslope landforms.  Mariscal soils are very shallow and shallow to Boquillas Flags limestone bedrock located on adjacent hills.  Straddlebug soils are very deep, loamy soils lower in the landscape on alluvial flats and floodplains.  They formed in zeolitic alluvium derived from tuffaceous formations."
