  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fizzleflat soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping upland plains and pediments.  These soils formed in residuum and pedisediment derived from the Cretaceous Pen Clay Formation.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches, with most occurring in the summer months.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 210 to 260 days.  Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cesario, Cheosa, Loyplace, Mariscal, and Straddlebug series.  Cesario soils are deep to shale bedrock.  They are on similar upland plains and pediments.   Cheosa soils are very shallow and shallow to a cemented conglomerate petrocalcic horizon, and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Cheosa soils are higher in the landscape on hillcrests underlain by the Jeff Conglomerate member of the Pruett Formation.  Loyplace soils are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon and are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  They are on slightly higher, footslope landforms.  Mariscal soils are very shallow and shallow to Boquillas Flags limestone bedrock located on adjacent hills.  Straddlebug soils are very deep, loamy soils lower in the landscape on alluvial flats and floodplains.  They formed in zeolitic alluvium derived from tuffaceous formations."
