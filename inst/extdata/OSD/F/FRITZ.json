  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Canyoung, Gepton (T), Skibo, Zeale and Zeelnot series.  Canyoung soils have 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the less than 2 mm size fraction of the mineralogy control section and have a mean summer soil temperature of 12.2 to 15.0 degrees C.  The Gepton series from Idaho is not clearly separated from the Fritz and Zeale series.  This will be addressed when the Clark County Area Soil Survey is reactivated.  There is a recommendation in the text of the Zeale series description that Gepton and Zeale are very similar and perhaps correlate Gepton into Zeale.  Skibo soils have greater than 5 percent stones.  Zeale soils are dry in all parts for greater than 100 consecutive days in the four months following the summer solstice.  Zeelnot soils have 25 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Fritz soils occur on high relief, south facing mountain slopes and alpine summits.  Slopes range from 4 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 1,585 to 3,353 meters.  The soil formed in colluvium derived from limestone and loess.  The mean annual precipitation is about 406 to 610 cm.  It dominantly occurs as snow, rain or fog in the late autumn through early summer.  A winter snowpack of 30 to 91 cm lasting through February or March is common.  Summers are warm and dry.  The mean annual air temperature is 2.8 to 6.1 degrees C.  The frost free season is 30 to 70 days."

They average less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the mineralogy control section and have forest litter layers.  Meegero soils occur on adjacent mountain slopes and hills.  They have mollic epipedons greater than 41 cm thick.  Zeale soils occur on adjacent fan remnants and hills.  They are dry for longer periods during the summer and early autumn."

On mountain side slopes positions, these soils dominantly support the limberpine/spiked fescue plant association, mountain big sagebrush/bluebunch wheatgrass communities or communities dominated by curlleaf mountain mahogany.  On alpine summit positions the Fritz soils support communities dominated by alpine grasses and sedges."
