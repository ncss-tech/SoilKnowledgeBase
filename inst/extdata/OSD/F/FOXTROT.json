  "STATES": "NM,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Foxtrot series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slow above and below the very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon soils formed in eolian sands over alluvium. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on basin floors. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
