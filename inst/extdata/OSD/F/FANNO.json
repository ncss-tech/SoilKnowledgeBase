Slopes are dominantly 5 to 12 percent but range up to 20 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from clayey shales, siltstones, and possibly sandstone.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F. and the frost-free season ranges from 170 to 220 days."
