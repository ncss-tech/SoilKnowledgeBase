  "OVERVIEW": "The Fanno series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from clayey shales, siltstones, and possibly sandstone on upland hills. Slopes are 5 to 20 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual temperature is 54 degrees F.",
