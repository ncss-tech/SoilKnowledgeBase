  "OVERVIEW": "The Forgotten series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, and till derived from granitic rocks. The Forgotten soils are on high gradient drainageways on mountain slopes, moraines, and glacial valley walls of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
