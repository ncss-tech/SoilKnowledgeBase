  "OVERVIEW": "The Flue series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in a surficial mantle of loess and volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Flue soils are on fan remnants and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
