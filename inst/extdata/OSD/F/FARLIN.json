  "REVDATE": "04/2014",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Farlin series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from limestone.  These soils occur on fan remnants, hills, mountain slopes, ridges, escarpments, and landslides.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 490 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
