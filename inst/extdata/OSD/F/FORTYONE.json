  "OVERVIEW": "The Fortyone series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium of Pleistocene age. These very gently sloping to moderately steep soils occur on hillslopes, stream terraces, and terrace remnants on dissected plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in) and mean annual temperature is about 15.0 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
