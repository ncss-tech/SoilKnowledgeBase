Doughspon soils do not have a xeric moisture regime.  Hamtah soils have average annual soil temperature warmer than 43 degrees F, have slightly alkaline reaction in the Bt3 horizons and have much of the original rock structure in the lower Bt horizon.  Urwill soils formed in less than 16 inches of\nprecipitation and have a dry color value of 6 in the surface layer.  Winnemucca soils are 24 to 42 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon and developed in 25 to 30 inches of precipitation."
