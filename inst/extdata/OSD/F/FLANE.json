  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from tuffaceous sandstone and siltstone and basalt.  The soils have a humid climate with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches, which occurs as rain in the spring and autumn and as rain and snow in the winter.  The mean January temperature is 35 degrees F, mean July temperature is 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
