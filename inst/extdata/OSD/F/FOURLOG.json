  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 60 inches thick.   Typically these soils are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches and are noncalcareous to depths of at least 40 inches in all pedons.  Thin organic horizons generally occur at the surface of this soil but may be absent in some pedons.  The content of organic carbon in the mineral portion of the soil ranges from about .6 to 5 percent and decreases uniformly with depth.  The control section is typically light loam and contains 5 to 18 percent clay, 30 to 60 percent silt, and 25 to 60 percent sand, with less than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and generally become more numerous in the lower part of the control section.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 33 degrees to 46 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 58 degrees F.  These soils have high water tables and are moist throughout most of the control section most seasons of the year.  The A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry or 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2.  It has common medium distinct to many large prominent mottles in the lower part.  This horizon typically has granular or crumb primary structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline (pH 6.1 to 7.8).  The B2g horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry or 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of neutral to 2.  It contains common medium distinct to many large prominent contrasting mottles.  This horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline (pH 6.1 to 7.8)."

Braymill soils lack a mollic epipedon, have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand throughout the control section and contain a significant amount of pumice.  Roseberry soils are strongly or very strongly acid, and have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand, much of which is medium coarse angular granite sand throughout the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Fourlog soils are on the lower ends and concave areas of alluvial fans and sideslopes.  Slopes typically range from 0 to about 10 or more percent.  The soil formed in thick, noncalcareous, alluvial fan materials derived from mixed crystalline rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 30 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 33 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 46 degrees F."
