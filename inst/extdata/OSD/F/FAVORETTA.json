    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 45 to more than 80 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to mildly alkaline in the A horizon and from medium acid to moderately alkaline in the Btg and Cg horizons.  Weighted average silt content in the particle size control section ranges from 20 to 30 percent.  Weighted average clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1; or it is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Mottles of red, yellow or brown are in some pedons.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 4.  Where value is 3 or less, combined thickness of the A and upper part of the Btg horizon is less than 24 inches.  The lower part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2; hue of 2.5Y with value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2; hue of 5Y, with value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1; or is neutral with value of 4 or 5.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow or olive are in most pedons.  Clay films on vertical faces of peds are very few or few and distinct or prominent; texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nSome pedons have a Btgk horizon.  Where present, it has colors and textures similar to the Btg horizon.  Nodules or soft accumulations of irregular or rounded, light gray or gray, calcium carbonates range from few to many and from fine to coarse.  Thickness ranges from 31 to 41 inches.\nSome pedons have a Cg or Cgk horizon at depths of more than 45 inches.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR with value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 1 or 2; hue of 2.5Y with value of 5 and chroma of 2; hue of 5Y with value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of 5GY with value of 5 and chroma of 1.  Texture ranges from sandy clay loam to sand.  The Cgk horizon, additionally, has nodules of soft accumulations of calcium carbonate as described for the Btgk horizon."
