  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fourcorners soils are on fan remnants and ballenas. Slope ranges from 4 to 30 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevations are 2,000 to 3,000 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation occurs in winter but a significant portion is received between July and September following convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 5 inches; mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Arizo, Dalvord, Goldroad, and Nellake soils. Arizo soils do not have an argillic horizon, have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section, and are on inset fans and alluvial fans. Dalvord and Goldroad soils do not have an argillic horizon and are found on adjacent mountains. In addition, Goldroad soils have a hyperthermic soil temperature regime. Nellake soils are very deep and are found on similar landscapes and fan piedmonts."
