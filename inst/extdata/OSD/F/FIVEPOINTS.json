  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The clayey pedisediment is of uncertain origin.  It is thought to be a depositional feature and is locally referred as the \"Rountree Formation\". The pedisediment in Fivepoints is locally referred to as thin Rountree. It is high in clay like the classic Rountree but generally has brown colors and less coarse fragments than the soils with thicker Rountree materials.  It is felt that a horizon is always present consisting of residuum from the underlying bedrock.  This horizon can vary in thickness depending upon the position of the soil; lower shoulders often have thicker horizons than summits.  In Dane County, Wisconsin, the Dunbarton series will be correlated as Fivepoints on the update as a residuum layer will be recognized overlying the bedrock.  The Dunbarton series was mapped on both the Shakopee and Galena Formations.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon: 0 to 18 centimeters(Ap);\nargillic horizon: 18 to 89 centimeters (Bt1, 2Bt2, 3Bt3);\nstrongly contrasting particle size classes within the control section 18 to 69 centimeters\nlithic contact:89 centimeters (3Rt)\nADDITIONAL DATA: None available at this time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
