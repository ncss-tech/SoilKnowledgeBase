Bonnick, Borobey, Emamount, Embal, Gardone, and Picturerock soils are very deep.  Stookmoor soils have firm, brittle horizons within 50 cm of the soil surface.  Oatmanflat and Tuffcabin soils are deep to buried duripans.  Wegert soils have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section and have subhorizons above the lithic contact with greater than 40 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frentera soils are on hills and plateaus.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in eolian deposits derived from volcanic ash and colluvium derived from tuff.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 2,000 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
