  "OVERVIEW": "The Frentera series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived from volcanic ash and colluvium derived from tuff.  Frentera soils are on hills and plateaus.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

These soils formed in eolian deposits derived from volcanic ash and colluvium derived from tuff.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 2,000 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
