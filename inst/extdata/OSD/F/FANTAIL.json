  "OVERVIEW": "The Fantail series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in materials derived from shale. Fantail soils are on hills from uplifted marine deposited sediments on islands. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees F. (19 degrees C.)",

The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about mid-August to mid-November (about 90 days) and is usually moist the rest of the time.\nDepth to bedrock ranges from 16 to 43 inches (40 to 110 centimeters) but is best represented by 20 to 40 inches (50 to 100 centimeters).\nMollic epipedon thickness ranges from 8 to 35 inches (20 to 90 centimeters) but is best represented by 20 to 30 inches (50 to 76 centimeters). Mollic epipedon thickness is highly variable due to disturbance by animals, mainly wild pigs, and erosion.\nThe particle size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay, and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nOrganic matter ranges from 1 to 4 percent to a depth of at least 20 inches (50 centimeters).\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/1, 3/2, or 3/1. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/2, 2/2, or 2/1.\nThe Bw horizon is absent in pedons that have been highly disturbed by animals, mainly wild pigs.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 4/2, or 4/3. Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 3/4, 3/3, 3/2, 3/1 or 2/2.\nClay content averages from 40 to 60 percent.\nRock fragments average from 35 to 60 percent.\nThin surface phases exist in areas where the surface layer has been eroded."
