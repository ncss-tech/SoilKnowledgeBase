  "OVERVIEW": "The Fezip series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over flood deposited sand and gravel. Fezip soils are on flood plains.  Permeability is moderately rapid over very rapid. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
