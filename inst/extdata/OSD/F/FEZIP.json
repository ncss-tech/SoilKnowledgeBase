Copperbasin soils are on floodplains, are somewhat poorly drained and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Lilylake soils are on floodplains and have histic epipedons and sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.   Redfish soils are on floodplains and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Wiggleton soils are on fan terraces, outwash fans and stream terraces.  Wiggleton soils have mollic epipedons that are 10 to 16 inches thick and have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections."
