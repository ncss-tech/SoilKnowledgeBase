  "STATES": "IL,IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Flagler series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of moderately coarse-textured alluvium and the underlying coarse-textured alluvium. These soils occur on treads and risers on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters.",
