  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the sandy dredge material is greater than 100 cm and is sourced from coastal waterways, bays, or rivers. Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent. Some pedons contain shell fragments. Human artifacts range from 0 to 10 percent. Soil textures range loamy fine sand or coarser. Some pedons may include horizons with stratified textures. Pockets of clay or peat may be present in some pedons. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Structure is weak very fine granular, with low organic matter accumulations or weak very fine subangular blocky structure. Consistence is very friable.\nThe ^E horizon, if present, has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is typically weak very fine subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable.\nThe ^B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. It is typically weak very fine subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable.\nThe ^C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3. This horizon is typically single grained or massive. Consistence is very friable."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fortress soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping artificially-created or human-altered landforms. These soils formed in human-transported soil material from dredging activities of nearby shorelines, waterways, bays, or rivers, in and near major urbanized areas of the Northeast. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1020 to 1325 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

The well to excessively drained Bigapple, somewhat poorly drained Barren, and poorly drained Jamaica soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Breeze soils contain more than 10 percent (by volume) human artifacts throughout.  Hooksan soils formed in sandy eolian deposits. Ipswich, Matunuck, Pawcatuck, and Sandyhook are subject to tidal flooding. Verrazano soils have a contrasting particle size class within the control section."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the surface and very high in the subsoil and substratum. Some pedons near the shoreline may be subject to coastal flooding during severe storm events."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Water table monitoring at the type location site suggests aquic conditions exist in the ^Cg1 horizon.  This depth to aquic conditions and associated low chroma matrix colors in the ^Cg1 are used as criteria in classifying the pedon as Aquic Udipsamments.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 20 cm (^A horizon).\n2. Psamments - the zone from 25 to 100 cm is fine sand or sand and averages less than 35 percent rock fragments (^Bw, ^C, and part of ^Cg1 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Full characterization data for sample no. S1999NY047003. Pedon analyzed by the KSSL, Lincoln, NE, 1999. Characterization data for Fortress and similar soils is available through the National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
