  "OVERVIEW": "The Freeland series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with a fragipan.  These soils are on stream terraces in the Coastal Plain region.  The soils formed in a mantle of loess and underlying loamy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Near the type location, average annual precipitation is 61 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is 54 inches.",

Hatchie and Woodmont soils have mottles with chroma 2 or less throughout the B horizon.  Byram, Dulac, Gigger, Loring and Providence do not have layers with at least a 3 percent decrease in clay immediately above the fragipan.
