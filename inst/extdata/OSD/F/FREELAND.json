  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 or more inches.  Depth to layers containing more than 15 percent sand is less than 48 inches.  Depth to fragipan commonly ranges from 24 to 40 inches, but may be as shallow as 18 inches in severely eroded areas.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the upper part of the solum except where lime has been added.  The lower part of the solum ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Eroded areas have surface layers with chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles in shades of yellow or brown range from none to common.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E part of the E/B horizon, and  E horizon where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 or less.  Mottles of higher chroma range from none to common.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btx horizon, in most pedons, has a mottled matrix.  Mottles have hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y, values of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 6.  In some pedons, the Btx horizon and Btx part of the E/B horizon have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles of brown, yellow, and gray range from common to many in the Btx horizon. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe 2Btx horizon has colors and textures similar to the Btx.  Texture is fine sandy loam, clay loam, and sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, is stratified sandy and loamy sediments.  Colors are similar to the Btx horizon.  Texture of strata ranges from loamy sand to clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Bude, Byram, Calloway, Dulac, Duralde, Gigger, Grenada, Hatchie, Loring, Necessity, Paden, Providence and Woodmont soils are in related families.  All of these, except the Hatchie and Woodmont soils, have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Loring and Grenada soils contain less than 10 percent sand in the control section; and Bude, Calloway, and Necessity soils have mottles of chroma 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the B horizon or within 16 inches of the surface. Hatchie and Woodmont soils have mottles with chroma 2 or less throughout the B horizon.  Byram, Dulac, Gigger, Loring and Providence do not have layers with at least a 3 percent decrease in clay immediately above the fragipan.  Duralde soils have fragic properties but do not have a fragipan.  Paden soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent."
