  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 40 inches. The A horizon and the upper part of the Btg horizon range from very strongly acid to moderately acid, except for the surface layer in areas that have been limed. The lower part of the Btg horizon and the Cg horizon range from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline. Black and brown concretions, if present, are few to common.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less. Some pedons have thin A horizons with values of 3 or less. Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe upper Btg horizon has a matrix with 60 percent or more in hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, and either value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1, or value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; iron accumulations are in shades of brown or yellow. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. The upper 20 inches has 35 to 60 percent clay and less than 20 percent sand. The lower Btg has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, and iron accumulations in shades of brown or yellow. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a BCg horizon with colors, textures, and reaction similar to the lower Btg horizon.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has the same colors as the Btg horizon. It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Forestdale soils are on natural levees or low terraces bordering former channels of the Mississippi River and its tributaries. These are level to gently sloping soils with mainly smooth surfaces. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The soil formed in clayey and silty alluvial sediments. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual precipitation is 53 inches near the type location."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Alligator, Amagon, Bosket, Dubbs, Dundee, Tensas, Tunica and Tutwiler series. The poorly drained Alligator, Amagon, and Tunica soils are on similar landscapes positions. The well drained Bosket, Dubbs, and Tutwiler soils are on higher positions on terraces and natural levees. The somewhat poorly drained Dundee and Tensas soils are in intermediate positions on terraces and in swales."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained; negligible to very high runoff depending on slope; very slow permeability. These soils have a water table at a depth of 0.5 to 2 feet below the surface in wet seasons from January to April. These soils are subject to flooding during late winter and early spring unless\nprotected."
