  "OVERVIEW": "The Forestdale series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey and silty alluvium. These soils are on low terraces or natural levees bordering former channels of the Mississippi River and its major tributaries in the Southern Mississippi Valley Alluvium Major Land Resource Area (131). They are saturated late in winter and early in spring. Water runs off the surface very slowly. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 40 inches. The A horizon and the upper part of the Btg horizon range from very strongly acid to moderately acid, except for the surface layer in areas that have been limed. The lower part of the Btg horizon and the Cg horizon range from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline. Black and brown concretions, if present, are few to common.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less. Some pedons have thin A horizons with values of 3 or less. Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe upper Btg horizon has a matrix with 60 percent or more in hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, and either value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1, or value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; iron accumulations are in shades of brown or yellow. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. The upper 20 inches has 35 to 60 percent clay and less than 20 percent sand. The lower Btg has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, and iron accumulations in shades of brown or yellow. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a BCg horizon with colors, textures, and reaction similar to the lower Btg horizon.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has the same colors as the Btg horizon. It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam."

These are level to gently sloping soils with mainly smooth surfaces. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The soil formed in clayey and silty alluvial sediments. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual precipitation is 53 inches near the type location."

The poorly drained Alligator, Amagon, and Tunica soils are on similar landscapes positions. The well drained Bosket, Dubbs, and Tutwiler soils are on higher positions on terraces and natural levees. The somewhat poorly drained Dundee and Tensas soils are in intermediate positions on terraces and in swales."
