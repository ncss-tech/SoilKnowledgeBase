  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and the depth to weathered bedrock are 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments between the depths of 10 to 30 inches are mainly pebbles and average 10 to 35 percent by volume.  Stones and cobbles cover about 3 to 15 percent of the surface area and occur in the upper 12 to 18 inches, but become fewer in number with increasing depth.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature varies from 50 degrees to 54 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist between depths of 10 and 28 inches and are dry in all parts only from early August until early October.  The base saturation between depths of 9 and 37 inches is 35 to 50 percent.  Mineralogy between depths of 10 and 30 inches is mixed but is influenced by vitric pyroclastic material.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 3/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/4 or 5.4 and moist color of 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/4 3/3 or 5YR 3/4.  It is sandy loam or loam and is modified by 15 to 30 percent gravel by volume.  It is slightly acid to strongly acid and has 5 to 7 percent organic matter. The surface horizon does not qualify as an umbric horizon.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/4, 6/6; 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4; 5YR 6/3 or 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 3/4; 7.5YR 4/2, 3/4, 4/4; 5YR 3/4 or 4/4.   It is loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay.  This horizon has weak or moderate subangular and angular blocky structure.  It is moderately acid to very strongly acid."

The Fan Lake soils are very deep, have fragic properties beteen a depth of 20 to 40 inches and have perched water table at its uppermost limit from January through February with redox concentrations within 20 to 40 inches. Henneway soils have slightly fractured hard phyllite bedrock contact between 40 and 60 inches.  Neva soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock. Tahand soils have soft bedrock ranging from 40 inches to 60 inches deep."

Slopes are 2 to 50 percent, but are mainly less than 30 percent.  Fugawee soils formed in material weathered from basic volcanic flows, breccias and agglomerates.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 degrees to 44 degrees F., mean January temperature is 24 degrees F. and mean July temperature is 59 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 30 to 80 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The type location was moved in 2003 from the Lake Tahoe Basin to the present location in Washoe County NV. The classification was changed from an Ultic Haploxeralf at that time.\nThe Fugawee soils were originally classified as members of the fine-loamy, mixed family of Mollic Cryoboralfs.  The cryic soil temperature regime was based upon a rule of thumb that 0 horizons are not considered unless the thickness is greater than 3 inches.  This concept is not considered to be valid in California and conflicts with Soil Taxonomy.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
