Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches with about 40 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."

Espanola soils are loamy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons or argillic horizons, and occur on adjacent risers of high stream terraces. Morenda soils are coarse-loamy, have water tables within 5 feet, and occur on low stream terraces of valley floors. Posada soils are coarse-loamy, lack argillic horizons, and occur on inset fans of valley sides."
