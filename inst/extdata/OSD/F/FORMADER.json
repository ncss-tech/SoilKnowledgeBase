These soils have formed in loamy colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or coarse-grained intrusive rock. Elevations are typically 200 to 1,800 feet but range to 2,400 feet in Lane County, Oregon. The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 120 inches. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. The mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 61 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 220 days."

Bohannon soils are fine-loamy and have a surface layer less than 14 inches thick which meets Andic subgroup criteria. Blachly soils are fine textured and more than 60 inches deep to bedrock. Harslow soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Hembre soils are fine-loamy and more than 40 inches deep to basalt. Klickitat soils are loamy-skeletal and are more than 40 inches deep to basalt. Kilchis soils are loamy-skeletal and are less than 20 inches deep to basalt. Klistan soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic features in this pedon include:\nUmbric epipedon - from the surface to 19 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon - from 19 to 34 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nAndic soil properties - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 19 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - from 1 to 34 inches with the zone from 1 to 19 inches meeting andic soil properties and medial family and the zone from 19 to 34 inches meeting a contrasting loamy family. Below a depth of approximately 19 inches, andic soil properties are absent primarily due to reduced organic matter and higher bulk density.\nDepth to diagnostic horizons and features is measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nClassification revised 9/03 from Medial over loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Dystrandepts to Medial over loamy, ferrihydritic over isotic, mesic Alic Hapludands. This reclassification is based on the addition of the Andisol Order to Soil Taxonomy.\nFurther investigation may be needed where the series in recognized above 1,800 feet. This elevation has historically been considered the transition to the frigid soil temperature regime within the central to northern Coast Range Mountains."
