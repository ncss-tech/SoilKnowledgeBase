  "OVERVIEW": "The Farmer series consists of very deep and deep to a duripan, well drained soils formed in mixed loess and volcanic ash over older loess. They are on nonglaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 13 inches and average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

One or more horizons in the top 30 inches of the profile, including the surface horizon in all cases, has a base saturation of 75 to less by sum of bases. The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Some pedons have accumulations of secondary lime below 44 inches. When present, depth to a weak or moderately cemented duripan is 40 to 60 or more inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe BA horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loam or ashy silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist.

The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Average January temperature is about 26 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 70 degrees F., and average annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 165 days."
