These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, including 10 to 30 percent pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.35 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 0 to 5 percent pebbles, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 5 to 14 percent.  One or more horizons in the top 30 inches of the profile, including the surface horizon in all cases, has a base saturation of 75 to less by sum of bases. The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Some pedons have accumulations of secondary lime below 44 inches. When present, depth to a weak or moderately cemented duripan is 40 to 60 or more inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe BA horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy loam or ashy silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 3Bt horizon reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

These soils formed in post-Wisconsin age loess mixed with volcanic ash overlying pre-Wisconsin age loess. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. Average January temperature is about 26 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 70 degrees F., and average annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 165 days."

Nemire soils are in drainageways and depressions, are ashy, and have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick. Norax soils are on knoll tops and shoulder slopes of uplands, have an ochric epipedon, and are fine silty."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are a mollic epipedon from 0 to 11 inches and 5 to 25 percent pumice with an estimated 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass from the surface to 19 inches, and a coarse-silty argillic horizon from 19 to 60 inches. Base saturation by sum of bases is 56 percent from the surface to 11 inches. The particle size control section is the upper argillic horizon from 19 to 39 inches (the 2Bt1 and most of the 2Bt2 horizons). The particle-size control section averages 13 percent clay and 83 percent silt plus very fine sand. Coarse silt is the dominant fraction.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Partial NSSL laboratory data is available NSSL pedon number 89P0205.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
