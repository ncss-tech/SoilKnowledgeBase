  "OVERVIEW": "The Fairless series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in silty, micaceous loess.  Fairless soils are on loess-mantled hill and mountain backslopes and footslopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 28 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is about 11 inches.",

The weighted average particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral in the solum and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value moist of 3 or 4, and chroma moist from 2 to 5.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value moist from 4 to 6, and chroma moist from 2 to 4.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 6.\nThe C horizon has hue from 10YR to 5Y, value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 4."
