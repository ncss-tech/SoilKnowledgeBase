The weighted average particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral in the solum and slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value moist of 3 or 4, and chroma moist from 2 to 5.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value moist from 4 to 6, and chroma moist from 2 to 4.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 6.\nThe C horizon has hue from 10YR to 5Y, value moist of 4 or 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 4."

Fairbanks soils have fine textured lamellae in the solum. Nunaniq soils are presumed to have warmer soil temperatures. Nanaiq soils lack sandy subsoils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Fairless soils are on backslopes and footslopes of hills and mountains in unglaciated uplands.  The soils formed in micaceous loess that is from 40 inches to many feet thick over fractured bedrock. The climate is cold continental.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 26 to 30 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The length of the growing season is between 93 and 123 days, and the average number of growing degree-days in June, July, and August is 1760."
