    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 to 64 degrees F.  and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is usually dry from mid-May until October or early November and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The organic matter is less than 1 percent between depths of 10 and 20 inches.  Base saturation is 75 to 95 percent in all parts.\nThe A horizon is brown to very dark grayish brown (10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/2, 3/3, 3/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2, 3/2).  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam and is medium or slightly acid.\nThe B2t horizon is brown, yellowish brown, light olive brown, grayish brown, or dark grayish brown (10YR or 2.5Y 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 5/2, 5/3, 4/2).  It is sandy clay, clay or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  This horizon has weak prismatic or blocky structure.  It is medium  or slightly acid.  Most pedons have B3 or B3t horizons that are sandy clay loam or clay loam and commonly have moist value of 5 or 6 in 10YR hue."
