A few limestone fragments may occur in any horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, chroma of 1 or 2.  It is dominantly silty clay loam, but the range includes silty clay.  It is slightly acid or medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 dry, chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay or clay.  It is medium acid to neutral.  Mottles range from few to many and are distinct or prominent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bernard and Mayes series in the same family and the Apperson, Kenoma, Summit, Woodson, and Zaar series.  The Bernard, Mayes, Summit, Woodson, and Zaar soils are more than 60 inches thick over bedrock.  In addition, the Woodson soils have an abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizons, and the Zaar soils lack an argillic horizon.  The Apperson soils are 40 to 60 inches thick over rock.  The Kenoma soils are more than 40 inches thick over bedrock.  GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING:  Fiat soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  They have formed in materials weathered from limestone and shale.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation from 35 to 40 inches.  Thornthwaites Annual P-E index ranges from 58 to 70."

The Apperson and Catoosa soils occur on similar positions as the Fiat soils.  Catoosa soils are fine-silty.  Eram and Shidler soils generally occur on lower topographic positions than Fiat soils.  Eram soils are formed over shale.  Shidler soils are less than 20 inches deep to limestone.  The Kenoma soils usually occur on higher positions."
