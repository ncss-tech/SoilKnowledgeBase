Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent by volume and are commonly well rounded and range in size from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, color value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is dominantly very cobbly and includes stony and very stony modifiers.  Reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hues of 7.5YR through 2.5YR in the upper part and includes 10YR in the lower part, color value of 5 or 6, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 8 with darker colors in upper part.  It is dominantly very gravelly sandy clay, very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay with a range in clay of 35 to 60 percent. Reaction is neutral to medium acid.\nThe C horizon when present has hues of 10YR through 2.5YR.  It is dominantly a coarse sandy clay loam including cobbly loams."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Flatirons soils are on pediments, high terraces, and side slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 5,600 to 6,500 feet.  The soils formed in very gravelly and cobbly loamy stratified old alluvium derived from sedimentary, metamorphic and igneous rocks.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 125 to 142 days."
