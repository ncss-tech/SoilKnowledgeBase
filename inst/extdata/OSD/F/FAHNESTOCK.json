  "OVERVIEW": "The Fahnestock series consists of deep and very deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on continental glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 80 inches and average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The mean winter soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  The difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperatures is 6 to 9 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section has andic soil properties and 35 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  Below a depth of about 40 inches, andic soil properties are absent primarily due to the reduced organic matter and the higher bulk densities.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 through 5 moist and 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly medial sandy loam, very cobbly medial sandy loam, very gravelly medial loam, extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, or extremely gravelly medial loam.  Reaction is moderately acid.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter.\nThe BC horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  Reaction is moderately acid.  Moist bulk density if 0.90 to 1.20 g/cc.  It has less than 1 to 2 percent organic matter."
