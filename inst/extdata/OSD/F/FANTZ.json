  "OVERVIEW": "The Fantz series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from olivine gabbro, gabbro, and metagabbro rock types.  Fantz soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 80 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice. The particle size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 45 to 80 percent rock fragments of which 15 to 45 percent are cobbles. Rock fragments are dominantly olivine gabbro, but include gabbro and metagabbro rock types.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry. It averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 10 percent are cobbles.\nThe C horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 30 to 45 percent gravel and 15 to 45 percent cobbles."

The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 50 to 70 inches.  In the interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon, the mean annnual precipitation may range to 100 inches.  The frost free period is 100 to 200 days."
