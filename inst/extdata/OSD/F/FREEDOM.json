  "OVERVIEW": "The Freedom series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that are formed in alluvium from shale, limestone and sandstone. They are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, lake plains, and stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. The average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F., the average annual precipitation is about 10 inches.",

The soil moisture regime is Aridic bordering on Xeric.\nDepth to the calcic horizon is 7 to 13 inches.  Control section is 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately to very strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist and chroma of 2 or 4. Calcium Carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent in the calcic horizon. Some pedons have discontinuously weakly cemented layers in the Bk horizon."

Genola and Woodrow soils lack calcic horizons. Lisade soils have less than 18 percent clay and Moroni soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Stake soils have a cumulic mollic epipedon and more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Amtoft soils are on strongly sloping to very steep hillsides and ridges. Arapien, Lisade, and Moroni soils are on alluvial plains. Atepic soils are on foothills and mountainsides. Genola, Stake and Woodrow soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans."
