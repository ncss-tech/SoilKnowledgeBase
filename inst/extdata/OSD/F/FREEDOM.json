  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Average annual soil temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is Aridic bordering on Xeric.\nDepth to the calcic horizon is 7 to 13 inches.  Control section is 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately to very strongly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist and chroma of 2 or 4. Calcium Carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent in the calcic horizon. Some pedons have discontinuously weakly cemented layers in the Bk horizon."

Elevations range from 4300 to 6000 feet. They formed in alluvium from shale, limestone,  sandstone and lacustrine sediments. The climate is semiarid, with an average annual precipitation of 8 to 12 inches, and an average annual temperature of 45 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 100 to 150 days."

Amtoft and Atepic soils are 10 to 20 inches deep over limestone and shale respectively. Arapien soils are carbonatic. Denmark soils have a petrocalcic horizon at 10 to 20 inches. Genola and Woodrow soils lack calcic horizons. Lisade soils have less than 18 percent clay and Moroni soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Stake soils have a cumulic mollic epipedon and more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Amtoft soils are on strongly sloping to very steep hillsides and ridges. Arapien, Lisade, and Moroni soils are on alluvial plains. Atepic soils are on foothills and mountainsides. Genola, Stake and Woodrow soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans."
