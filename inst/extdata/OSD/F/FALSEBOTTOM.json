  "OVERVIEW": "The Falsebottom series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in gravelly alluvium derived from mixed igneous and metamorphic rock.  Falsebottom soils are on flood plains and low terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C.",
