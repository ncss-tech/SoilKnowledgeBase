  "OVERVIEW": "The Flycatcher series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from serpentinized peridotite or serpentinized metaigneous rock types.  Flycatcher soils are on broad ridgetops and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 145 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
