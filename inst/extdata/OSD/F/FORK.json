Depth to bedrock is more than 72 inches.  0 to 10 percent of rounded gravel of quartz are present in the A, E, BA, BE, Btg, and BCg horizons and 0 to 20 percent in the Cg horizon. Unless limed the soils are very strongly acid through moderately acid in the A and E horizons, very strongly acid through neutral in the BA, BE, Bt, Btg, and BCg horizons, and moderately acid or neutral in the Cg horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons are mottled with higher chroma in the lower part.  The E horizon is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BA or BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.
