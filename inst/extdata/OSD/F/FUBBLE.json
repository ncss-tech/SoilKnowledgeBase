Banbury soils do not have a horizon with secondary carbonates below the argillic horizon and may have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Bombadil and Stumount soils have bedrock at depth of 18 to 36 cm and do not have a horizon with secondary carbonates below the argillic horizon.  Dougal soils have bedrock at 18 to 40 cm, do not have a horizon with secondary carbonates below the argillic horizon, and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Jaybee soils have 35 to 45 percent clay in some part of the argillic horizon. Kresa soils have bedrock at 10 to 25 cm, do not have a horizon with secondary carbonates below the argillic horizon, and have 15 to 30 percent soft, platy fragments of schist. Meninik soils do not have a horizon with secondary carbonates below the argillic horizon."

The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
