  "OVERVIEW": "The Flybow series consists of very shallow, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in material weathered from basalt and greenstone. Flybow soils have slopes that range from 4 to 100 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Slopes range from 4 to 100 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt and greenstone. The elevation ranges from 800 to 6,210 feet. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 26 inches. Average annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 170 days."
