    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 4 to 100 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt and greenstone. The elevation ranges from 800 to 6,210 feet. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 26 inches. Average annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 170 days."
