  "OVERVIEW": "The Firstgap series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium over residuum derived from shale and siltstone.  Firstgap soils are on hills and structural benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
