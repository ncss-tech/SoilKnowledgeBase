These soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from mixed rocks.  Elevation is 95 to 175 feet, (29 to 53 m).  Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 23 inches, (457 to 584 cm).  The mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F, 16 to 17 degrees C).  Frost free season is 240 to 250 days."

Parrott soils are fine-silty, and are on flood plains between the meander belt and distal alluvial fans and occur closer to the Sacramento River.  Gianella soils are coarse-loamy, and occur within the meander belt on flood plains.  Conejo soils are fine-loamy, and are on alluvial fans.  Bussaca soils are fine, and are on distal fans.  Bosquejo soils are fine, and are in interfan basins."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - zone from 0 to 5 inches, (0 to 13 cm) (Ap)\nCambic Horizon - zone from 5 to 33 inches, (13 to 84 cm) (ABt, Bt1, Bt2, Bt3)\nDiscontinuity - zone from 33 to 57 inches, (84 to 145 cm) (2Btb1, 2Btb2 horizons buried fan deposits).\nThe soil moisture control section zone from 6 to 16 inches, (15 to 41 cm)\nThe particle-size control section 10 to 40 inches, (25 to 102 cm))\nThere is a clay increase in the modal profile from 28 percent in the Bt3 horizon to 35 percent at the buried layer (2Btb1).  The increase in organic carbon and the decrease in chroma at 33 inches indicate this is an old surface of a buried soil, rather than an argillic horizon.  The field notes indicate that some of the buried soils have clay films.\nThese soils are in areas that have been extensively leveled for agriculture. Drainages and channels have been filled, moved, or altered in some other fashion.  It is possible that some of the field work on these soils was completed in these highly modified areas.\nPart of the flood plain sequence represented by Farwell in Tehama Co. and Codora (Zamora) in Glenn Co.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data from lab pedon number: 89P0068, NSSL, Lincoln, NE.
