The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 61 to 64 degrees F.  The soil is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 50 to 75 consecutive days or more within the 4 months following the summer solstice.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.  It is cobbly clay loam or sandy loam and has 0 to 40 percent rock fragments.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C1 and C2 horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  They are clay loam or clay and average 38 to 50 percent clay.  These horizons are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and 10 to 17 inches thick.  Mottles with 2.5Y hue occur in some pedons and range from none to common."
