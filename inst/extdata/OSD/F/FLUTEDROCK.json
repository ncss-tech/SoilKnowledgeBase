  "OVERVIEW": "The Flutedrock series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability. Flutedrock soils formed in material weathered from sandstone and eolian material. Flutedrock soils are on summits and shoulders of plateaus with bedrock controlled landscapes. Slopes are 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
