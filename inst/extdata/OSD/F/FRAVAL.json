  "BYREV": "Rev. WED-JVC",
  "REVDATE": "03/2017",
  "STATES": "CA,NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fraval series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff and altered andesite.  Fraval soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Brassey, Henhoit, Little Wood, and Morningstar soils are very deep.  Durst and Sapkin soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Fergie and Sattley soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Mulshoe soils are dominated by stones in the particle-size control section and have paralithic materials that are weathered basalt in the series control section."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff and altered andesite.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,707 to 2,591 meters.  The climate is dry-subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 760 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., the mean January temperature is about 0 degrees C., and the mean July temperature is about 18 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

The vegetation is principally a forest canopy of Jeffrey pine with an understory of snowberry, manzanita, pinemat manzanita, and grasses.  Mountain big sagebrush, antelope bitterbrush, and curlleaf mountainmahogany dominate in burned-over or harvested areas, especially on south-facing slopes."
