The base elevation range was extended to 30 meters (100 feet). The intent is to restrict Fuquay soils to areas above the toe of the Surry scarp.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 86 centimeters (Ap and E horizons)\nKandic horizon--the zone between 86 to 244 centimeters has low activity clay in more than 50 percent of the upper 100 centimeters of the horizon (Bt, Bt, and Btv horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 86 to 244 centimeters (Bt, Bt, and Btv horizons)\nPlinthite--more than 5 percent plinthite nodules in the zone from 127 to 244 centimeters (Btv horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: Characterization/Reference data are available from NRCS-Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.; User Pedon ID (S06GA251001) or Lab Pedon Number (06NO934) is representative of the Fuquay Series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
