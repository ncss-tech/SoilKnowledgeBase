  "OVERVIEW": "The Fishcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on outwash plains, eskers and kames. They formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits derived from sedimentary parent material. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum. Slope ranges from 3 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1476 mm and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Rock fragments, mostly gravels and cobbles, typically range from 0 to 30 percent in the mineral solum and from 0 to 70 percent in the substratum, but the weighted average in the particle size control section is less than 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from ultra acid to extremely acid in the O horizons and extremely to strongly acid in the subsoil and substratum.\nMost pedons have an O horizon composed of highly, moderately or slightly decomposed plant materials. They have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value 2 to 3, chroma 1 or 2. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 4. The texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of  5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bh/Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or less. The Bs horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, with value or chroma of 4 or more. Textures for the Bh/Bhs and Bs horizons range from loam to loamy sand. With gravelly and cobbly analogs allowed only in the lower Bs horizons.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.
