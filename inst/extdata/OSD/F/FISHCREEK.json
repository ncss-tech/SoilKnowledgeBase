  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Bedrock is at a depth greater than 152 cm. Thickness of the mineral solum ranges from 40 to 140 cm. Rock fragments, mostly gravels and cobbles, typically range from 0 to 30 percent in the mineral solum and from 0 to 70 percent in the substratum, but the weighted average in the particle size control section is less than 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from ultra acid to extremely acid in the O horizons and extremely to strongly acid in the subsoil and substratum.\nMost pedons have an O horizon composed of highly, moderately or slightly decomposed plant materials. They have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value 2 to 3, chroma 1 or 2. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 4. The texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of  5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bh/Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or less. The Bs horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, with value or chroma of 4 or more. Textures for the Bh/Bhs and Bs horizons range from loam to loamy sand. With gravelly and cobbly analogs allowed only in the lower Bs horizons.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Textures range from fine sandy loam to sand with or without gravelly and cobbly analogs.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Textures range from very fine sand to coarse sand with or without gravelly and cobbly analogs."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fishcreek (T) soils are on terraces, eskers, kames, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 3 to 35 percent. These soils are formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits. The deposits are derived primarily from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1270 to 1727 mm, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 1 to 11 degrees C. The frost free season ranges from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 305 to 610 meters above sea level."

Highmarket (T) soils are Coarse-loamy in the upper solum and Sandy or Sandy-skeletal in the substratum and are derived from glacial till. Both Worth and Empeyville soils are derived from glacial till and have fragipans."
