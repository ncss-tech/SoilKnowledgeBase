    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Floke soils are on tablelands at elevations of 1,525 to 1,830 meters.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in residuum derived from volcanic tuff and basalt.  The climate is characterized by cold moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
