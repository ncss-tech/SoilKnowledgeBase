  "OVERVIEW": "The Floke series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and alluvium derived from basalt and tuff.  Floke soils are on tablelands with slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the annual temperature is 7 degrees C.",
