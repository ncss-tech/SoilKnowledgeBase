The weighted average of pebbles in the particle-size control section is more than 35 percent, by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles and cobbles ranges from 15 to 60 percent by volume.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Masses of iron accumulations in shades of brown range from none to common.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles, cobbles, and flagstones ranges from 35 to more than 60 percent by volume.\nThe Cr horizon consists of weathered igneous bedrock.\nThe R horizon consists of unweathered igneous bedrock."

All of these soils are on similar positions as Fredriksdal soils.  Annaberg soils are loamy-skeletal.  Cramer and Susannaberg soils have clayey particle-size control sections.  In addition, Susannaberg soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Dorothea soils are very deep and do not have a Mollic epipedon.  Maho Bay soils are loamy.  Victory soils are moderately deep and are loamy-skeletal."
