Cracks 1 mm. wide or larger extend to a depth of 24 inches or more. Cracks remain open for more than 60 consecutive days in late summer in most years and remain closed during the winter. Depth to segregated lime ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 49 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 61 degrees F.\nAp horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and dry value of 3 or 4. It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam and has 30 to 60 percent clay.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.
