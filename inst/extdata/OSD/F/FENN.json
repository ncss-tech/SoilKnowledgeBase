    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 40 inches and usually more than 60 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 18 to 32 inches. Cracks 1 mm. wide or larger extend to a depth of 24 inches or more. Cracks remain open for more than 60 consecutive days in late summer in most years and remain closed during the winter. Depth to segregated lime ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 49 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 61 degrees F.\nAp horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and dry value of 3 or 4. It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam and has 30 to 60 percent clay.\nThe B2 horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silty clay or clay and has less than 60 percent clay."

Cardon soils are generally saturated within 30 inches of the surface, mottled below a depth of 20 inches, and strongly calcareous. Pit soils have thick dark gray A horizons, are somewhat poorly and poorly drained and have mottles below a depth of 40 inches."
