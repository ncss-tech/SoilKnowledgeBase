    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Baboquivari (AZ), Canez (NM), Courtland (AZ), Triomas (TX) and Walkon (NM) series. Baboquivari soils have 1 to 3 percent organic matter in the surface and are noneffervescent throughout. Canez soils have buried soil horizons above 150 centimeters (60 inches) and receive one half or more of the precipitation during May and early September. Courtland soils have surface horizons that are 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches) thick and color hues of 2.5YR or 5YR throughout the argillic. Triomas soils formed in eolian materials, have fine sand and loamy fine sand surface textures and lack rock fragments. Walkon soils have a lithic contact at 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fairlan soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from igneous and metamorphic sources. Elevations are 1340 to 1510 meters (4395 to 4953 feet). The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to the Sonoran Desert.  The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 225 millimeters (7 to 9 inches). The mean annual air temperature is 13 to 17 degrees C (55 to 63 degrees F). The frost-free season is 210 to 270 days."
