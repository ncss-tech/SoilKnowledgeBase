    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry during the summer for 80 to 110 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 52 to 56 degrees F.  Subrounded rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent in the control section.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. The solum is 40 to over 60 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon when present, has the same range in hue, value and chroma as the Bt horizon.  Faint to distinct redox concentrations are below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons."

Colma soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 55 to 58 degrees F, have a solum less than 40 inches thick and have mottles in the subsoil.  Dragoon, Duzel, Morical and Tweedy soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Facy soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches, are on uplands and have 0 to 35 percent (2 to 5 mm) gravel throughout the particle-size control section.  Farrot, Immiant, Lobitos, Los Gatos and Mehlhorn soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Taneum soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 50 degrees F and are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days.  Ladd soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F.  Teiton soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 52 degrees F.  Yaxon soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 49 to 52 degrees F and are neutral to mildly alkaline throughout the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Foehlin soils are on alluvial fans and low stream terraces at elevation of 200 to 2,500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. The soils formed in moderately fine textured alluvium weathered from metamorphic, granitic, and ultramafic rocks.  The climate is characterized by having hot and dry summers and warm and wet winters.   The mean annual precipitation is typically 25 to 60 inches.  In the interior river valleys of Curry County, Oregon, the mean annual precipitation may range to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 235 days."

Brockman soils are moderately well drained and are fine textured and serpentinitic.  Clawson soils are somewhat poorly drained and are coarse-loamy.  Copsey soils are poorly drained and fine textured and serpentinitic.  Kerby soils have an ochric epipedon and lack an argillic horizon.  Takilma soils are loamy-skeletal."
