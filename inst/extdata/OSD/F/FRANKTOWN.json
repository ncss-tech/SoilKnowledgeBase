  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Franktown soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  Elevations range from 5,200 to 8,000 feet.  Slopes are 45 to 80 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from metamorphic rocks such as gneiss, schist, slate, or metavolcanics.  The climate is subhumid-continental with a mean annual precipitation of 16 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F., the mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
