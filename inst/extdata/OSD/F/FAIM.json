Bischoff soils include hues redder than 7.5YR and formed in loess and silty alluvium.  Burnette, Fulcher, Grouseville (T), Mayflower and Paulson soils have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Guero soils have clay contents in the BC & C horizons of 35 to 50 percent and have 5YR hues in the Bt and C horizon.  Fulcher and Skutum soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Cochetopa soils contain dark colored magnetic mineral grains in the fine sand and silt fractions.  Lintim soils are formed in shale and have horizon fragments from shale lithology.  Mayflower soils are underlain by interbedded sandstone and shale at depths of 20 to 40 inches (51 to 102 cm).  Leemorris, Mancos, Runlett and Winridge soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Richens soils have an E horizon.  Paulson and Perinos soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Faim soils are at elevations of 7,750 to 10,400 feet (2,362 to 3,170 m).  They occur on mountain slopes, valleys and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium, slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The climate is humid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 40 inches (559 to 1016 mm).  The mean annual air temperature is 33 to 40 degrees F (.6 to 4.4 degrees C).  The mean summer temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F (11.1 to 12.8 degrees C), and the freeze-free period ranges from 40 to 80 days."
