    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ford soils are on smooth to undulating low lake terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from limestone, quartzite, and gneiss.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 4,300 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid with a mean annual precipitation of 14 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 68 to 73 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 175 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches (A horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 9 to 34 inches and 44 to 52 inches (Bk1, Bk2, and B'k horizons).\nPetrocalcic horizon - The zones from 34 to 44 inches and from 52 to 60 inches (Bkm and B'km horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 48 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bk2, Bkm, and B'k horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 34 inches (Bk2 horizon and part of the Bk1 horizon).\nThis revision of February 2006 updates the taxonomic class from Coarse-loam, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Palexerolls based on the lack of redoximorphic features in the profile above the upper petrocalcic horizon.  The cation exchange activity class is estimated.\nThis series has not been studied in the field since 1965.  Additional field work is needed to accurately determine the range of depths for the water table.  The previous range of the water table was listed as 0 to 60 inches.  The current range is based on the type location map unit in the Davis-Weber Area Soil Survey.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 138-139, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
