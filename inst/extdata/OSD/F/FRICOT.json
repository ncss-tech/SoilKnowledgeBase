  "OVERVIEW": "The Fricot series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from phyllite, schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. The Fricot soils are on hills and ridges. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 930 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
