    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches and includes part or all of the argillic horizon. The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 5 to 20 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section average 35 to 45 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in the A horizon. Solum thickness and depth to lithic contact with basalt or tuff ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry. It is ashy silt loam or ashy loam with 15 to 27 percent clay. It has 0 to 3 percent stones, 0 to 3 percent cobbles, and 5 to 20 percent gravel. In some pedons, the amount of sandsized pumice varies from 5 to 15 percent.\nThe 2BAt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. It is clay loam with 27 to 40 percent clay. It has 5 to 30 percent cobbles and 10 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist, 3 through 6 dry. It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay. It has 20 to 60 percent cobbles and 15 to 40 percent gravel. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2BC horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2.5 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is loam or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 15 to 25 percent gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Finsel soils are on north-facing hillslopes and have slopes of 12 to 70 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from basalt and tuff mixed with loess and volcanic ash in the surface. Elevations are 3,400 to 5,400 feet. These soils can be characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. Mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F. Mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."

Camool soils are north-facing hillslopes with Finsel soils and are 12 to 20 inches to a lithic contact. Hutchley soils are shallow, loamy-skeletal, and are found on east facing slopes of north-south trending canyons. Kishwalk and Waterbury soils mesic and are found on south facing slopes. Kishwalk soils moderately deep to bedrock whereas Waterbury soils are shallow to bedrock."
