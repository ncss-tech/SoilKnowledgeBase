  "REVDATE": "10/2007",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fourmilebench series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that developed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone and mudstone deposits. Fourmilebench soils occur on structural benches and dipslopes of cuestas. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
