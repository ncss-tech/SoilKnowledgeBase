  "OVERVIEW": "The Fairmount series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in limestone residuum interbedded with this layers of calcareous shales.  These soils are on hillsides and narrow ridges with slopes ranging from 2 to 60 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 46 inches.  Average annual temperature is 56 degrees F.",

This flat limestone fragments from 1 to 15 inches long range from 5 to 35 percent.  Some pedons have a few small brown or black concretions.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It has moderate or strong, very fine to medium, angular blocky, subangular blocky, or granular structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5 Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It has moderate or strong, medium to very fine angular blocky or subangular blocky structure, and is firm or very firm.  Some pedons have few to common mottles in shades of brown, gray, or olive, and some lack darker ped coatings."

Corydon soils have argillic horizons.  Cynthiana soils lack mollic epipedons, and have argillic horizons.\nGEOGRAPHIC setting:  Fairmount soils are on hillsides and narrow ridge with slopes ranging from 2 to 60 percent.  The soil formed in residuum from limestone with this interbedded layers of calcareous shales.  Rock outcrops and rock escarpments are common, particularly on steep slopes.  Some ridge areas and upper side slopes have karst topography.  The average precipitation ranges from 44 to 48 inches, and the average annual temperature from 50 to 57 degrees F."

Lowell soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock.  McAfee soils have argillic horizons with redder hue and lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."
