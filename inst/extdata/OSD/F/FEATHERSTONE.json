    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Featherstone soils are on level to nearly level floodplains in the Coastal Plain.  They do not flood daily but are subject to high seasonal tides and storm tides.  The water table is commonly at the surface and most areas are subject to ponding.  These soils are commonly at sea level or up to two feet above sea level.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 44 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 57 to 60 degrees F."
