  "OVERVIEW": "The Fan Lake series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits or Latah formation with a thin mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Fan Lake soils are on relict glacial lake terraces, outwash terraces and convex toeslopes of foothills. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
