Henneway soils are 40 to 60 inches to a lithic contact. Neva soils lack fragic properties and redox concentrations or depletions, are dry for 45 to 75 consecutive days, and are considered well drained. Tahand soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact. A Similar soil with mixed mineralogy is the Witcher series. Witcher soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact and are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days."

These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits or Latah formation with a thin mantle of volcanic ash and loess. Fan Lake soils are in a continental climate having warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
