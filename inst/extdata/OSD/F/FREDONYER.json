  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fredonyer soils are on mountains and plateaus.  They typically occur on all slope positions.  These soils formed in surface mantles of volcanic ash over residuum and colluvium derived from basalt or andesite.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 5,000 to 7,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches including about 20 to 40 inches of snow.  The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."

Oxalate aluminum plus one half extractable iron and volcanic glass content in the A horizons is estimated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 28 inches (A1, A2, Bw1, and Bw2 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 28 inches to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 28 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons and part of the A2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
