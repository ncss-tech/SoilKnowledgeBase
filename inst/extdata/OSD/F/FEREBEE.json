    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 7 to 14 inches.  Thickness of the A horizons range from 1 to 10 inches.  The umbric epipedon is not continuous within each pedon.  Base saturation of the surface horizon is assumed to be less that 50 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 34 degrees F.  Content of coarse fragments for all pedons range from 35 to 70 percent.  Clay content throughout the profile is less than 5 percent.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from extremely acid to medium acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value moist of 2 or 3, and chroma moist of 3 or less.  Texture is silt loam or fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 15 to 60 percent with 0 to 30 percent cobble and 15 to 50 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value moist from 2 to 4, and chroma moist of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 70 percent with 5 to 40 percent cobble and 30 to 65 percent gravel."
