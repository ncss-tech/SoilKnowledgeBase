    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, the depths in the following paragraph are measured from the mineral soil surface.)  Thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the upper solum and from 25 to 60 percent in the lower solum and substratum.  The particle-size control section averages from 35 to 65 percent coarse fragments.  Throughout the pedon the cobble content ranges from 0 to 15 percent, and stones range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 2.5, and has a chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.  Reaction is very strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.  Reaction is very strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bs1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4.  It is gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bs2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4.  It is gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly coarse sand or sand.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Farquar soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  These soils formed in gravelly and sandy outwash.  Elevations range from 1,000 to 1,700 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 32 to 36 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period is about 100 to 130 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pelissier, Chabeneau (T), Croswell, Channinng, and Minocqua soils.  The excessively drained Pelissier soils are in the same drainage sequence and are on adjacent higher landscape positions.  Chabeneau soils have a thicker loamy mantle, contain fewer coarse fragments in the upper profile, and are on similar landscape positions.  Croswell soils have sandy textures throughout the entire profile, contain less than 15 percent gravel throughout the profile, and are also on similar landscape positions.  The somewhat poorly drained Channing and the poorly drained Minocqua soils have a thicker loamy mantle, contain fewer coarse fragments in the upper profile, and are common associates in depressions and drainageways."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Runoff is slow and the permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy and gravelly outwash.  An apparent water table is at a depth of 2 to 3.5 feet from October to June."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Farquar soils are mixed coniferous and deciduous forests.  Quaking aspen, red maple, balsam poplar, and pin cherry are common deciduous trees.  Jack pine, red pine, white spruce, balsam fir, and northern white cedar are common coniferous trees.  In some areas jack pine is the dominant forest cover.  Common ground plants are bracken fern, wintergreen, canada blueberry, wild lily of the valley, wild sarsaparilla, bunchberry, and bigleaf aster."
