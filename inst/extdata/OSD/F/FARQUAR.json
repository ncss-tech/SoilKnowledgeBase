  "OVERVIEW": "The Farquar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy and gravelly outwash on stream terraces and outwash plains.   Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy and gravelly outwash.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Elevations range from 1,000 to 1,700 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 32 to 36 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F.  The frost free period is about 100 to 130 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Pelissier, Chabeneau (T), Croswell, Channinng, and Minocqua soils.  The excessively drained Pelissier soils are in the same drainage sequence and are on adjacent higher landscape positions.  Chabeneau soils have a thicker loamy mantle, contain fewer coarse fragments in the upper profile, and are on similar landscape positions.  Croswell soils have sandy textures throughout the entire profile, contain less than 15 percent gravel throughout the profile, and are also on similar landscape positions.  The somewhat poorly drained Channing and the poorly drained Minocqua soils have a thicker loamy mantle, contain fewer coarse fragments in the upper profile, and are common associates in depressions and drainageways."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",

Jack pine, red pine, white spruce, balsam fir, and northern white cedar are common coniferous trees.  In some areas jack pine is the dominant forest cover.  Common ground plants are bracken fern, wintergreen, canada blueberry, wild lily of the valley, wild sarsaparilla, bunchberry, and bigleaf aster."
