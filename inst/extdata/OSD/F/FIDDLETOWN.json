  "OVERVIEW": "The Fiddletown series consists of moderately deep to deep, well drained soils formed in material derived from metasedimentary schists and slates. These soils occur on high hills and mountain slopes under mixed conifers and hardwoods. The mean annual precipitation is about 920 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
