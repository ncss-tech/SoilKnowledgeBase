  "OVERVIEW": "The Fontreen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from limestone, sandstone, chert, and shale. Fontreen soils are on alluvial fans, hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",

Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. They formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from limestone, sandstone, chert and shale. The climate is dry subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 400 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 2 to 7 degrees C. Freeze-free period is commonly 70 to 110 days, but higher elevations have shorter freeze-free periods."
