  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fontreen soils are on moderately sloping to steep alluvial fans and fan remnants and on steep to very steep hillslopes and mountain slopes at elevations of 1,585 to 2,500 meters. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. They formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and residuum derived from limestone, sandstone, chert and shale. The climate is dry subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 400 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 2 to 7 degrees C. Freeze-free period is commonly 70 to 110 days, but higher elevations have shorter freeze-free periods."

Mower soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section. Sanpete and Wales soils lack mollic epipedons."
