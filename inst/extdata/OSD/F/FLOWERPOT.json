  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to a depth 30 inches (A1, A2, AB, and Bw horizons)\nParticle-size control section - from a depth of 10 to 40 inches (part of the A2, AB, Bw, and part of the Bg horizons)\nAndic subgroup features - from a depth of 1 to 14 inches (A1 and A2 horizons) not meeting andic soil properties based on a moist bulk density of more than 0.9 g/cm3.\nAquic feature - from a depth of 11 to 60 inches having aquic conditions and associated redox depletions.\nA proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties. If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
