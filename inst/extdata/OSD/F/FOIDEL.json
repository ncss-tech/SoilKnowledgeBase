  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Foidel series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes, hills, and plateaus.  They formed in loess and alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Slopes range from 3 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
