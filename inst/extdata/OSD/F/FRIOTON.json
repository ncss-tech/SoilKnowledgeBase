  "REVDATE": "02/2003",
  "STATES": "OK,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Frioton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils.  They formed in loamy and clayey sediments of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are on smooth flood plains and formed under trees with an understory of native grasses.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to more than 50 inches.  Texture throughout the soil is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or their gravelly counterparts.\nThe A horizon is black (10YR 2/1), very dark brown (10YR 2/2), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), or dark brown (10YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2).  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons are noncalcareous in the upper\n10 inches of the A11 horizon.  The clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  The control section of some pedons contains 5 to 15 percent by volume of fragments of limestone or chert.  Below a depth of 24 inches, some pedons have B horizons that have higher value or chroma than the A horizons.\nThe C horizon is very dark gray (10YR 3/1), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark brown (10YR 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2), dark gray (10YR 4/1), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), brown (10YR 4/3, 5/3; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2), or gray (10YR 5/1).  Some pedons have thin strata of more loamy or clayey sediments in the C horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Egan series and the closely competing Buxin, Catalpa, Moreland, Pledger, and Ringo series.  Buxin, Moreland, and Pledger soils have vertic properties.  Catalpa and Ringo soils have mollic epipedons less than 24 inches thick.  In addition, Ringo soils are underlain by shale at depths ranging from 20 to 40 inches.  Egan soils lack carbonates within the profile."

They are flooded for very brief periods during the months of February through July.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 degrees to 70 degrees F.; average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches; Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 64 to 80.  Frost free days range from 210 to 240.  Elevation ranges from 400 to 800 feet."
