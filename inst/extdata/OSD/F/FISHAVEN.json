  "OVERVIEW": "The Fishaven series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium and residuum dominantly from limestone.  They are on hills.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 8 to 20 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
