These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Elevation is 3 to 50 meters (5 to 160 feet). The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2286 millimeters (35 to 90 inches). The mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F). The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F). The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 56 degrees F). The frost free season is about 275 to 330 days."
