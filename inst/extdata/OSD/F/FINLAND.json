  "OVERVIEW": "The Finland series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in a friable loamy mantle and underlying firm loamy glacial till on moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the upper layers and moderately slow to slow in the dense till.  Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 29 inches.",

Ahmeek soils have an ochric epipedon and less coarse fragments throughout.  Burton and Mesaba soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.  Newfound soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR in the lower B and C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on mid and upper convex side slopes of the bedrock-cored Highland Moraine and nearby terminal, recessional and ground moraines.  Slope gradients typically are 1 to 18 percent, but range to 35 percent.  The dense till is Superior Lobe of Late Wisconsinan Age.  The mantle has more silt and very fine sand and is probably of more recent age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 35 to 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipition ranges from about 28 to 30 inches.  These soils are within the lake influenced climate of Lake Superior."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The Hermantown soils form a drainage sequence with the Finland soils.  They are somewhat poorly drained and are on lower lying plane to slightly concave slopes.  The Ahmeek soils form a climesequence with the Finland soils and are geographically west and southwest.  Ahmeek soils are also beyond the local modified climate of Lake Superior."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Taxonomy dictates that an Umbric epipedon be at least 1 color value darker than the 2Bw horizon, but this is waived because of dark parent material and the organic matter content meets requirements.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized are:  umbric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (A and Bhs horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 39 inches (Bs and 2Bw horizons).\nThis soil with slope of 1 to 8 percent is prime farmland.\nAdditional Data:  Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 3391 for some analysis of the typical pedon."
