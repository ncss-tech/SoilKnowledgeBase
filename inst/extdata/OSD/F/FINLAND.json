    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burton series in this family and the closely related Ahmeek, Mesaba, and Newfound series.  Ahmeek soils have an ochric epipedon and less coarse fragments throughout.  Burton and Mesaba soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.  Newfound soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR in the lower B and C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on mid and upper convex side slopes of the bedrock-cored Highland Moraine and nearby terminal, recessional and ground moraines.  Slope gradients typically are 1 to 18 percent, but range to 35 percent.  The dense till is Superior Lobe of Late Wisconsinan Age.  The mantle has more silt and very fine sand and is probably of more recent age.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 35 to 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipition ranges from about 28 to 30 inches.  These soils are within the lake influenced climate of Lake Superior."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The Hermantown soils form a drainage sequence with the Finland soils.  They are somewhat poorly drained and are on lower lying plane to slightly concave slopes.  The Ahmeek soils form a climesequence with the Finland soils and are geographically west and southwest.  Ahmeek soils are also beyond the local modified climate of Lake Superior."
