  "OVERVIEW": "The Feeder series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and loess influenced alluvium. Feeder soils have slopes of 0 to 40 percent and are on hillslopes, fan remnants, and valley floors. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
