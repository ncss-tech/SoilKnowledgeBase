    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Foleylake soils are on lava plateaus. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in loess derived from mixed rocks over residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt or unweathered tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,435 to 1,895 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
