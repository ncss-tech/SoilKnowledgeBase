  "OVERVIEW": "The Feterita series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium overlying silty or loamy alluvium. These soils are on basin floors of enclosed depressions on tablelands and terraces in the Central High Tablelands (MLRA 72). Mean annual precipitation is 18 inches (46 centimeters), and mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F (13 degrees C.).",

The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F (12 to 14 degrees C.), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 20 inches (43 to 51 centimeters).
