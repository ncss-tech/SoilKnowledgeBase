    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Feterita soils are on basin floors of enclosed depressions on tableland and terraces, which vary from a few inches to 10 feet (3 meters) below the surrounding areas. Slopes are plane or concave, and gradients are less than 1 percent. The soils formed in clayey alluvium overlying more silty or loamy calcareous alluvium. The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F (12 to 14 degrees C.), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 20 inches (43 to 51 centimeters). Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index ranges from 28 to 40."

Native vegetation fluctuates from western wheatgrass, buffalograss, and associated species to wetland vegetation, such as smartweed, ragweed, barnyardgrass, and sedges, following periods of extended inundation."
