  "OVERVIEW": "The Fingerridge series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum derived from glassy tuff or tuff-breccia. Fingerridge soils are on mountains. Slopes are 2to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
