  "STATES": "IA,MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Floris series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in stratified silty and loamy alluvium. The Floris soils are on narrow to moderately wide flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 34 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the A or Ap horizon ranges from 4 to 9 inches. The depth to the loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam material ranges from 20 to 36 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at 50 centimeters is 49 to 56 degrees F. The average summer soil temperature is about 74 degrees F and the average winter soil temperature is about 34 degrees F. The difference between average summer and winter soil temperatures is about 38 to 42 degrees F. The soil typically is neutral or slightly acid to a depth of 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe C horizon is stratified and has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, and 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. The texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam with bands of loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kickapoo, Pillery, and Russ soils in the same family and the similar Belfast, Culvard, Klum, Nodaway and  Wirt series. Belfast soils formed in a cooler, much wetter climate. Colvard soils are well drained, formed in alluvium from the Appalachian Mountains, and commonly are underlain with cobbly or gravelly material. Kickapoo soils have an Ab horizon at a depth between 20 and 40 inches. Pillery soils have a 2C horizon that is gravelly or very gravelly loamy sand or sand, 25 to 40 percent pebbles, and 0 to 10 percent cobbles at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Russ soils have a difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature of less than 16 degrees F. Wirt soils are well drained, have subsoil structure, and commonly have a sandy or gravelly substratum. Klum soils have a darker colored surface layer and contain more sand in the lower C horizon. Nodaway soils are fine-silty."

Klum, Ackmore, Amana, Nodaway, and Perks soils are on similar landscape positions. Ackmore, Amana, Chequest, Coppock, Nodaway, Vesser, and Zook soils contain less sand than Floris soils. Chequest and Zook soils are poorly drained and are on somewhat lower landscape positions that are farther away from the stream channel than Floris soils. Coppock and Vesser soils are on slightly higher bottom land landscape positions than Floris soils. In addition, Amana, Chequest, Vesser, and Zook soils have mollic epipedons."
