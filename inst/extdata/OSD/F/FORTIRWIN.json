Arizo soils are on alluvial fans and inset fans, have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section and do not have a duripan or an argillic horizon. Crackerjack, Crosgrain, Fourcorners, Goldivide, and Tenwell soils are on similar landscape positions. Crackerjack soils have a loamy particle-size control section, are shallow to a cambidic duripan and do not have an argillic horizon. Crosgrain and Fourcorners soils are both shallow or very shallow to a duripan and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections. In addition, Crosgrain does not have an argillic horizon. Goldivide soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and do not have a duripan. Tenwell soils are moderately deep to a duripan and have fine-loamy particle- size control sections."
