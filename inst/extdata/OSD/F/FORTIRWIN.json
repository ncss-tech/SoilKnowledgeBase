  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fortirwin soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. The soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevations are 1,600 to 4,200 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation occurs in winter but a significant portion is received between July and September following convection storms. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches; mean annual air temperature is 61 to 70 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."

Arizo soils are on alluvial fans and inset fans, have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section and do not have a duripan or an argillic horizon. Crackerjack, Crosgrain, Fourcorners, Goldivide, and Tenwell soils are on similar landscape positions. Crackerjack soils have a loamy particle-size control section, are shallow to a cambidic duripan and do not have an argillic horizon. Crosgrain and Fourcorners soils are both shallow or very shallow to a duripan and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections. In addition, Crosgrain does not have an argillic horizon. Goldivide soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and do not have a duripan. Tenwell soils are moderately deep to a duripan and have fine-loamy particle- size control sections."
