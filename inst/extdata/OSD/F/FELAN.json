  "OVERVIEW": "The Felan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium derived from limestone or argillite.  Felan soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
