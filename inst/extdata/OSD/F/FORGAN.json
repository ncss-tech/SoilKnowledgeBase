  "OVERVIEW": "The Forgan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy eolian deposits of Holocene age. These nearly level soils occur on plains and interdunes of sand sheets of the Southern High Plains, Northern part (MLRA 77A). Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm (l8 in).",
