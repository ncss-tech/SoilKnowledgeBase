It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe E and E' horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.

It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe upper Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Redox features in shades of red, yellow, and brown are present in some pedons and gray iron depletions are within 30 inches of the surface. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with less than 20 percent silt. Some pedons have a thin subhorizon that is sandy clay loam. Many pedons contain lenses and pockets of clean sand. Some pedons have a few nodules of plinthite.\nThe B't horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8. It has few to many redox features in shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray or it is mottled. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8 or it is mottled without a dominant matrix color. It is fine sand, sand, loamy fine sandy, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay and in some pedons it is stratified with these textures."

Dallardsville soils have tongues of albic material in the B horizon. Harleston soils contain more than 20 percent silt in the particle-size control section. Dragston are aquults. Johns and Whitwell soils are fine loamy. Nansemond soils do not have secondary Bt horizons within 60 inches. Olanta, Rumford, and Sequatchie soils do not have mottles of chroma 2 or less within 24 inches of the top of the argillic horizon. Pactolus soils are sandy throughout."

The Autryville, Bonneau, Chisolm, Dothan, Fuquay, Norfolk, and Wagram soils are in slightly higher positions on the landscape and are better drained. In addition, these soils, except for Dothan and Norfolk, are arenic. They all have fine-loamy Bt horizons. The Goldsboro soils are in a similar position on the landscape, but they are fine-loamy. Lynchburg, Ocilla, Paxville and Rains soils are in slightly lower positions on the landscape and are more poorly drained and have fine-loamy Bt horizons. Leon, Lynn Haven and Rutlege soils are in the lowest position on the landscape, are more poorly drained, and are sandy throughout."
