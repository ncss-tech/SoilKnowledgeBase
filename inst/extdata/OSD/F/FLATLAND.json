  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the fly ash materials is generally more than 5 feet thick. Hues are N/ , 10Y, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4. Textures include silt loam, loam and sandy loam. Coarse fragments of coal, slag, brick, glass and metals range from 0 to 30 percent. Depletions, where present, occurs between 38 and 60 cm. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe ^Au horizon may be defined more on the abundance of roots than anything else. The structure is very fine granular or it is structureless. Organic carbon accumulation would be difficult to identify by morphology.\nThe ^Cu horizons have distinctly fewer roots than the ^Au horizon, but otherwise look similar. It is structureless. Redoximorphic concentrations are common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Flatland soils are on nearly level to steep artificially created landforms in fill areas. These soils formed in fly ash that resulted from industrial burning of coal. Some areas may be covered with a thin cap of natural soil as a prevention of wind blowing. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1021 to 1325 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

Associated soils in different landscape position are Hassock (T), Winhole (T) and Fishkill (T). Hassock (T) and Winhole (T) soils occur on upper landscape positions. Fishkill (T) soils occur in depressions and have a seasonal high water table within 25 cm. Hassock (T) soils have a water table at greater than 100 centimeters. Winhole (T) soils have a water table at 60 to 100 cm."

Other vegetation species includes mugwort, Golden Rod, Black locust, Tree of Heaven, Multiflora rose, Poison Ivy, Poplar, Black Cherry, Grey Birch, White Mulberry and Japanese knotweed. Planted species include Autumn Olive. Reclamation is unlikely because there is no natural vegetation to restore, and the areas vegetate naturally after deposition ceases. These soils are used for recreational development and wildlife refuge."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Flatland soils are mapped in the soil survey areas of the Gateway National Recreation Area and the initial survey areas of Kings and Queens Counties, NY. The soils are of minimal extent (less than 1,000 acres), however they are of unique importance to users of the soil surveys.\nFlatland soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition; excluding them from the concept of Fluvaquents. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy in ICOMANTH Circular Letter 7 developed for anthropogenic soils will help to clarify this difference.\nCarbolith is a name coined at West Virginia University to describe dark colored sedimentary rocks that will make a black or very dark (Munsell color value of 3 or less) streak or powder. Rocks under this name include coal not scheduled for mining, impure waste coal, bone coal, high carbon siltstones, and high carbon shales.\nFly ash supplies accumulated over more than one hundred years of time when hard coal was the main source of heating and producer of heat for production of electricity. The material often contains debris tossed into furnaces during burning.\nParticle size class control section characterization data from pedon S99NY047005 used for this soil.\nDue to the recent deposit of this material and the low organic matter content normal redoximorphic processes have not progressed. The aquic conditions have been observed and are being used as the basis for the classification.\nCEC activity class estimated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 cm (^Au horizon).\n2. Rock fragments in the particle-size control section averages less than 35 percent by volume.\n3. Aquic conditions - Aquic conditions observed between than 25 and 60 cm (^Au and ^Cu1 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
