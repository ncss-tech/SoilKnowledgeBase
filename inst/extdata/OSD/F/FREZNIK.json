    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Freznik soils are on plateaus and mountains. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived mainly from tuff, basalt, and minor amounts of chert and quartz latite. Slopes are 1 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,415 to 2,135 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
