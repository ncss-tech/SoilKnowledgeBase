  "OVERVIEW": "The Fayette series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on convex crests, interfluves and side slopes on uplands and on treads and risers on high stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.",
