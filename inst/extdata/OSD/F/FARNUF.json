  "OVERVIEW": "The Farnuf series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, glaciolacustrine, or glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, sedimentary plains, glacial lake plains, moraines, and outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 406 millimeters (about 16 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C (about 42 degrees F.)",
