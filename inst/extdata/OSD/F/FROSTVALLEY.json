  "OVERVIEW": "The Frostvalley series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources. Frostvalley soils are on stream terraces in mountain river valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1650 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
