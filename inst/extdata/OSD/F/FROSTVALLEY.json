  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Frostvalley soils are on linear to slightly convex positions on stream terraces in mountain river valleys. Slopes are 0 to 9 percent. Elevations are 730 to 825 meters. These soils formed in slope alluvium from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 1780 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C. Frost free season is about 60 to 120 days."
