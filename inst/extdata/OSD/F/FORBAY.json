The depth to free carbonates is greater than 203 cm. Volume of rock fragments throughout the upper mantle and fine loamy till ranges from 1 to 12 percent with 1 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 1 percent cobbles and 0 to 1 percent stones and boulders. Rock fragment content in the dense till ranges from 8 to 25 percent with 8 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones and boulders. The mantle averages less than 18 percent clay. The argillic horizon ranges from 18 to 25 percent clay. The fine loamy till ranges from 16 to 22 percent clay and contains less than 45 percent sand. The dense till ranges from 3 to 10 percent clay and contains less than 72 percent sand.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry color has a hue of 17.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E/B horizon, when present, does not meet the criteria for a glossic horizon.  The E part has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon, with a hue of 5 YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have mainly complex slopes with gradients of 8 to 45 percent. They are on shoulders and backslopes of moraines.  This soil formed in a discontinuous mantle of eolian or water laid sediments and the underlying friable till and the underlying dense loamy till. The till is from the Superior Lobe of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 625 to 750 mm. The frost free season ranges from 120 to 140 days. The elevation ranges from 300 to 500 meters above sea level."

Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
