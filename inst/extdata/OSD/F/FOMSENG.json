  "OVERVIEW": "The Fomseng series consists of shallow, well drained soils on uplands.  These soils formed in residuum derived from highly weathered basic igneous rock.  Slope is 15 to 100 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 206 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 81 degrees F.",
