The Canlodore, Castlepeak, Chena, Cryomont, Eklutna, Nataga, Nizina, Obscurity, Perfecto, Sofgran, and Studebaker soils are greater than 150 centimeters deep to bedrock. Dagget and Graylock soils are 100 to 150 centimeters to bedrock. Of the three soils with bedrock at 50 to 100 centimeters Alflack is formed in sandstone with coarse fragments consisting of channers and flagstones. Stecum soils are formed in micaceous granite and gneiss on foothills with a soil temperature of 5.5 to 8 degrees centigrade. Whittell soils have an Oi horizon and lack a C horizon on the surface."

These soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite. Elevation is 2860 to 3320 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cool, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 1016 to 1397 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is 1 to 3 degrees C. The frost free season is less than 30 days."
