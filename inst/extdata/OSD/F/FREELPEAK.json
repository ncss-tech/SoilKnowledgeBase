  "OVERVIEW": "The Freelpeak series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite.  The Freelpeak soils are on the summit and shoulders of mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1016 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",

The Canlodore, Castlepeak, Chena, Cryomont, Eklutna, Nataga, Nizina, Obscurity, Perfecto, Sofgran, and Studebaker soils are greater than 150 centimeters deep to bedrock. Dagget and Graylock soils are 100 to 150 centimeters to bedrock. Of the three soils with bedrock at 50 to 100 centimeters Alflack is formed in sandstone with coarse fragments consisting of channers and flagstones. Stecum soils are formed in micaceous granite and gneiss on foothills with a soil temperature of 5.5 to 8 degrees centigrade. Whittell soils have an Oi horizon and lack a C horizon on the surface."
