  "OVERVIEW": "The Fairylawn series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils with very slow permeability that formed in alluvium and loess from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  Fairylawn soils are on tablelands and structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Average annual temperature is 8.3 degrees C. and average annual precipitation is 330 mm.",
