Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and loess from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 380 mm, and the average annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 8.9 degrees C. The frost-free period is 85 to 110 days."
