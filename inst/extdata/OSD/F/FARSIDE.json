  "OVERVIEW": "The Farside series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from gneiss, schist and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
