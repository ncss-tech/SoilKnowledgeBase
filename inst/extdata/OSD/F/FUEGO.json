  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry 65 to 90 days within the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Pumiceous ash comprises 5 to 30 percent by volume of the fine earth fraction.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick.  The texture control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 12 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 35 gravel and up to 25 percent cobbles and stones by volume.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is sandy loam and has 12 to 18 percent clay, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and stones and 35 to 50 percent gravel by volume.  This horizon is slightly acid or mildly alkaline."

Bergquist and St. Marys soils are 40 to 60 inches or more over bedrock.  Bigarm, Bradshaw, and Potamus soils lack bedrock above a 60 inch depth.  Everwhite soils lack cambic horizons and lack the influence of ashy parent material.  Mud Springs soils have B horizons that are hard or very hard when dry, lack the influence of ashy parent material, and formed in granitic residuum."

The soils formed in very gravelly detritus weathered from porphyritic andesite and similar coarse-grained rocks.  The climate is subhumid with mean annual precipitation of 14 to 18 inches.  Mean January temperature is 25 degrees to 27 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 60 degrees to 62 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 40 degrees to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 20 to 80 days."
