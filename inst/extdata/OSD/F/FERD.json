  "OVERVIEW": "The Ferd series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, drainageways, stream terraces, and till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
