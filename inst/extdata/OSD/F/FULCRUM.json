The soils formed in residuum and alluvium from vitric tuff and flow-breccia.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 360 to 410 mm, and average annual temperature is 4.4 to 6.1 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 65 to 80 days."
