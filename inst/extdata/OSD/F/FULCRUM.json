  "OVERVIEW": "The Fulcrum series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in residuum and alluvium from vitric tuff and breccia.  Fulcrum soils are on extrusive domes.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the average annual air temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
