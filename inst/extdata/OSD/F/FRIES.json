    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 18 inches. Rock fragments are of mixed lithology and mainly are less than 3 inches in diameter, but stones are in some pedons below the A and AB horizons.\nThe Ap and AB (or A) horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, or are neutral; value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry); and chroma of 0 to 2. They are silty clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 0 to 2. It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC or Bw horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 1 to 10 percent. It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fries soils are on lake plains or till plains and have plane or concave slopes. The soils formed in glacial till 20 to 32 inches thick and are underlain by shale bedrock that is weathered in the upper part. Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 600 to 780 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 34 to 36 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 50 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free period is 155 to 200 days."

Pewamo soils occupy positions similar to Fries but commonly are further from shale ridges and are deeper to shale. Allis and Prout soils are on slightly higher topographic positions."
