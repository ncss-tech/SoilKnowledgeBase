  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Franeau soils were formerly included with the Francitas series. The name Franeau is coined.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 69 cm (0 to 27 in) (A1, A2, Bssg1, Bssg2 horizon).\nCambic horizon  69 to 203 cm (27 to 80 in) (Bssg3, Bssg4, Bssg5, and Bssg5 horizons).\nAquic features - redoximorphic features 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in) and aquic conditions in the upper part of the pedon in most years.\nVertic features - Slickensides at a depth of 25 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in).\nNatric features - SAR of 13 or more within 100 cm of the surface\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This is a cyclic soil and undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls 10 to 15 cm (4 to 6 in) higher than microdepressions. Distance from the center of the microknoll to the center of the microdepression ranges from about 2.4 to 4.9 m (8 to 16 ft). The amplitude of waviness between mollic colored materials in the upper part of the solum and the higher value colors in the lower part ranges from about 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 in). The chimneys of high value materials on the microknolls make up less than 5 percent of the surface area. They are mainly 1.5 to 3 m (5 to 10 ft) long and 0.9 to 1.5 m) 3 to 5 ft wide. When dry, the soil has cracks 1/2 to 2 in wide at the surface and commonly 1.5 cm (1/2 in) wide cracks extend to a depth of 0.6 m (2 ft) during the summer.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
