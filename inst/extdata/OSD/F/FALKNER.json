  "OVERVIEW": "The Falkner series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils in uplands and on stream terraces of the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands (MLRA 134), the Alabama, Mississippi and Arkansas Blackland Prairies (MLRA 135), and the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A) Major Land Resource Areas. They formed in a thin silty mantle and the underlying clayey marine deposits.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 48 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

The control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent clay.  In some pedons soft shale bedrock is below a depth of 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A, Ap, E and Bt horizons, except in areas where the surface layer has been limed and from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the 2Bt and 2Btg horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.

Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in a mantle of loess or silty alluvium, about 1.5 to 3 feet thick, and the underlying clayey material.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 48 inches."

The poorly drained Adaton, Calhoun, and Henry soils are in depressions, in broad drainageways, and flats.  In addition, Henry soils have a fragipan and have coarse-silty control sections.  The somewhat poorly drained Bude, Calloway, and Pheba soils are in drainageways and on lower slopes in the terrain and have fragipans. In addition, Pheba soils have coarse-silty control sections and are Ultisols.  Longview soils are on similar positions, do not have clayey lower 2Bt subsoils and have interfingering of E horizon material around peds of the Bt horizon.  The moderately well drained Oktibbeha soils are on higher positions, have redder upper subsoils and have more than 60 percent smectite clay in the control section.  The moderately well drained Providence soils are on higher positions and have a fragipan.  The moderately well drained Tippah soils are on higher positions, have mixed mineralogy and redder subsoils."
