  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 60 inches.  The silty upper part of the solum above the clayey layer is 15 to 40 inches in thickness. The control section ranges from 20 to 35 percent clay.  In some pedons soft shale bedrock is below a depth of 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A, Ap, E and Bt horizons, except in areas where the surface layer has been limed and from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the 2Bt and 2Btg horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silt, silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe upper part of Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Iron depletions in shades of gray range from none to few.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe lower part of Bt horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6; or there is no dominant color and is variegated in shades of gray, red, brown or yellow.  Iron depletions in shades of gray range from few to many.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6; or there is no dominant color and is variegated in shades of yellow, brown, gray or red.  Iron depletions in shades of gray range from common to many.  Small stress surfaces on faces of peds range from none to common.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown or red range from few to many.  A few small stress surfaces commonly are on the faces of peds.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Falkner soils are in broad areas of low relief in the uplands and on stream terraces of the Southern Mississippi Silty Uplands, the Blackland Prairie, and the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in a mantle of loess or silty alluvium, about 1.5 to 3 feet thick, and the underlying clayey material.  The climate is humid subtropical.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 48 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Adaton, Bude, Calhoun, Calloway, Henry, Longview, Oktibbeha, Pheba, Providence and Tippah series.  The poorly drained Adaton, Calhoun, and Henry soils are in depressions, in broad drainageways, and flats.  In addition, Henry soils have a fragipan and have coarse-silty control sections.  The somewhat poorly drained Bude, Calloway, and Pheba soils are in drainageways and on lower slopes in the terrain and have fragipans. In addition, Pheba soils have coarse-silty control sections and are Ultisols.  Longview soils are on similar positions, do not have clayey lower 2Bt subsoils and have interfingering of E horizon material around peds of the Bt horizon.  The moderately well drained Oktibbeha soils are on higher positions, have redder upper subsoils and have more than 60 percent smectite clay in the control section.  The moderately well drained Providence soils are on higher positions and have a fragipan.  The moderately well drained Tippah soils are on higher positions, have mixed mineralogy and redder subsoils."
