  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The lower one half of the series control section is saturated for 21 days beyond the summer solstice in 6 years out of 10.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 80 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 60 inches.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is 25 to 48 inches.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages between 18 and 28 percent clay and 35 and 55 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or loam.  It is neutral or slightly acid.  Grainy coats on faces of peds and thin incipient E horizons are present in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 1 to 5 percent by volume and are commonly 2 to 20 mm in size.\nAB horizon has colors and textures and reaction similar to the A and 2Btg horizons.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam. It is slightly alkaline to moderately acid.  Rock fragments ranges from 1 to 8 percent by volume and are commonly 2 to 20 mm in size.\nThe 2BCg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 20 percent.  Rock fragment range from 1 to 10 percent by volume and are commonly 2 to 20 mm in size.  Clay content is 10 to 18 percent.  Some pedons have a 2Bkg, 2Bg or a Cg horizon."

The Alvada soil is not currently in the OSD file. Buntingville soils are not saturated in the soil moisture control section during the 30 days following the summer solstice.  Berville and Clackamas soils have more than 5 percent gravel in the upper 1/3 of the series control section.  Brookston and Jameston soils average more than 25 percent clay in the upper 1/3 of the series control section.  Cordova and Nosoni soils average more than 27 percent clay in the middle 1/3  of the series control section.  Barry, Marengo and Rensselaer soils have a mollic epipedon less than 24 inches thick.  Hamel soils have less than 35 percent fine sand and coarser in the middle 1/3 of the series control section.  Navan soils average more than 28 percent clay in the lower 1/3 of the series control section.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They have formed in loamy colluvium and the underlying calcareous loamy glacial till of the Wadena Lobe of the Late Wisconsin glaciation.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches.  The number of frost free days ranges from 140 to 155 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1050 to 1250 feet."

Koronis and Sunburg are well drained and higher lying.  The somewhat poorly drained Marcellon soils are on low summits.  The poorly drained Uniongrove soils are on nearly level, plane to slightly concave positions and do not have an argillic horizon.  Poorly drained Swedegrove soils are on rims of depressions and are calcareous throughout.  Very poorly drained Lundlake soils are in closed depressions."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are: Mollic epipedon-the zone from the surface of the soil to 43 inches-(Ap, A1, A2, AB horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from a depth of 43 inches to 60 inches-(Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).  Other features: aquic moisture condition-redoximorphic concentrations in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and low chroma matrix with redoximorphic concentrations below the mollic epipedon. 1/20/2011-TYPE LOCATION error was corrected.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to Minnesota Agricultural Experiment Station Central File Code numbers 4198, 4535 and 4534 for results of laboratory analyses of some pedons of this series.
