  "OVERVIEW": "The Flotag series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in mudflow deposits derived from mixed volcanic ash and basaltic and andesitic sand and gravel. Flotag soils are on low terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
