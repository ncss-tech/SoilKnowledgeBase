  "OVERVIEW": "The Frodo series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basaltic rock.  Frodo soils are on remnants of lava plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
