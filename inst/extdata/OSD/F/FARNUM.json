Added precipitation pattern to geographic settings. Removed Carway and Taver from geographically associated soils. Added secondary carbonates to remarks. Updated Keys to Soil Taxonomy to twelfth edition.\nADDITIONAL DATA: For additional information, refer to Soil Survey Investigation Report No.4, pages 22 to 25. The type location was moved in 1999 with the correlation of the Reno County, Kansas update. NSSL lab pedon number 40A1785 (pedon ID S1958KS155005) is from near the original type location. Other samples that support this series are: NSSL lab sample number 97P0098 (pedon ID 96KS155415), 40A1786 (pedon ID S1958KS155009), and 06N1020 (pedon ID S2006KS185903).\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
