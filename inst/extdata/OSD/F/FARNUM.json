  "OVERVIEW": "The Farnum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium. Farnum soils are on paleoterraces in river valleys of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm (28 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F) at the type location.",
