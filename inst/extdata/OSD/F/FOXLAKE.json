  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features identified in this soil are: Mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 19 inches (Ap and A horizons); cambic horizon--the zone from 19 to 49 inches (Bg and Bkg horizons); aquic moisture condition based on low chroma matrix below the mollic epipedon.  This soil could be challenged for an Epiaquert.  It is marginal to the Vertisol order and was felt that the current classification was more appropriate at this time.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to MAES Central File Code No. 3698 and 4568 for results of some laboratory data on representative pedons.
