Bon, Draper, Humbarger, Shanta, St. Onge and Umbarg soils are calcareous throughout.  Manzano and Mauricanyon soils contain segregated lime in the lower control section and do not have buried horizons.  Lynx soils have ustic aridic soil moisture regimes.  Mauricanyon, Maskell and Merrick soils are moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June.  Pack soils have redoximorphic features at depths less than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frazwell series are on fan terraces and in draws of fan terraces.  Elevations are 5500 to 6000 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches.  Approximately half the precipitation falls during the winter months as snow and rain.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 120 to 160 days."

Bleumont and Disterheff soils have fine textured argillic horizons and lack a mollic epipedon.  Buckndoe soils have loamy-skeletal particle size control sections.  Thunderbird soils are moderately deep to basalt.  Milkweed soils are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon."
