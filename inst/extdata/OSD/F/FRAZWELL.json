  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Frazwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces and in draws of fan terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Slope is 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
