  "OVERVIEW": "The Forrest series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan alluvium.  Forrest soils are on basin floors, fan terraces, and fan piedmonts and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
