  "OVERVIEW": "The Fagasa series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on ridges and mountainsides. These soils formed in residuum of weathered basic igneous rock. Slope is 30 to 130 percent. Elevation is near sea level to 2,100 feet. The mean annual rainfall is about 200 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F.",
