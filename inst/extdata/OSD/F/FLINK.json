  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to stratified silty, loamy, and sandy glaciofluvial deposits range from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 25 to 50 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum .\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral in hue. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; and value and chroma of 2 or 3.   It is loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.  The amount of ortstein in the Bhs horizon ranges from 0 to 50 percent.  The ortstein is in irregular random chunks or tongues up to 3 inches in diameter.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.   It has texture and ortstein content like the Bhs described above.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand or fine sand.  BC horizons with spodic color have pH of 6.0 or more or have organic carbon content less than 0.6 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand or fine sand.\nThe 2Cg or 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 6.  It typically is stratified with layers of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam and with strata of coarser texture.  Less typically, it has thin strata of finer texture."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Flink soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, outwash terraces, lake terraces, and to a lesser extent on old beach ridges.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 4 percent.  These soils formed in sandy outwash underlain by stratified silty, loamy, and sandy glaciofluvial deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 135 days. Elevation ranges from 600 to 1900 feet."

The excessively drained Vilas soils, the moderately well drained Croswell soils, the somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils, and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Kinross soils form a drainage sequence on nearby landscapes where the sandy mantle is more than 60 inches deep.  The moderately well drained Cublake soils and the well drained Sultz soils form a drainage sequence with Flink soils."

Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or moderate in the stratified glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period September to June in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed coniferous and deciduous forest.  Common trees are balsam fir, red pine, white pine, eastern hemlock, paper birch, red maple and quaking aspen.  Common understory species are blueberry, American hazel, sweet scented bedstraw, wintergreen, yellow beadlily, bunchberry dogwood, and sedges.  A few areas are used for cropland or pastureland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay."
