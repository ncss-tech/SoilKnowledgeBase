  "OVERVIEW": "The Flink series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in deep sandy outwash underlain by stratified silty, loamy, and sandy glaciofluvial deposits  on outwash plains, lake plains, outwash terraces, and lake terraces.  Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the sandy outwash and moderately slow or moderate in the stratified glaciofluvial deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum .\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral in hue. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.  The O horizon is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy sand, sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.

The amount of ortstein in the Bhs horizon ranges from 0 to 50 percent.  The ortstein is in irregular random chunks or tongues up to 3 inches in diameter.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.   It has texture and ortstein content like the Bhs described above.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand or fine sand.  BC horizons with spodic color have pH of 6.0 or more or have organic carbon content less than 0.6 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.

It typically is stratified with layers of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam and with strata of coarser texture.  Less typically, it has thin strata of finer texture."
