  "OVERVIEW": "The Firesteel series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in calcareous silty sediments overlying soft siltstone on uplands. These soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to siltstone ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  A thin mantle of loamy glacial sediments is at the surface of some pedons.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 20 to 30 percent.  The soil ranges from mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bky horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Gypsum crystals are common or many.  Small siltstone fragments are in some pedons.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 70 percent.  Some pedons have a C horizon.\nThe Cr horizon has color ranges similar to the Bky horizon.  It is soft siltstone having thicky platy bedrock structure.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 50 to 90 percent."

The well drained Betts, Ethan, and Gavins soils are on steeper parts of the landscape.  Blendon, Bon, and Prosper soils are on similar landscapes.  Blendon soils are coarse-loamy and do not have Cr horizons of siltstone.   Bon and Prosper soils are fine-loamy, have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick, and do not have Cr horizons of siltstone. Enet soils are on similar landscapes, are moderately deep over sand and gravel, and are better drained.  Clarno and Houdek soils are fine-loamy and formed in glacial till on higher landscapes.  Redstoe soils are on nearby uplands and are better drained."
