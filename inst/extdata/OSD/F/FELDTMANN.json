  "REVDATE": "4/90",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Feldtmann series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils on former beaches and shorelines of Lake Superior.  They formed in sandy deposits. Permeability is very rapid.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Reaction of the A horizon ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid, and the reaction of the C horizons ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR; value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand or sand.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 10R; and value of 3 or 4. They are loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand or the gravelly analogues of these textures."
