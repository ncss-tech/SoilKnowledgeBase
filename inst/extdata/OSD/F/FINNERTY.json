Depth to uniformly calcareous materials ranges from 0 to 10 inches. Some pedons have some visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Gypsum content averages 0 to 5 percent. exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils are moderately or strongly alkaline. Rock fragments of gravel size range from 0 to 5 percent. Some pedons have mottles of low chroma below a depth of 20 inches. The control section is clay and has more than 60 percent clay. The A and C horizons have hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4."

These soils formed in thick, calcareous, very fine textured alluvial materials. at the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months. mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 69 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 110 to 140 days."
