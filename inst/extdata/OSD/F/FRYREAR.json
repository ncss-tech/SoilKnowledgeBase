The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The solum contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  Reaction is neutral throughout.  Phosphate retention is 40 to 70 percent.  The acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate extractable iron is 0.40 to 1.0 percent.  Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent by ammonium acetate.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Field estimated clay content is 10 to 20 percent throughout the profile.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 5 to 10 percent gravel, 5 to 10 percent cobbles and 15 to 40 percent stones, with a total of 25 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 moist and 4 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry.
