  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 21 to 40 inches thick and usually extends to the substratum, although in some pedons mottled B2 horizons of low chroma occur between the mollic epipedon and the IIC horizon.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges fro 0 to 10 inches.  Depth to lithic contact or a paralithic contact ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to the IICg horizon ranges from 26 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the control section is typically sandy loam but averages 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 50 to 82 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the upper part of the control section and average less than 35 percent in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  They are mainly less than 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A2 horizon ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fleer soils are on flood plains and low terraces.  Slopes typically range from 0 to about 6 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse alluvial sediments that are underlain by beds of sand and gravel.  At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 37 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 57 degrees F."
