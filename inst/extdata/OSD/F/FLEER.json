  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fleer series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvial sediments that are underlain by beds of sand and gravel.  Fleer soils are on flood plains and low terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
