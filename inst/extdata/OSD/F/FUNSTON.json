  "OVERVIEW": "The Funston series consists of very deep, poorly or very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Funston soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
