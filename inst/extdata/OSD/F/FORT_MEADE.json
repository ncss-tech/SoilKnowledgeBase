  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fort Meade series consists of very deep, well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in moderately thick beds of loamy sand on uplands overlying or mixed with phosphatic materials.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A or Ap horizon and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the C horizons.  Profiles have more than 12 percent fines and extend to depths of 80 inches or more.  Pebbles of phosphate rock or of concretionary material enriched with phosphate may or may not be in all or any one of the horizons described.  Total content of weathered phosphatic and iron pebbles in the soil ranges from 0 to 5 percent, by volume. These pebbles range from 4 to 20 mm in size.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 through 8. Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Orlando soils have uniform texture of sand or fine sand with 1 to 12 percent fines that extends to depths of 80 inches or more. Other closely related soils are the Gainesville and Sellers series.  Gainesville soils do not have an umbric or a mollic epipedon.  Sellers soils are very poorly drained."

Arredondo, Candler, and Tavares soils lack an umbric or mollic epipedon.  In addition, Arredondo soils have an argillic horizon at depths between 40 and 80 inches.  Candler soils have sand or fine sand texture throughout and have lamellae within depths of 80 inches.  Tavares soils have a water table between depths of 40 to 60 inches during the rainy season."

Native vegetation is dominated by longleaf pine,  slash pine and loblolly pine, laurel oak, live oak, post oak and turkey oak along with dogwood, hickory, cabbage palm and magnolia. The understory consists of widely spaced sawpalmetto, pineland threeawn, bluestems, lopsided indiangrass, paspalum and panicums."
