  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the calcic horizon is 25 to 40 inches. Depth to calcareous material is 0 to 4 inches. Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Fernando soils have 50 to 80 percent silt in the solum and have 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is usually loam, silt loam, or clay loam, but is cobbly loam in some pedons.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam. This horizon has weak medium or coarse prismatic structure parting to moderate or strong medium or coarse subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR. It is soft to semi-indurated.  It contains 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate."

Balon, Bowbac, Fort Collins, Gaddes, Harbord, Maysdorf, Potts and Stoneham soils lack a calcic horizon. Bowbac, Cushman, Fattig, Hagerman, Progresso and Pugsley soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Cerrillos, Millett and Toluca soils have solum thickness of less than 20 inches. Clovis, Fort Collins, Harbord, Maysdorf, Olney, Penistaja and Stoneham soils have less than 50 percent silt in the B2t horizon.  Los Alamos soils have highly pumiceous material at depths of 20 to 50 inches. Pokeman soils have gypsum or alabaster at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Scholle soils have 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control section. Spenlo soils have solum thickness of more than .40 inches.  Tapia soils have a weakly cemented layer of caliche fragments at depths of 16 to 35 inches."
