  "OVERVIEW": "The Foxlane series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in alluvium from igneous rocks and fine pyroclastic materials. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent in mountain valleys and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
