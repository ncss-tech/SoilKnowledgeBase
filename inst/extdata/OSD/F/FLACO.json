  "OVERVIEW": "The Flaco series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and windblown sediments derived from basalt.  Flaco soils are on old basalt capped mesas.  Slope is 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
