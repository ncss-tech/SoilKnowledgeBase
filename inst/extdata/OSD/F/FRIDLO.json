These soils formed in lacustrine deposits or alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

USU lab data validates the activity class.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 208-209, Table 9 of the Soil Survey of Box Elder County, Utah, Eastern Part.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from a 1:5 soil-water dilution.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
