  "OVERVIEW": "Fridlo series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits or alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary rocks.  Fridlo soils are on lake terraces and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
