  "OVERVIEW": "The Foxhill series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess influenced alluvium from mixed sources.  These soils are on valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.2 degrees C.",
