The following series are similar and some may qualify as Vertic; Devoy, Embargo, Home Camp, Lemco (T), Passar, Redchief, Resoot (T), Rooset, Spinlin, Tatiyee, Tellura, Threedot (T), Wesdy (T), and Wilpar series.  The Devoy, Embargo, and Home Camp soils have a lithic contact above 40 inches.  Lemco soils have a O horizon and precipitation greater than 22 inches.  Passar soils have rock fragments mainly larger than 10 inches.  Redchief soils are medium to strongly acid.  Resoot soils have lime below 22 inches.  Rooset soils lack 10YR hues in the argillic horizon and recieve equal amounts of precipitation during most months.  Tatiyee soils have ustic soil moisture regimes.  Tellura soils have lime below 40 inches.  Threedot soils have E horizons.  Wesdy (T) have a udic soil moisture regime.  Spinlin soils have highly weathered bedrock above 40 inches.  Wilpar soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F."
