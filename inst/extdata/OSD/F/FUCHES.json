    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Fuches soils are on backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum weathered from acidic tuff or rhyolite. Elevation is 675 to 975 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 970 to 1190 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 13 to 15 degrees C. The frost free season is 195 to 245 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Swissranch, Supan, Crozier, McCarthy, and Iron Mountain soils. The Swissranch soils occur in pockets in similar hillslope positions as Fuches, but are very deep to bedrock and under natural conditions support native tree species. Supan, Iron Mountain, Crozier and McCarthy soils develop from more basic volcanic rocks such as basic tuff breccia, tuff, or agglomerate. Supan, Crozier, and McCarthy soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Iron Mountain soils have a mollic epipedon."
