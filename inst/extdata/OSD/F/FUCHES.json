  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fuches series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in colluvium and/or residuum derived from rhyolite or acidic tuff. The Fuches soils are on backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1020 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.",

The Swissranch soils occur in pockets in similar hillslope positions as Fuches, but are very deep to bedrock and under natural conditions support native tree species. Supan, Iron Mountain, Crozier and McCarthy soils develop from more basic volcanic rocks such as basic tuff breccia, tuff, or agglomerate. Supan, Crozier, and McCarthy soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Iron Mountain soils have a mollic epipedon."
