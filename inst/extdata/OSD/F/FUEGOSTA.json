  "OVERVIEW": "The Fuegosta series consist of shallow over duripan well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Fuegosta soils are on erosional fan remnants of fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
