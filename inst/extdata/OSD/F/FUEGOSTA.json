These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources, mainly volcanic tuffs with minor amounts of quartzite and limestone.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,394 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool moist winters.  Summers are hot and dry with occasional convection storms.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C, and the frost-free season is about 130 to 200 days."
