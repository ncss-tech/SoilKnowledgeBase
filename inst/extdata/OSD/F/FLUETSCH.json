  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 55 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 8 to 30 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 8 to 40 inches, but such horizons are not strong enough to qualify as calcic or gypsic horizons.  ESP either remains constant or increases with increasing depth ranging from 0 to 15 percent in the solum but exceeding 15 percent in the Cca horizon in some pedons.   Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above a depth of 40 inches and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches predominate.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5 YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically sandy clay loam but averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 30 percent silt, and 45 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and has about 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alcova, Almy, Elk Hollow, Forelle, Heflin, Rewah, Rock River, Satanta, Stummer, and Wolford series.  Alcova soils have loamy-skeletal substratums at depths of less than 40 inches.  Almy soils have lithochromic hue of 5YR or redder and have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the argillic horizon.  Elk Hollow, Rock River, and Wolford soils have very thin solums that are less than 12 inches thick to the base of the argillic horizon.  Forelle soils have siltier argillic horizons with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rewah and Satanta soils have a paralithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Stunner soils have 15 to 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the argillic horizon and have a calcic horizon.  Heflin soils are noncalcareous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fluetsch soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans, terraces, and valley side slopes.  Slopes typically range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous, moderately coarse textured alluvial fan sediments derived principally from sandstone and sandy shales.  At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer.  The average annual temperature is 38 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 57 degrees F."
