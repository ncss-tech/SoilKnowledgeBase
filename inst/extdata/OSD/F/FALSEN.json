The particle-size control section averages less than 45 percent fine and very fine sand, more than 35 percent medium and coarser sand and more than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand.  The soil has less than 5 percent coarse fragments throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1.  Chroma of 2 is allowed in the lower part.  It is coarse sand, sand, loamy coarse sand or loamy sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 2 or 3.

Osakis soils are underlain by sand and gravel at depths of 12 to 20 inches.  Walum soils contain 50 percent or more shale in the sand or coarser fraction.  Weeding soils occur above elevations of more than 4,200 feet and have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick."

The Hecla soils are on similar landscape positions.  The Arvilla, Claire, Lohnes and Maddock soils are on higher positions on the landscape and are excessively to well drained.  In addition, Lohnes and Maddock soils do not have redoximoprphic features within a depth of 40 inches.  Maddock and Ulen soils are dominated by fine sand. The Karlsruhe and Ulen soils are in shallow depressions. They are somewhat poorly drained and have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches. The poorly drained Verendrye soils are in deep depressions."
