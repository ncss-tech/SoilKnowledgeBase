  "OVERVIEW": "The Forbesville series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Forbesville soils are on old alluvial terraces and have slopes of 2 to 15 Percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F.",

The soil between the depths of 7 and 21 inches is dry in all parts from June 1 to October 15 and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 15.  Base saturation is 50 to 75 percent throughout (sum of cations).\nThe A horizon is 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR 4/4, 5/4 or 5/6.  Moist color is 5YR or 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/4.  Moist value and chroma of 3.5 or less occur only in the upper 6 inches.  It is loam or gravelly loam with 5 to 30 percent pebbles and is strongly to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6 or 6/6.  Moist color is 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6 or 5/6.  It is heavy clay loam or clay or their gravelly or very gravelly equivalents.  It is strongly or moderately acid.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages 35 to 55 percent clay and 0 to 30 percent pebbles.  Clay increase by 15 to 20 percent (absolute) or more from the BA horizon to the upper Bt horizon and has a clear or abrupt upper boundary."
