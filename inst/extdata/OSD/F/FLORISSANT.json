  "OVERVIEW": "The Florissant series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from tuff and shale.  Florissant soils are on pediments.  Slopes range from 15 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

This soil was originally proposed in 1943 as moderately deep to carbonate cemented sediments or bedrock, and later classified as fine, montmorillonitic Argic Cryoborolls. The 02/2010 revision changes the series concept to a similar soil identified during the more recent soil survey and moves the typical pedon."
