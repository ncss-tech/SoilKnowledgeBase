    "section": "SERIES ESTABLISHED",
    "content": "SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Teller County, Colorado, Teller-Park soil survey area, Colorado, 2010. The name is from the nearby community. This soil was originally proposed in 1943 as moderately deep to carbonate cemented sediments or bedrock, and later classified as fine, montmorillonitic Argic Cryoborolls. The 02/2010 revision changes the series concept to a similar soil identified during the more recent soil survey and moves the typical pedon."
