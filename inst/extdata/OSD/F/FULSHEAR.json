Depth to soft powdery secondary carbonates ranges from 28 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is a loam, fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  The Bt1 is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  The Bt2 horizon is sandy clay, clay loam or clay.  The weighted average clay content of the upper Bt ranges from 28 to 35 percent.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt3 and Bt4 horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  They are sandy clay loam, clay loam or sandy clay.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fulshear soils are on uplands, mainly along breaks to natural drains.  Slopes are convex and gradients range from 1 to 8 percent.  The soil formed in alkaline loamy sediments of Pleistocene age.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 45 inches and it is about evenly distributed throughout the year. The mean annual temperature is 68 to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E index is 50 to 70."

Benard, Edna, Katy, and Lake Charles soils have low chroma mottling due to wetness.  In addition, Benard and Edna soils have a COLE of more than 0.09.  Hockley and Katy soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Kenny soils have grossarenic surface layers.  Lake Charles soils have intersecting slickensides."
