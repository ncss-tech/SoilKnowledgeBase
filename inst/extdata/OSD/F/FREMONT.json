  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 61 to 140 cm (24 to 55 inches.). Depth to shale bedrock is greater than 102 cm (40 in) for deep phase; greater than 152 cm (60 inches) for very deep phase. Rock fragments, mainly channers of shale and siltstone, range from 5 to 35 percent in the solum and from 20 to 60 percent in C horizon. The soil ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid unless limed above a depth of 102 cm (40 in) and from strongly acid through neutral below a depth of 102 cm (40 in).\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular structure sometimes parting from subangular blocky and very friable or friable consistence.\nSome undisturbed pedons have an A horizon 5 to 10 cm (2 to 4 in) thick with color, texture, and structure similar to Ap horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 with distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, medium or coarse prismatic structure parting to weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky, or the prisms are absent. It has friable or firm consistence.\nThe BC horizon, when present, has color and texture ranges similar to the B horizon. It has weak, medium or coarse prismatic structure parting to weak fine to coarse subangular blocky, or the prisms are absent. Consistence is firm and hard.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4 with distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. The material is massive or has plate like divisions, with rock structure evident in most pedons. Consistence is firm and hard."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Orpark series. Orpark soils have bedrock within a depth of 100 cm (40 in).\nThe Atherton, Burdett, Darien, Greene, Hornell, Kendaia, and Volusia series are in related families. Atherton and Kendaia soils are nonacid. Burdett and Darien soils have argillic horizons. Hornell soils have a fine particle-size control section and are moderately deep. Greene soils have bedrock within a depth of 102 cm (40 in). Volusia soils have a fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fremont soils are on broad hilltops and hillsides, and receive little runoff from adjacent areas. Slope ranges from 0 to 40 percent. The soils developed in till derived from shale, and some siltstone and sandstone. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 795 to 1725 mm (31 to 68 in) and mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 11 degrees C. (43 to 52 degrees F.). The growing season is from 110 to 150 days."

Alden and Chippewa soils are poorly or very poorly drained. Arnot and Tuller soils have bedrock between depths of 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 in). Hornell, Lordstown, Manlius, and Orpark soils have bedrock between depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 in). Erie, Langford, Mardin, Marilla, and Volusia soils have fragipans."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of this soil have been cleared, and used for growing corn, small grains, hay, pasture, and potatoes. Because the soils are slow to warm up in the spring due to wetness many areas are reverting to woodland. Native vegetation is sugar maple, oak, white ash, yellow birch, hemlock, and white pine."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: As formerly mapped, the Fremont series included parts of the range of the Mardin and Volusia series. The present concept of the Fremont series does not include soils with fragipans.\nAdjusted the coordinates (latitude seconds) to be:  420 52' 59.2\", 780 21' 55\" NAD83 to put point off of map unit boundary.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric Epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (7 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 71 cm ( 7 to 28 in) (Bw horizons).\n3. Aquepts suborder - aquic moisture regime, and evidence of wetness that includes 2 chroma on all ped faces and redox features in the zone from 30 to 46 cm (12 to 18 in) (Bw2 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for the Fremont series can be found at the NCSS Soil Characterization Database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
