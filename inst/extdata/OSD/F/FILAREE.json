Agustin, Lostman, and Pajarito soils are moderately alkaline and calcareous above 20 inches. Hayhook, Pajarito and Sahuarita soils are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days cumulative during July-September. Nasagold soils are receive less total rainfall, are effervescent above 20 inches and have lower average clay content in the control section. Pyxo soils are moderately deep to sedimentary bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Filaree soils are on fan terraces and fan aprons. Elevations are 2,000 to 4,000 feet. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F. The frost free period is 200 to 280 days."
