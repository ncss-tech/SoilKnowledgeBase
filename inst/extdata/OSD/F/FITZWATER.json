  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fitzwater soils are on plateaus, canyons, hills and mountains. They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or tuff. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. Elevations range from 1,250 to 2,290 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
