  "OVERVIEW": "The Fitzwater series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt or tuff. Fitzwater soils are on plateaus, canyons, hills and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
