  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches thick.  The depth to loamy fine sand or coarser sediments is less than 20 inches.  The average texture in the particle-size control section has greater than 55 percent fine sand and very fine sand, less than 30 percent medium sand and coarser, and less than 15 percent silt plus clay.  These soils typically have carbonates in all parts, except the upper 10 inches of the A horizon in some pedons.  A slight accumulation of carbonates commonly is in the A horizon or Bk horizon or both, but the maximum content of carbonates is less than 15 percent.  Typically they are nonsaline, but some areas range to 15 mmhos/cm.  They typically do not have rock fragments, but a few pedons contain as much as 5 percent by volume of rock fragments or very fine gravel, in the lower part of the C horizon.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or less.  It commonly has redoximorphic features in some part.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  Coarser textures of sand and fine sand are in the lower part of some pedons.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and typically a chroma of 1 or 2.  However, part of the C horizon in some pedons has chroma of 3.  The C horizon has few to many redoximorphic features.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Sandy loam or fine sandy loam is in the upper part of some pedons.\n2C horizons of loamy glacial till or with up to 35 percent gravel are as shallow as 40 inches in some pedons."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or concave slopes with gradient of 2 percent or less on glacial lake and outwash plains.  They formed in calcareous sandy glaciolacustrine or outwash sediments of late Wisconsin Age.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 48 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 105 to 140 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 2350 feet."

The Flaming, Hecla and Ulen soils are somewhat poorly and moderately well drained and are on slightly higher lying terrain.  The Maddock soils are well drained and are on higher lying terrain.  The poorly drained Hamar soils are on flats.  The very poorly drained Venlo soils are in depressions."
