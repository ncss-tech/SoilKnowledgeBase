  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ft. Drum series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on low ridges and flats that border sloughs and depressional areas in the lower Coastal Plain of Florida.  They formed in sandy marine sediments influenced by calcareous materials.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizons, from moderately acid to neutral in the E horizon, and from slightly acid  to moderately alkaline in the Bk and C horizons.\nThe A horizons have hue of 10YR, value 3 to 5, chroma 1 to 3.  Where value of these horizons is less than 4, the total thickness is less than 6 inches.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value 5 to 7, and chroma 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 6 to 8, chroma of 2 or less; or there is no dominant matrix color and it is multicolored in shades of gray, brown, and yellow.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown or yellow range from few to common.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value 5 or 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, and brown range from none to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand."

Bradenton, Felda, and Manatee soils are very poorly drained.  Immokalee, Myakka, and Wabasso soils have Bh horizons.  Keri soils have a sandy clay loam argillic horizon in which more than 1/3 of the clay fraction consists of carbonates.  Parkwood soils have an A horizon that meets all of the requirements for a mollic epipedon except for thickness and also have an argillic horizon."
