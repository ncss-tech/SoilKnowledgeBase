Coombs and Thompsonflat soils do not have a root-restrictive layer in the series control section and formed in mixed alluvium. Craigsaddle soils are 100 to 150 cm to a densic contact. Millvilla soils are 50 to 100cm to a paralithic contact with metasedimentary rock and lack sandy loam or sandy clay loam textures in the argillic. Motherlode soils are 100 to 150 centimeters to a lithic contact with metavolcanic rock. Sierra soils are 100 to over 150 centimeters to a paralithic contact. Verjeles soils have 2Bt horizons with clay content ranging from 40 to 60 percent. Wardsferry soils are 100 to 150 cm to a paralithic contact with metasedimentary rock. Yellowlark soils are 100 to 150 centimeters to a duripan and formed in mixed alluvium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Flanly soils are on backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent. The soils formed from intrusive igneous rock, including granodiorite, diorite, and quartz diorite. Elevations are 235 meters to 750 meters. The climate is Mediterranean, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 600 to 1300 mm. The average January temperature is 8 degrees C.; the average July temperature is 25 degrees C; mean annual air temperature is 14 to 17 degrees C. The frost-free season is 235 to 260 days."
