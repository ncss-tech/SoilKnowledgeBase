  "OVERVIEW": "The Flanly series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material derived from intrusive igneous rocks, such as granodiorite, quartz diorite and diorite. Flanly soils are on hills and have slopes of 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
