  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the fly ash materials is generally more than 6 m thick.  Hues throughout are N/ , 10Y, 7.5YR or 10YR, value 2 to 6, and chroma 0 to 3. Textures include silt loam, loam and sandy loam. Coarse fragments of coal, slag, brick, glass and metals range from 0 to 30 percent.  Depletions, where present, occur immediately below the ^Au horizon. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe ^A horizon may be defined more on the abundance of roots than anything else. The structure is very fine granular or it is structureless. Organic carbon accumulation would be difficult to identify by morphology.\nThe ^C horizons have distinctly fewer roots than the ^A horizon, but otherwise look similar. It is structureless. Redoximorphic concentrations are common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fishkill soils are on nearly level to steep artificially created landforms in fill areas. These soils formed in fly ash that resulted from industrial burning of coal. Some areas may be covered with a thin cap of natural soil as a prevention of wind blowing. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1021 to 1325 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

Associated soils on different landscape positions include Hassock, Winhole and Flatland soils. Hassock, Winhole, and Flatland soils occur on higher landscape positions. Hassock soils have a water table at greater than 100 cm. Winhole soils have a water table between 60 and 100 cm. Flatland soils have a water table between 25 and 60 cm."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are generally densely covered with Common Reed. Other vegetation species includes mugwort, Golden Rod, Black locust, Tree of Heaven, Multiflora rose, Poison Ivy, Poplar, Black Cherry, Grey Birch, White Mulberry and Japanese knotweed. Planted species include Autumn Olive. Reclamation is unlikely because there is no natural terrestrial vegetation to restore, and the areas vegetate naturally after deposition ceases. These soils are used for recreational development and wildlife refuge."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Fishkill soils are mapped in the soil survey areas of the Gateway National Recreation Area and the initial survey areas of Kings and Queens Counties, NY. The soils are of minimal extent, however they are of unique importance to users of the soil surveys.\n1. Carbolith is a name coined at West Virginia University to describe dark colored sedimentary rocks that will make a black or very dark (Munsell color value of 3 or less) streak or powder. Rocks under this name include coal not scheduled for mining, impure waste coal, bone coal, high carbon siltstones, and high carbon shale.\n2. Fly ash supplies accumulated over more than one hundred years of time when hard coal was the main source of heating and producer of heat for production of electricity. The material often contains debris tossed into furnaces during burning.\n3. Particle size class control section characterization data from  pedon S99NY047005 used for this soil.\n4. Due to the recent deposit of this material and the low organic matter content normal redoximorphic processes have not progressed. The aquic conditions have been observed and are being used as the basis for the classification.\n5. CEC activity class is estimated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 cm ( ^Au horizon).\n2. Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average less than 35 percent by volume.\n3. Aquic conditions - the zone within 25 cm (^Au and ^Cu1 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: See Remarks.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
