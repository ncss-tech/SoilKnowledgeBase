  "OVERVIEW": "The Fergus series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or till.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
