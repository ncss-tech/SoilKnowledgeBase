    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 8 to 30 inches.  Depth to contrasting material in the substratum is more than 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam having a clay content which averages between 27 and 35 percent.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Structure ranges from moderate to strong prismatic which parts to strong or moderate angular or subangular blocks.  Peds have faint continuous or patchy clay films.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Carbonates are disseminated and in masses.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam alluvium, and less commonly stratified silty clay to very fine sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Farland soils are on level to moderately steep terraces, foot slopes of stream valleys and fans on uplands.  Slope gradients commonly average between 1 and 6 percent, but range from 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in stratified alluvium of mixed mineralogy.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 13 to 18 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."
