  "OVERVIEW": "The Farland series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium on terraces, valley foot slopes and fans on uplands.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam having a clay content which averages between 27 and 35 percent.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Structure ranges from moderate to strong prismatic which parts to strong or moderate angular or subangular blocks.  Peds have faint continuous or patchy clay films.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.
