  "OVERVIEW": "The Farland series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in stratified alluvium on terraces, valley foot slopes and fans on uplands.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam having a clay content which averages between 27 and 35 percent.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Structure ranges from moderate to strong prismatic which parts to strong or moderate angular or subangular blocks.  Peds have faint continuous or patchy clay films.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Carbonates are disseminated and in masses.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam alluvium, and less commonly stratified silty clay to very fine sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Slope gradients commonly average between 1 and 6 percent, but range from 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in stratified alluvium of mixed mineralogy.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 13 to 18 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."
