  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Fallager series consists of very shallow, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic rocks.  Fallager soils are in swales on strath terraces in Cascade foothills and fan terraces in the Sacramento valley.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, (660 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F, (17 degrees C).",

The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F, (17 to 18 degrees C).  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 40 percent clay and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Mineralogy is mixed.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the duripan and the surface of the soil from November through March.  Redoximorphic features such as oxidized iron and iron-manganese masses occur in the A, Bt and 2Bt horizons and iron-manganese capping 1 to 3 mm thick on top of the 3Bqm.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 5YR 6/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/3, 5/4 or 5YR 4/3.  Texture is loam, gravelly loam, cobbly loam, cobbly clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 30 percent. Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4, 5YR 4/3, 5/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4 or 7.5YR 4/3.  Texture is gravelly clay loam, clay loam, cobbly clay loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 40 percent.
