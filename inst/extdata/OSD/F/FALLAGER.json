    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to duripan is 4 to 10 inches, (10 to 25 cm) and is underlain by volcanic sediments or volcanic sandstone and tuff.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F, (17 to 18 degrees C).  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 40 percent clay and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Mineralogy is mixed.  A fluctuating water table can occur between the top of the duripan and the surface of the soil from November through March.  Redoximorphic features such as oxidized iron and iron-manganese masses occur in the A, Bt and 2Bt horizons and iron-manganese capping 1 to 3 mm thick on top of the 3Bqm.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 5YR 6/3.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/3, 5/4 or 5YR 4/3.  Texture is loam, gravelly loam, cobbly loam, cobbly clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 30 percent. Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4, 5YR 4/3, 5/4 or 6/6.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4 or 7.5YR 4/3.  Texture is gravelly clay loam, clay loam, cobbly clay loam or silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 40 percent.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt horizon dry color is 7.5YR 5/3, 5/4, 5YR 5/3 or 10YR 5/3.
