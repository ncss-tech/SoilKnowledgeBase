  "OVERVIEW": "The Flatbottom series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt on mountain slopes and headwalls.  Slopes are 60 to 100 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 155 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
