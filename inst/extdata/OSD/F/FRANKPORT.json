  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section contains greater than 85 percent dark colored sand of which 75 to 95 percent is medium sand and coarser. The sand is weathered from heavy minerals composed, in general, of over 50 percent chromite, illmenite, and magnetite.  It has a strong lithochromic influence on the color of the soil profile, particularly in the subsoil.  Thickness of the solum is 5 to 20 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.  Soil reaction is very strongly or strongly acid.  It is coarse sand or sand throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 moist and dry.  Organic matter is 1 to 5 percent.\nThe AC horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Organic matter is less than 0.5 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry,  and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is strongly to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Frankport soils are on old stabilized coastal sand dunes with undulating to hilly topography associated with adjacent marine terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in eolian sand derived dominantly from dark colored arkosic sediments eroded from the Klamath Mountains of southwestern Oregon.   Elevation is 0 to 600 feet. The climate is humid, characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 210 to 330 days."

Crofland, Cunniff, Ferrelo, Horseprairie, Huffling, and Klooqueh soils occur on adjacent marine terraces.  Crofland, Cunniff, Huffling, and Klooqueh soils have an argillic horizon.  Ferrelo and Horseprairie soils have an umbric epipedon greater than 10 inches thick and have cambic horizons.  Heceta and Yaquina soils occur on the deflation plain immediately behind the stabilized dunes.  Heceta soils are poorly drained.  Yaquina soils have a spodic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained.  Langlois soils occur on old tidal flats adjacent to the stabilized dunes and are poorly drained.  Netarts soils are on stabilized dunes and marine terraces immediately adjacent to active dunes and have a spodic horizon.  Winchuck soils occur on adjacent stream terraces and have an argillic horizon."

Native vegetation includes shore pine, Sitka spruce, Pacific madrone, Pacific waxmyrtle, tanoak, salal, evergreen huckleberry, hairy manzanita, bearberry, and Pacific rhododendron.  Douglas fir occurs in the more sheltered areas with  European beachgrass, American dunegrass and beachgrass, coyotebrush, and lupine occuring in the more exposed or recently stabilized areas."
