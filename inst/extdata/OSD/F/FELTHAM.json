  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 66 degrees to 73 degrees F. The soils are usually dry, but are moist between depths of 12 and 36 inches for 60 to 75 days in late winter and spring and are dry for 60 to 90 days in summer and autumn. Organic matter content is estimated to be 0.25 to 1.0 percent. The soil averages loamy fine sand or loamy sand in the 10- to 40-inch section. The depth to calcareous material commonly ranges from 15 to 35 inches but in some pedons lime is lacking.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist.\nThe C1 horizon has the same colors as the A horizon or is 1 unit of value lighter, and it ranges to 4 in chroma. The A and C1 horizons are noncalcareous and neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon contains less than 15 percent carbonate and commonly less than 10 percent and it is mildly to strongly alkaline."

Cashmere, Chedehap, Escalante, Lolalita, and Turbyfill soils are coarse-loamy in the control section. Also, Cashmere soils have a mollic epipedon and Chedehap soils have a cambic horizon.  Quincy and Toll soils have coarse textured control sections. containing no layer finer than loamy fine sand. Tindahay soils lack medium or moderately coarse textured layers below depths of 30 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils are on terraces and alluvial fans at elevations of 2,000 to 4,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent but are mostly less than 7 percent. The soils formed in alluvium which usually is wind modified, is dominantly from granitic or similar acid igneous rock sources, and contains some mafic material. The climate is middle-latitude steppe (Trewartha's modified Koppen System) with moist winters and dry summers. The mean annual temperature is 45 degrees to 51 degrees F. Average freeze-free period is 125 to 170 days and mean annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches including 0.5 to 2 feet of snowfall."
