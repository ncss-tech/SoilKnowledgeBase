  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Farrar series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in fine sandy loam eolian material and the underlying loam glacial till in uplands.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part of the solum and moderate in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 50 inches and corresponds to the depth to carbonates.  Thickness of material I ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  The most acid part of the profile is the A horizon and upper B horizon which are slightly or medium acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. In some pedons, a dark brown (10YR 3/3) BA horizon is present.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It commonly is fine sandy loam but layers of loamy fine sand less than 6 inches are in some pedons.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam with 18 to 24 percent clay.  The weighted average clay content of the control section ranges from 18 to 22 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Mottles with chroma of 1 to 8 are present below 30 inches in some pedons."

The Arbor, Aredale, Bode, Clarion, Cresken, Everly, Frontenac, Garmore, Kenyon, Liscomb, Moland, Ocheyedan, Ostrander, and Rossfield soils all have higher clay and lower sand content in the A and upper part of the B horizons.  Ankeny, Dickinson, Dunnville, Grogan, and Lomax soils are leached of carbonates to greater depths.  Ayr soils have argillic horizons and more clay in the B horizons."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 30 percent. They formed in about 2 feet of oxidized-leached fine sandy loam eolian material and oxidized-leached and unleached loam Wisconsin glacial till. Mean annual temperature ranges from about 45 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 30 to 32 inches."

Ankeny and Spillville soils are downslope on foot slopes and alluvial fans.  Spillville soils have thicker mollic epipedons and clay content of the B horizon exceeds 18 percent.  Clarion soils are on similar landscape positions.  Dickinson soils are on uplands at higher elevations. Storden soils typically are on the more sloping landscapes and have calcareous sola."
