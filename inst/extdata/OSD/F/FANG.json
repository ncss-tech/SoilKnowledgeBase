Ganaflan, Moepitz, Vanderhoff, Wetridge and Worland soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Geer soils have stratified loam, silt loam and very fine sandy loam control section, with 15 to 30 percent fine sand and coarser. Jeddito soils have soil temperature of 11 to 12 degrees C and do not contain volcanic or other pyroclastic material in the control section. Kumiva and Piltdown soils are not moist in the summer for 10 to 20 days and have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 12 degrees C. Marcou and Tooele soils do not contain any volcanic or other pyroclastic material in the control section. Mazuma soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days from July to September. Sodaspring soils do not usually get moist in lower part of moisture control section, at any time during the year and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Trachute soils have 7.5YR hues."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fang soils are on smooth or very slightly convex alluvial fans, inset fans, fan skirts and alluvial flats. They formed in loamy alluvium derived mainly from welded tuffs, basalt and limestone with a component of volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,430 to 1,620 meters. The climate is cool, and semiarid; mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C and the frost-free season ranges from 130 to 170 days."
