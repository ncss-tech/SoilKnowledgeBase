  "OVERVIEW": "The Fang series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks, including welded tuffs, basalt and limestone with a component of volcanic ash. Fang soils are on alluvial flats, fan skirts, and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Ganaflan, Moepitz, Vanderhoff, Wetridge and Worland soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Geer soils have stratified loam, silt loam and very fine sandy loam control section, with 15 to 30 percent fine sand and coarser. Jeddito soils have soil temperature of 11 to 12 degrees C and do not contain volcanic or other pyroclastic material in the control section. Kumiva and Piltdown soils are not moist in the summer for 10 to 20 days and have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 12 degrees C. Marcou and Tooele soils do not contain any volcanic or other pyroclastic material in the control section. Mazuma soils are not moist for 10 to 20 days from July to September. Sodaspring soils do not usually get moist in lower part of moisture control section, at any time during the year and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Trachute soils have 7.5YR hues."
