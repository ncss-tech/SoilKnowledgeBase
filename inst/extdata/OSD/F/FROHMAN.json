  "OVERVIEW": "The Frohman series consists of shallow to duripan, well drained soils that formed in silty lacustrine material and very gravelly alluvium of mixed origin.  Frohman soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry but are moist for more than 60 days during the winter season.  Depth to the duripan is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to very gravelly horizons is 20 to 40 inches.    Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons, this horizon may be weakly calcareous.\nThe Bqm horizon is silty and is indurated in the upper part.  The lower part ranges from weakly to strongly cemented.\nIn some pedons, the silty, friable 2C and 2Ck horizons below the upper duripan are lacking.  The underlying 2Ckqm very gravelly duripan is indurated or strongly cemented in the upper few inches becoming less cemented with increasing depth."

Arritola soils are fine-loamy above the duripan with 25 to 35 percent clay in the control section and lack the very gravelly horizons within a depth of 40 inches.  Chiara soils lack a cambic horizon and do not have a very gravelly layer within 40 inches. Coltroop soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 30 to 35 inches to basalt bedrock.  Crooked soils are sodic and are coarse-loamy above the duripan.  Minveno soils have a calcic horizon above a duripan.  Nevoyer soils are coarse-loamy and gravelly and are 9 to 20 inches deep to bedrock.  Otoole soils are sodic, calcareous throughout, and lack the very gravelly horizons above a depth of 40 inches.  Peeko soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Plegomir soils have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  Scoon soils contain 10 to 60 percent rock fragments in the Ck horizon above the duripan.  Tenvorrd soils lack a cambic horizon and have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Yahoo soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
