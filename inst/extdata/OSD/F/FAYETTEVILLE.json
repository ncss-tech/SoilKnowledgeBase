Series in closely related families are Anniston, Coronaca, Cumberland, Davidson, Decatur, Greenville, Lucedale, Nacogdoches, Red Bay, and Tadlock series.  Anniston, Davidson, Decatur, and Greenville soils are in a clayey particle size class, a kaolinitic mineralogy class and have lower base saturation.  Coronaca and Nacogdoches soils are in a fine particle size class and a kaolinitic mineralogy class.  Cumberland and Tadlock soils are in a fine particle size class and a mixed mineralogy class.  Lucedale and Red Bay soils are in a siliceous mineralogy class and have lower base saturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Fayetteville soils are on gently sloping to moderately sloping ridgetops and gently sloping to steep sideslopes in the Boston Mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 40 percent.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone bedrock with thin lenses of limestone and shale in places.  The mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches."

Enders soils, which are similar landscape positions are in a clayey particle size class and lower base saturation.  Linker soil, which occurs on broader ridgetops are less than 40 inches to hard bedrock and have lower base saturation.  Mountainburg soils, which occur higher on the sideslope are less than 20 inches deep to bedrock and have lower base saturation."
