  "OVERVIEW": "The Fairplay series consists of a very deep, very poorly drained, formed in alluvial/lacustrine calcareous marl sediments. Permeability is moderately slowly to slowly.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 50 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F. The Fairplay soils occur on nearly level active flood plains, and at the heads of limestone spring discharge areas in the Ridge and Valley province.",
