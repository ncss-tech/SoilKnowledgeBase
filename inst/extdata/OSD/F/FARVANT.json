  "OVERVIEW": "The Farvant series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed of residuum in colluvium from tuff.  The Farvant soils are on foothills and ridges.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes are 10 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
