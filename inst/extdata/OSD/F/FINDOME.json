  "OVERVIEW": "The Findome series consists of shallow to densic material, well drained soils formed in glacial till derived from granitic rocks. Findome soils are on ground moraines on mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
