  "OVERVIEW": "The Fenster series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from highly calcareous source materials and loess.  Fenster soils are on flood plains, footslopes, toeslopes, and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
