  "OVERVIEW": "The Ferver series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt and andesite.  Ferver soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
