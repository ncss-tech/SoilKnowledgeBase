  "OVERVIEW": "The Feethill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain and hill slopes.  These soils formed from granitic rocks.  Slopes range from 9 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
