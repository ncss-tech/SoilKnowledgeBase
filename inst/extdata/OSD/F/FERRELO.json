  "OVERVIEW": "The Ferrelo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately coarse-textured marine sediments overlying unconsolidated sandy material.  They are on dissected marine terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer months.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is usually loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam but some pedons have a thin overlay of loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  This horizon typically has one or two thin discontinuous dark reddish brown lenses that are firm or very firm and weakly cemented.  These may be lacking in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sand with 2 to 10 percent clay.  It is very firm and may range to weakly cemented below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ferrelo soils are on dissected marine terraces at elevations of 15 to 400 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  They formed in moderately coarse textured marine sediments overlying unconsolidated sandy material.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool, wet winters and cool, moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 90 inches.  The mean January temperature is 45 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 59 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 300 days.  Ferrelo soils occur on the Pioneer geomorphic surface."

Blacklock, Depoe, and Yaquina soils are poorly and somewhat poorly drained and have albic and spodic horizons.  Knappa and Templeton soils are in the fine-silty family.  Netarts soils have a thin albic horizon and fine sand spodic horizon. Frankport and Waldport soils lack a B horizon and are coarse textured.  Horseprairie soils are in the fine-loamy family."
