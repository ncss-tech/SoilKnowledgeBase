  "OVERVIEW": "The Fishpot series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 60 to 122 centimeters (24 to 48 inches) of human-transported material over buried alluvial or terrace soils. These soils are in river valleys on anthropogenic landforms in and near urbanized areas. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 1,050 millimeters (41 inches).",

Menfro and Winfield soils lack disturbed horizons. Associated soils on lower flood plain positions are the Blake, Booker, and Nevin soils. Blake soils are calcareous. Booker soils are in a very fine textural family. Nevin soils have chroma of 2 or less throughout the control section. Freeburg soils are also associated with the Fishpot soils.

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.40 to 14.00 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow or moderate. In some areas, Fishpot soils are subject to rare to frequent flooding for very brief to long periods. In other areas, the Fishpot soils are not subject to flooding due to a raise in elevation from the deposits of human-transported material."

The surface elevation was raised by deposits of human-transported material to reduce the risk of overflow. The amount of filling, cutting, and alteration of existing soil is variable from place to place."
