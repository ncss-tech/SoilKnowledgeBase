  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Fishpot soils are in river valleys on anthropogenic landforms in and near urbanized areas where human-transported materials have been placed over buried alluvial and terrace soils. The human-transported material contains human artifacts such as asphalt, brick, ceramic, cinders, glass, metal, and wood. Thickness of the human-transported material ranges from 60 to 122 centimeters, increasing the elevation of the landform. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11.1 to 13.9 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1,194 millimeters (37 to 47 inches). Frost-free period is 184 to 228 days. Elevation is 110 to 200 meters (360 to 655 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clarksville, Gasconade, Goss, Harvester, Menfro, and Winfield soils on higher upland positions. Clarksville and Goss soils have skeletal control sections. Gasconade soils are lithic. The moderately well drained Harvester soils are on higher positions. Menfro and Winfield soils lack disturbed horizons. Associated soils on lower flood plain positions are the Blake, Booker, and Nevin soils. Blake soils are calcareous. Booker soils are in a very fine textural family. Nevin soils have chroma of 2 or less throughout the control section. Freeburg soils are also associated with the Fishpot soils. Freeburg soils on higher positions on flood-plain steps."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 55 to 117 cm (22 to 46 inches) at some time between November and May in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.40 to 14.00 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderately slow or moderate. In some areas, Fishpot soils are subject to rare to frequent flooding for very brief to long periods. In other areas, the Fishpot soils are not subject to flooding due to a raise in elevation from the deposits of human-transported material."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nAnthropic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 30 centimeters (12 inches) (^Au1 and ^Au2 horizons).\nDepth to buried A horizon formed in alluvium: 67 centimeters (26 inches) (top of 2Aub horizon).\nDepth to aquic conditions: redox features in all buried horizons below a depth of 67 centimeters (26 inches).\nFishpot soils occur on stream terraces and flood plains that were altered as a result of urbanization. The surface elevation was raised by deposits of human-transported material to reduce the risk of overflow. The amount of filling, cutting, and alteration of existing soil is variable from place to place.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S2020MO189001) and for supporting pedons from the University of Missouri Soil Health Assessment Center, Columbia, MO.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
