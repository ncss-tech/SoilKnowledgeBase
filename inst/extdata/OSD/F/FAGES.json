In cultivated areas there is typically no evidence of structure remaining and the soil appears massive within clods.  A satellite pedon (S90CA-29-014) was sampled for laboratory characterization by the NSSL.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\nOchric epipedon -- 0 to 7 inches (Ap)\nCambic horizon -- 7 to 30 inches (Btnz, Bnyz)\nNatric subgroup -- The upper part of the cambic horizon (Btnz) has an SAR of 63.\nParticle size control section -- The zone from 10 to 40 inches"
