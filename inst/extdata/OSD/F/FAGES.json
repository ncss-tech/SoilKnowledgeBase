Cerini soils are on adjacent low alluvial fans, are fine-loamy, and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon.  Copus soils are in adjacent basins, have a mollic epipedon, and have an SAR of less than 13.  Lokern soils are in adjacent basins, have an irregular decrease in organic carbon, and have an SAR of less than 13.  Millox soils are on similar surfaces, have intersecting slickensides, and have segregated carbonates in the lower part of the B horizon.  Westhaven soils are on adjacent low alluvial fans, are fine-silty, and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Uncultivated areas of this soil have moderate to strong thick platy or medium to coarse subangular blocky structure in the A horizon.  In cultivated areas there is typically no evidence of structure remaining and the soil appears massive within clods.  A satellite pedon (S90CA-29-014) was sampled for laboratory characterization by the NSSL.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\nOchric epipedon -- 0 to 7 inches (Ap)\nCambic horizon -- 7 to 30 inches (Btnz, Bnyz)\nNatric subgroup -- The upper part of the cambic horizon (Btnz) has an SAR of 63.\nParticle size control section -- The zone from 10 to 40 inches\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
