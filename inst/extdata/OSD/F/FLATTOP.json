    "content": "TYPE LOCATION: Clark County, Nevada; approximately 2.3 miles north of U.  S. Highway 91 and 600 feet east of Elgin Road; about 700 feet west and 600 feet south of the NE corner of sec. 22, T.13S., R.68E.\nRange in Characteristics: Solum thickness is 16 to 25 inches.\nMean annual soil temperature is 60 to 68 F. These soils are usually dry, mainly during the spring, summer and autumn months.\nA 1- to 3-inch thick A1 horizon occurs around the base of shrubs. The Al horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 7 or 6 dry, 5 or 4 moist, chroma of 2 through 4.  It has few to many fine and medium vesicular pores.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist and 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 4 through 6.  It is dominantly clay loam, but includes sandy clay loam or loam. The average clay content of the argillic horizon is 18 to 30 percent and volume of coarse fragments is 35 to 50 percent. The exchangeable sodium percentage is 15 to 30 percent. Segregated lime occurs in the lower B2t or B3t horizons and fine salt and/or gypsum segregations occur in the B3t or C1 horizons of some pedons.\nThe solum rests unconformably over very gravelly sandy material containing 50 to 85 percent gravel.\nThese materials are weakly or strongly lime-cemented below 28 inches in most pedons. Individual cemented strata rarely exceed 14 inches in thickness and are as thin as 1 inch in Some pedons. pH usually ranges from 8.4 to 9.6, but can be as low as 8.0 where sufficient amounts of gypsum are present.\nCompeting Series and their Differentiae: These are the Casa Grande and Gothard soils which lack contrasting textures within their control sections and have fine-loamy control sections.\nSetting: Smooth, gently and moderately sloping alluvial fans at elevations of 1,600 to 2,600 feet. Slope gradients are 2 to 8 percent.  The surface is dissected by few shallow and occasional- deep channels.  Flattop soils formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. The climate is hot and arid with a mean annual temperature of 66 to 70 F., average January temperature of 45 to 47 F., and average July temperature of 82 to 85 F. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches.\nPrincipal Associated Soils: These are the Arizo, Crystal Springs, Mormon Mesa, and St. Thomas soils. Arizo soils have sandy-skeletal control sections. Crystal Springs and Mormon Mesa soils have lime-indurated horizons, and lack argillic horizons. St. Thomas soils have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches.\nUse and Vegetation: These soils are used for rangeland during the spring months when annuals abound. The vegetation consists of a very sparse stand of creosotebush, white bursage, cholla, yucca, and annuals.\nDistribution and Extent: These soils are of moderate extent in southern Nevada. They may also occur in adjacent southwestern Utah and possibly in southern Arizona.\nSeries Established: Clark County (Virgin River Area), Nevada, 1969.\nRemarks: Flattop soils were formerly classified as Red Desert soils.\nOSED scanned by NSSQA.  Last revised by state on 9/71. Responsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 4/2015.  ET\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
