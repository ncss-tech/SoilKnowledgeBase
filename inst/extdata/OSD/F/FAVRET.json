  "OVERVIEW": "The Favret series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from siliceous and volcanic rocks.  They are on mountain side slopes and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
