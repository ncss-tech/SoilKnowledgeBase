    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Rhyolitic tuff occurs at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The solum contains 60 to 80 percent vitric material in the silt, sand and gravel fractions.  Gravel fraction of the whole soil ranges from 5 to 35 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 52 degrees to 57 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in late May or June and remain dry until October.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 6/1, 6/2, or 6/3, 7/1 or 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4.  Dry colors of 4/2 or 5/2 and moist colors of 2/2 or 3/2 only occur in the upper 1 to 3 inches.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam or light loam and may be gravelly.  It is slightly to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4; 2.5Y 7/4, 8/2, or 8/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 6/4, 7/4, or 8/4.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or loam and may be gravelly.  It is slightly to very strongly acid.  Some pedons have an A or BA horizon transitional to the Bw horizon, or the BC horizon may be absent.\nThe C horizon, where present, is 10YR 7/1, 7/2, 7/3, 8/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2, 8/3, or 8/4.  Moist color is 10YR 5/3, 6/2, or 6/3 and has a lower chroma or yellower hue than the overlying Bw horizon.  It is slightly acid to very strongly acid."
