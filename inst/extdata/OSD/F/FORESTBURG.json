  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils formed in sandy materials overlying stratified drift or loam till at depths typically between 24 and 36 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Horizons with color value less than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist extend to depths of 20 to 40 inches, but the organic carbon content at depths greater than 20 inches is less than 0.6 percent.  Depth to carbonates typically is the same as the depth to the contrasting material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loamy fine sand, but is fine sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral. Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand and is neutral.\nMost pedons have a thin Bw2 or C horizon of sandy loam or loamy sand immediately above the 2Bk or 2C horizon.  Few or common, faint or distinct redox features and accumulations of carbonate are in some pedons.\nThe 2Bk and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are loam, clay loam, silt loam or stratified loam, silt loam and very fine sand.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Redox features are common or many and prominent or distinct.  Accumulations of carbonate range from few to many."

The coarse-loamy Blendon and Carthage soils and the Doger soils are on similar landscapes.  Doger soils do not have contrasting loamy materials within depth of 40 inches.  The fine-loamy Clarno, Ethan, Hand and Houdek soils are on ridges and knobs.  The somewhat poorly drained Elsmere soils and the poorly drained Fedora and Shue soils are in lower positions."
