    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick. These soils are noncalcareous to a depth of 60 inches or more. Bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Texture of the particle size control section is loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 5 percent rock fragments. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 37 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nA Bw or AC horizon is present in many pedons. When present, these horizons have hue, value, and chroma similar to the A and C horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Reaction is typically neutral or slightly alkaline but may range to moderately alkaline (pH 8.0 or less) in some pedons."

Auzqui soils are calcareous throughout and have moderately or strongly alkaline A and AC horizons. Redcloud and Thayne soils have horizons of carbonate accumulations. Bynum, Teton, and Wrenman soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Emerald and Tamp soils have over 15 percent rock fragments throughout the particle size control section. Tampico soils have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR throughout the control section and are hard or very hard in the Bw or C horizons. Tilton soils are calcareous and have inconsistent horizons of carbonate accumulation. Tilton soils also have reactions of 8.0 to 8.6 in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Uhl soils are on nearly to steep alluvial fans, fan aprons, and footslopes of hills and mountains. These soils formed in moderately fine alluvium washed from till and sedimentary beds. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. Elevations are 6,500 to 8,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and ranges from 15 to 22 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees and ranges from 34 to 39 degrees. The frost-free season is estimated to range from 55 to 85 days but frost may occur at any time."
