  "OVERVIEW": "The Upatad series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from rhyolite, andesite, and welded tuffs. The Upatad soils are on hills, and mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
