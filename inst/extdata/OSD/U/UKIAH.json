  "OVERVIEW": "The Ukiah series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from basalt and volcanic tuff.  Ukiah soils are on hills with slopes of 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The soils are dry during the four months following the summer solstice for 60 to 90 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 15 to 30 inches thick.  Depth to the paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil has cracks in the summer in most years that are at least 1 cm wide at a depth of 20 inches and that extend to the surface, or to the base of the Ap horizon if cultivated. Percentage of surface covered with stones ranges from about 0.1 to 15 percent.  The solum is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist in the upper part and 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist in the lower part.  Chroma is 2 or 3.  The Bt horizon has weak or moderate prismatic and strong or moderate blocky or subangular blocky structure.  It has 40 to 60 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent rock fragments.  It is silty clay, clay, cobbly clay or cobbly silty clay.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and dry.  It is loam or silty clay loam with 0 to 20 percent gravel and cobbles.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

The soils formed in colluvium from basalt and volcanic tuff. The surface is influenced by loess in some places.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 21 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F, and mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days."
