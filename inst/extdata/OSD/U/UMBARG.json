  "OVERVIEW": "The Umbarg series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in moderately fine textured alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Umbarg soils are on alluvial fans, low terraces, flood plains, and drainages that dissect uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Potential competitors that do not yet have CEA class assigned are the Draper, Frazwell, Humbarger, Lynx, Maskell, Pack, and Shanta series. Bon, Humbarger, Maskell, Merrick, and St. Onge soils are in a climatic setting that receives about 3/4 of their precipitation between April and September. In addition, these soils occur at low elevations and the Humbarger soils have mean annual temperature of greater than 54 degrees F.  Bon and St. Onge soils are moist in some parts of the moisture control section from May 15 to July 15. Draper, Frazwell, Lynx, Maskell, Merrick, and Pack soils are leached of carbonates to a depth of 30 inches or more. In addition, Frazwell soils have a buried horizon at 34 to more than 60 inches. Manzano soils have a Bw horizon and a consistent k horizon. Shanta soils have 5 to 20 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section."
