    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 13 to 24 inches.  Organic carbon ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the upper 4 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  When the moist value and chroma is as dark as 3/3, the horizon is too thin; if mixed to 7 inches, or if it is too light colored or contains too little organic carbon, it fails to qualify as a mollic epipedon.  Typically the horizon is loam or sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 25 percent.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically they are clay loam and clay, but the clay ranges from 35 to 45 percent clay, silt from 10 to 40 percent, and sand from 20 to 50 percent.  There is 15 percent of more fine sand and coarser.  They are neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  These horizons are typically clay loam, sandy clay loam, and loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 37 percent, silt from 10 to 60 percent, and sand from 30 to 70 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent pebbles.  Calcium carbonates range from 5 to 15 percent."

The mean annual precipitation is about 13 to 16 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.
