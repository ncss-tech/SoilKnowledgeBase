  "OVERVIEW": "The Ulen series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in sandy glaciolacustrine deposits on glacial lake plains. Permeability is rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 51 centimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
