Alamogordo soils are finer textured (very fine sandy loam and loam throughout). Borderline soils are on fan terraces and are not subject to flooding. Hobcan soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative during the summer and occur in the Mohave Desert.  Monahans soils are described as containing a range in clay of 18 to 30 percent in the control section.  Monzingo soils contain Cd horizons."

These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary formations.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December to February.  The mean annual air temperature is 60 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 190 to 280 days."
