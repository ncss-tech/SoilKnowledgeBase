  "OVERVIEW": "The Ugyp series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary formations.  Ugyp soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
