In areas that have been repeatedly burned, the hue is 10YR, values of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma 1 or 2 moist. The horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and is 5 to 50 percent pebble-size concretions. Reaction in 1:1 water is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe upper part of the B horizon has hue of hue of 10YR or 7.5 YR, value of 3, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 4, 6 or 8 moist; the lower part is mottled with hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 or 6 moist. The horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay. It is 5 to 35 percent pebble-size iron concretions. The reaction in 1:1 water ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid."
