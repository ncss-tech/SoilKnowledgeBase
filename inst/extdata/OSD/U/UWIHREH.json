It is pronounced oo.weh.reh (os like those in ooze, the es are pronounced like the e in wet, hs are silent).\nActual Lat/Long of profile not printed on the OSD by agreement with the Tuscarora Nation.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1) Mollic subgroup-meets the requirements for the mollic epipedon except thickness, after mixing the upper 18 cm. Zone from 0 to 6 inches (A horizon) and 1 inch of the B/E horizon.\n2) Argillic Horizon---the zone from 12 to 22 inches.\n3) Endoaqualfs great group---redoximorphic features in all layers between 25 and 40 cm, and 50 percent redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less on the faces of peds and redox concentrations in the top 12.5 cm of the argillic horizon. Endosaturation, and does not meet any of the stipulative criteria of any of the other great groups of Aqualfs.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
