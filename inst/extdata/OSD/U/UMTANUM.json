These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to the uppermost limit of the irrigation-induced water table is 30 to 48 inches. The upper 7 to 12 inches has a moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc; volcanic glass content of 7 to 20 percent, and Alox plus  Feox of 0.4 to 0.7 percent.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent. The particle-size control section has 35 to 45 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. B  Base saturation is more than 75 percent. The mollic epipedon is greater than 60 inches thick. These soils have an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3, dry and moist, and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist.
