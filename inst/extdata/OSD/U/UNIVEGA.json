  "OVERVIEW": "The Univega series consists of very shallow and shallow over an indurated duripan, well drained soils. The soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite and volcanic rocks. Univega soils are on fan piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
