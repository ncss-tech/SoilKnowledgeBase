  "OVERVIEW": "The Umikoa series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava flows.  Umikoa soils are on ash fields of mid elevation windward mountain slopes of Mauna Kea and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",

The soils are on all hillslope profile positions of undulating ash fields that overlie 11,000 to 300,000 year old lava flows.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 20 percent.   The soils formed in basic volcanic ash.  The mean annual rainfall is 1016 to 1524 millimeters (40 to 60 inches).  Cloudiness and fog are prevalent throughout the year.  Mean annual temperature is 14 to 16 degrees C (57 to 61 degrees F)."

Hanipoe soils occur at higher elevations and have mean annual soil temperature of 14 degrees C (57 degrees F) (isomesic soil temperature). Kemole soils are on narrow, rocky ridges that intersect Umikoa soils on 11,000 to 64,000 year old lava flows."
