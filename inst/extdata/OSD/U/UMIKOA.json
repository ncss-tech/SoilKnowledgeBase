The soils are on all hillslope profile positions of undulating ash fields that overlie 11,000 to 300,000 year old lava flows.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 20 percent.   The soils formed in basic volcanic ash.  The mean annual rainfall is 1016 to 1524 millimeters (40 to 60 inches).  Cloudiness and fog are prevalent throughout the year.  Mean annual temperature is 14 to 16 degrees C (57 to 61 degrees F)."

Maile soils occur at lower elevations and are typically moist throughout the profile and do not dry out for more than 90 cumulative days (udic soil moisture). Hanipoe soils occur at higher elevations and have mean annual soil temperature of 14 degrees C (57 degrees F) (isomesic soil temperature). Kemole soils are on narrow, rocky ridges that intersect Umikoa soils on 11,000 to 64,000 year old lava flows."

Natural vegetation includes koa (Acacia koa), mamane (Sophora chrysophylla), ulei (Osteomeles anthyllidifolia), and naio (Myoporum sandwicense)."
