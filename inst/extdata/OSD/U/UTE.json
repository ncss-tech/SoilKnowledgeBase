  "STATES": "CO,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ute series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in local alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  Ute soils are on alluvial fans, depressions on mesas, and drainageways of narrow mountain valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
