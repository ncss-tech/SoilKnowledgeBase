  "OVERVIEW": "The Uzacol series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from shale.  Uzacol soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
