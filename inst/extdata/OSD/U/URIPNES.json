The soil surface is covered with approximately 55 percent fine gravel.\nA--0 to 10 cm; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, slightly sticky and nonplastic; very few very fine roots; common fine interstitial and few fine tubular pores; 45 fine percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.6); clear wavy boundary. (10 to 23 cm thick)\nCr--10 to 53 cm; weathered granodiorite; some fine-earth soil is in fractures in the upper few inches.  (30 to 66 cm thick)\nR--53 cm; hard granodiorite."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture: Usually dry, moist for short periods in winter and spring, summer and autumn; typic aridic soil moisture regime.\nMeam annual soil temperature: 8 to 12 degrees C.\nDepth to bedrock: 10 to 36 cm to a paralithic contact. Unweathered, hard granitic bedrock is within 100 cm.\nReaction: Slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nOther features: Some pedons have secondary carbonate coats on the undersides of gravel in the lower part of the profile and also have moderately alkaline reaction. Some pedons have a thin C horizon above the paralithic contact with textures in the less than 2 mm fraction of sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 10 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, dominantly fine gravel with cobbles and stones common. Lithology of fragments is granitic rocks such as granite and granodiorite.\nA horizon\nValue: 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist.  When darker colors are present, they reflect the colors of the parent material.\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Uripnes soils are on hills and mountains. They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks and have a component of loess in some places.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,990 meters.  The climate is cool-arid, with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
