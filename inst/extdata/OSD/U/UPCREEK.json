These soils formed in mixed alluvium from volcaniclastic material.  The climate is cool and moist in winter and warm and dry in summer.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 410 mm but actual moisture received is greater due to landscape position.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees and frost-free period is 60 to 95 days."
