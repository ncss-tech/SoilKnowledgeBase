  "OVERVIEW": "The Upcreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from volcaniclastic material.  They are on stream terraces along creeks.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 410 mm but actual moisture received is greater due to landscape position.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees and frost-free period is 60 to 95 days."
