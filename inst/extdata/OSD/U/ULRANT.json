    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 13 inches thick.  Depth to hard granite bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges form 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees F.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and continuous horizons of carbonate accumulation ranges from 16 to 27 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Rock fragments, mainly small granitic pebbles, range from 0 to 15 percent.  It commonly is neutral but is slightly acid in some pedons.\nThe BA or AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or clay loam with 24 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent granitic pebbles.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It most commonly is gravelly clay loam and less commonly gravelly loam with 24 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 35 percent granitic pebbles.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 6 through 8 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is gravelly loam with 18 to 27 percent noncarbonate clay and 20 to 35 percent granitic pebbles.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  EC ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Farnuf soils are stratified throughout the C horizons and are nongravelly.  Felor soils have clayey sediment at 20 to 35 inches that contain 35 to 50 percent clay.  Greenway soils have firm consistence at 15 to 25 inches and are nongravelly throughout.  Hangdo soils lack free carbonates above 40 inches.
