  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 30 inches thick. Depth to the IIC horizon ranges from 20 to 30 inches. The horizon immediately above the IIC horizon is generally gravelly or very gravelly light sandy loam. The IIC horizon has voids larger than 1 mm.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer temperature ranges from 61 to 64 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 65 to 85 consecutive days during the late summer. Rock fragments consist of rounded quartzite and sandstone, and range from 25 to 60 percent in the A horizon and 50 to 75 percent in the IIC horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 4 dry, 1 through 3 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist. It ranges from loam or cobbly loam to gravelly loam or gravelly light sandy loam.  This horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline and 12 to 30 inches thick.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 6 moist. It ranges from very gravelly or very cobbly sand to loamy sand or very gravelly coarse sandy loam. This horizon is medium acid to mildly alkaline."
