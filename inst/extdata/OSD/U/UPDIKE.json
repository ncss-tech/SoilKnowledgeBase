Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,800 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C. The frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

The native vegetation is black greasewood, basin big sagebrush, basin wildrye, inland saltgrass, shadscale, bud sagebrush, and bottlebrush squirreltail.  Some areas are dominated by silver sagebrush and inland saltgrass."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 5 cm (A horizon).\nNatric horizon - The zone from 5 to 51 cm (Btn1, Btn2, and Btn3 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 125 and 175 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the C1 and C2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 5 to 51 cm (Btn1, Btn2, and Btn3 horizons).\nThe revision of November 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Fine, smectitic, mesic Typic Natrargids.  The Xerertic subgroup placement is based on the estimated linear extensibility (LE) as populated in the NASIS database and field evidence of reversible surface and trans-horizon cracks.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
