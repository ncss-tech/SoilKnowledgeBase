  "OVERVIEW": "The Updike series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Updike soils are on lake terraces and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

The Xerertic subgroup placement is based on the estimated linear extensibility (LE) as populated in the NASIS database and field evidence of reversible surface and trans-horizon cracks."
