This soil property was taken into consideration with the percent passing sieve No. 10 on the old soil interpretation record.  Appropriate adjustments have been made to this series description by eliminating references to soft shale fragments and related modifiers.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 cm (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 107 cm (Bt horizons)\nParalithic materials--the zone from 183 to 208 cm (Cr horizon)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 150 cm\nThis edit updates the 6/1999 Revision by AWD,WRK, ART\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nCharacterization data is available from the KSSL for the following pedons:\n1972PA003020, 1973PA019040\nFrom The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory:\nGR-001, HR-006, MG-2, MS-012, NB-045, WS-25\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
