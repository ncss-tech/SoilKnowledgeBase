  "OVERVIEW": "The Umberland series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Umberland soils are on lake plains, alluvial flats, and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
