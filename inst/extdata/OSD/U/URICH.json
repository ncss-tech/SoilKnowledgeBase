It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  The upper subhorizon may have value of 3.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages 27 to 35 percent clay."

Andry soils have surface layers of hemic materials and exchangeable sodium percentages of 8 percent or more.  Jeanerette soils contain free carbonates and are less acid.  Morey soils have warmer climate and more rainfall.  Muldrow and Quarles soils have more clay in the argillic horizon."
