    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 36 to 60 or more inches.  The mollic epipedon commonly is 10 to 20 inches thick, but may range to 24 inches.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or less.  The upper subhorizon may have value of 3.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages 27 to 35 percent clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Andry, Jeanerette, and Morey series of the same family and the Muldrow and Quarles series.  Andry soils have surface layers of hemic materials and exchangeable sodium percentages of 8 percent or more.  Jeanerette soils contain free carbonates and are less acid.  Morey soils have warmer climate and more rainfall.  Muldrow and Quarles soils have more clay in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Urich soils are on stream terraces.  They formed in silty alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 60 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Osage soils have more clay.  Verdigris soils have higher chroma.  All of these soils are on similar positions or lower and closer to the main drainage."
