  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Uawda soils are on plateaus and mountains.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder and toeslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,200 to 2,700 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Observed glass contents in these horizons are 67 and 57 percent in the fine sand fractions, respectively.\nClassification was changed 3/2017 from Ashy over clayey, glassy over smectitic, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls to Ashy-skeletal over clayey, glassy over smectitic, frigid Vitrandic Argixerolls.\nUser Pedon ID: 2007CA051008.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
