These consist of subangular, rounded or angular gravel or cobbles of crystalline rocks. The soil is very strongly acid through moderately acid throughout unless limed.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6. A horizons with value of 3 are 6 inches or less thick.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6 with hue of 5YR in some eroded areas.
