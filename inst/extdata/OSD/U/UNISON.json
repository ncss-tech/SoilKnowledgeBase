Content of rock fragments range from 0 to 50 percent in the A, Ap, E, BA, and BE   horizons, 0 to 35 percent in the Bt horizon and 0 to 75 percent in the BC and C horizons.  These consist of subangular, rounded or angular gravel or cobbles of crystalline rocks. The soil is very strongly acid through moderately acid throughout unless limed.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6. A horizons with value of 3 are 6 inches or less thick.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6 with hue of 5YR in some eroded areas.  Ap horizons with value of 3 are 6 iches or less thick.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Textures include silty clay loam, clay loam, and heavy silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  This horizon is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 8, chroma of 3 through 6.

Agnos, Boden, and Gassville soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. Braddock soils have red Bt horizons.  Buckhall, Buffstat, Christian, Clifton, Groseclose, Littlejoe, Lodi, Muse, Nantahala, Pervina, Quantico, Sequoia, Timberville, Trappist, and Warminister soils have rock fragments related to material other than acid or basic crystalline rocks.  Fairfax soils have a discontinuity of alluvium over residuum.  Howell and Monmouth soils have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y in the lower Bt."

Unison soils formed in colluvium and alluvium 3 to 6 feet thick derived from a mixture of basic rocks or basic and acidic crystalline rocks. Annual temperature ranges from 52 degrees F to 57 degrees F, and annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches."
