    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where lime has been added.  Content of rock fragments, mostly quartz gravel, ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A and E horizons and from 0 to 15 percent in the B and C horizons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have A horizons less than 5 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 1.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, sand or the gravelly counterparts of these textures.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or the gravelly counterparts of these textures.\nA thin EB or BE horizon is present in some pedons.  It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have hue of 5YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma 4 to 8.  Most pedons have few to common mottles in shades of brown, yellow and red.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has the same range in color as the upper part with few to many mottles in shades of brown, yellow, red or gray.  In some pedons, the lower part of the Bt horizon has no dominant matrix color and is mottled in shades of brown, red and gray.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay or clay.\nThe BC or CB horizon, present in some pedons, has the same range in color as the lower part of the Bt horizon.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy loam or loamy sand.\nThe C horizon is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, red or gray.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam and commonly has streaks or strata of coarser and finer textured material.  The 2C horizon, present in most pedons, ranges in color from white to red.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam and commonly has streaks or strata of coarser or finer textured material."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Baymeade, Blaney, Chipola, Chisolm, Coosaw, Garcon, Gomery, Kenansville, Remlik, Tenaha, Tomahawk and Valhalla series in the same family and the Ailey, Fuquay, Lucy and Wagram soils in closely related families.  Baymeade soils have organic masses in E/Bh horizons.  Blaney, Chipola and Kenansville soils do not have a perched water table within 6 feet of the soil surface.  Chisolm soils have an apparent seasonal water table at a depth of 3 to 5 feet of the soil surface.  Coosaw and Garcon soils are somewhat poorly drained and have an apparent seasonal water table within 3 feet of the soil surface.  Ailey, Fuquay, Lucy, and Wagram soils have a kandic horizon.  In addition, Ailey soils have Btx horizons with 10 to 40 percent hard masses in the matrix, Fuquay soils have more than 5 percent plinthite within 60 inches of the surface, and Lucy and Wagram soils do not have a 20 percent decrease in clay content within 60 inches of the surface.  Gomery and Tenaha soils are underlain by soft sandstone bedrock.  Remlik soils have common lamellae in the C horizon.  Tomahawk soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a Bh horizon.  Valhalla soils have buried E and Bt horizons with sand or fine sand texture."
