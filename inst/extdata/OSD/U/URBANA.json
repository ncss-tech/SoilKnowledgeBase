  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to bedrock from 40 to 72 inches.  Rock fragments of schist range from 1 to 10 percent in the A horizon, 3 to 25 percent in the B horizon and 35 to 90 percent in the C horizon.  Rock fragments larger than 3 inches range from 0 to 5 percent in the B horizon and from 20 to 50 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4 with chroma of 4 and value of 6 confined to the E horizon in undisturbed pedons.  The A horizon is silt loam in the fine earth fraction.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has mottles of 2 or lower chroma within 10 inches of the upper boundary.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam, with clay content of 20 to 30 percent.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and from medium to slightly acid in the lower part.\nThe C horizon is normally a variegated dense mass of weathered\nschist fragments.  The fine earth fraction is channery to extremely channery silt loam.  It ranges from slightly firm to extremely firm and is not uniformly brittle.  It is medium or slightly acid.\nCOMPETING SERIES  These are the Albrights, Amwell, Canfield, Rittman, Sciotoville, Titusville, and Turbotville series and the Clarksburg, Comly, and Glenville series.  Albrights, Canfield, Sciotoville, Titus- ville, and Turbotville soils have sola thicker than 40 inches.  Amwell soils have coarse fragments derived from basic igneous rocks.  Rittman soils have coarse fragments dominated by sandstone and a few erratics.  Clarksburg and Comly soils do not have mottles of 2 or lower chroma in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Glenville soils have less than 35 percent base saturation."

Slopes are smooth and simple and are most commonly less than 10 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in residuum from actinolite, sericite and related fine-grained schistose rocks that are compara- tively high in bases.  The climate is temperate and humid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches."

Cardiff soils are skeletal and do not have an argillic horizon.  Chester, Glenelg, Linganore, and Manor soils are well drained and do not have fragipans.  Mt. Airy soils have bedrock within 40 inches and are skeletal.  These soils on similar topographic positions as the Urbana soils or are on slightly higher positions.  Glenville soils are on similar topographic positions as the Urbana soils but have less than 35 percent base saturation."
