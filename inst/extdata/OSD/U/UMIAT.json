The Copper River soils have calcareous fine silty substrata.  The Deborah soils are formed in gravelly sandy loam materials.  The Kugrug soils consist of gravelly silt loam materials.  The Kuslina soils are stratified.  The Saulich soils are formed in silt loam materials with a high proportion of mica.  The Kuskokwim soils are acid.  The Medfra soils have high chromas in the control section and are acid.  The Easley soils are calcareous.  The Shivugak soils have no histic epipedon.  The Tanana soils lack a histic epipedon and are high in mica.  The Tupuknuk soils lack a histic epipedon and are acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Umiat soils occur on nearly level to steep slopes in areas with continuous or nearly continuous permafrost.  The silty material is commonly underlain by sedimentary rock, which outcrops in places.  Polygons are common.  The climate is arctic, with long cold winters and short cool summers.  Precipitation is less than 10 inches annually.  Mean annual temperatures are less than 20 degrees F."
