Derringer and Erakatak soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  McIvey and Swanpeak soils have mollic epipedons that do not include subhorizons of the argillic horizon and they are not intermittently moist in some part above the moisture control section between July and September due to summer convection storms.  Threek soils have horizons with secondary silica within 40 inches of the soil surface and they are not intermittently moist in some part above the moisture control section between July and September due to summer convection storms.  Wilpar soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Yago soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates within 60 inches of the soil surface, are dominated by stones or cobbles in the particle-size control section, and they are not intermittently moist in some part above the moisture control section between July and September due to summer convection storms.  Yeates Hollow soils are deep to lithic contacts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Urwil soils are on pediments.  These soils formed in alluvium and residuum derived from rhyodacitic tuff.  Small, occasional rock outcrops occur in the landscape.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 6,800 to 7,400 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with most of it coming as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
