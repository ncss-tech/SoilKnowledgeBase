The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR (can be 7.5YR where eroded), value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Where the value of the A or Ap horizon is 3 and chroma is 3 or less moist, dry value is 6 or more. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 8. Chroma is as low as 2 in the layer immediately above the 2Bt horizon. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues. It has from 0 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bt or 3Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.

Aaron soils do not have a discontinuity in the Bt horizon. Alsup, Derinda, Goodson, and Morrisville soils have a paralithic contact from 40 to 60 inches. In addition, Goodson soils have mollic colors in the surface layer and Morrisville soils have free carbonates at 10 to 30 inches.  Losantville soils have free carbonates from 8 to 20 inches. Shircliff soils have free carbonates from 18 to 40 inches and are very deep to a lithic or paralithic contact.  Brookside, Ebal, Skrainka, and Vincent soils are very deep to a lithic or paralithic contact."

Slope gradients are 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in loess and the underlying clayey materials or residuum from dolomite.  Average annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and average annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 42 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Useful soils were formerly mapped as Bucklick soils, moderately wet, but revision of Soil Taxonomy to include Oxyaquic subgroups dictated reclassification of these soils.  The series pedon was selected from an eroded unit because of preponderant acreage.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to about 7 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 7 inches to 53 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, and 2Bt/Cr horizons);\nlithic feature - hard bedrock contact at 53 inches;\noxyaquic feature - a perched water table in the lower part of the argillic horizon causes oxyaquic conditions.\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of Missouri Soil Characterization Lab Number M92-151-08.\nNASIS pedon number 95MO151013.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
