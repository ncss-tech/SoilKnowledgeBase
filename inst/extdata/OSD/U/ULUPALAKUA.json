Io soils have weak or moderate structure throughout and lack gelatin-like coatings on peds in the B horizon.  Kainaliu soils have weak or moderate structure in the B horizon, are 20 to 40 inches deep over fragmental Aa lava and have mean annual soil temperature of 72 degrees F.  Kamaoa soils have weak structure in the B horizon, lack gelatin-like coatings on peds in the B horizon, and have medial control sections.  Kikoni soils have a massive upper B horizon, lack gelatin-like coatings on peds in the B horizon and have a medial control section.  Kula soils have weak structure in the A horizon, a buried B horizon and a medial control section.  Palapalai soils have weak structure and are weakly smeary in the B horizon, and have an ashy control section.  Waimea soils have weak structure or are massive in the B horizon and have a medial control section."
