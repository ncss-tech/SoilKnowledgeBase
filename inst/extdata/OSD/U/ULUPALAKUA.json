  "OVERVIEW": "The Ulupalakua series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash and cinders.  Ulupalakua soils are on uplands and have slopes of 7 to 25 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 35 inches and mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

Kamaoa soils have weak structure in the B horizon, lack gelatin-like coatings on peds in the B horizon, and have medial control sections.  Kikoni soils have a massive upper B horizon, lack gelatin-like coatings on peds in the B horizon and have a medial control section.  Kula soils have weak structure in the A horizon, a buried B horizon and a medial control section.  Palapalai soils have weak structure and are weakly smeary in the B horizon, and have an ashy control section.  Waimea soils have weak structure or are massive in the B horizon and have a medial control section."
