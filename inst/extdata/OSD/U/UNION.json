  "OVERVIEW": "The Union series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a layer of loess that contains a fragipan and in the underlying clayey residuum weathered from cherty limestone or cherty dolomite.  In some pedons, the clayey residuum is partially derived from components of sandstone and acid shale.  These soils have moderate permeability in the upper part and slow permeability in the fragipan.  They are on upland ridgetops and backslopes with slopes ranging from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

They formed in 26 to 36 inches of loess underlain by clayey residuum weathered from cherty limestone or cherty dolomite. In some pedons, the clayey residuum is partially derived from components of sandstone, acid shale or unconsolidated Pennsylvanian deposits.  The contact of the contrasting material is marked by a cherty old erosional surface in which the fragipan has developed.  The fragipan is underlain by clayey cherty residuum or sediments.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 48 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 54 degrees to 57 degrees F."
