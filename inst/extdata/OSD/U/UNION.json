Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is strongly acid to neural.\nThe E or BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, rarely 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons have a matrix chroma of 2 in the layer immediately above the fragipan.  The average clay content ranges from 35 to 42 percent, but individual horizons may exceed 42 percent.  Chert gravel commonly is lacking but ranges up to 15 percent in the horizon immediately above the fragipan.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or their gravelly or cobbly to extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly analogues.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 65 percent with individual bands ranging to 80 percent.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe 3Bt or 4Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay or their gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 70 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Union soils occupy gently to moderately steep upland positions with slopes of 2 to 25 percent.  They formed in 26 to 36 inches of loess underlain by clayey residuum weathered from cherty limestone or cherty dolomite. In some pedons, the clayey residuum is partially derived from components of sandstone, acid shale or unconsolidated Pennsylvanian deposits.  The contact of the contrasting material is marked by a cherty old erosional surface in which the fragipan has developed.  The fragipan is underlain by clayey cherty residuum or sediments.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 48 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 54 degrees to 57 degrees F."
