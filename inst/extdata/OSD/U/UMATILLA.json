  "OVERVIEW": "The Umatilla series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and basalt colluvium mixed with small amounts of volcanic ash.  Umatilla soils are on uplands and have slopes of 15 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  Depth to basalt is 60 inches or more.   Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 65 percent rock fragments and 25 to 35 percent clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 when dry and chroma of 2 or 3 when moist and dry.  It has 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel. Volcanic glass content - 5 to 20 percent (estimated)\nAcid-oxalate extractable Al + 1/2 Fe - 0.4 to 1.0 percent (estimated)\nMoist bulk density - 1.0 to 1.2 g/cc (estimated)\nThe upper part of the 2Bw horizon when present has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, chroma of 2 or 3 when moist and 2 to 4 when dry.
