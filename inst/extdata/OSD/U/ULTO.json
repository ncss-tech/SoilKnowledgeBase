  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness is variable but typically ranges from 40 to about 60 inches.  Clay content in the control section averages 20 to 35 percent.  The base saturation ranges from 35 to 60 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  In most pedons iron-manganese concretions and/or masses range from few to about 5 percent.  They are mainly in the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  The texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 6 or 8.  Redox concentrations in shades of red or brown range from none to common. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam in the upper part and sandy clay loam or clay loam in the lower part.  Yellowish and brownish weathered glauconitic materials range from none to common and typically increase with depth.  Some pedons have discontinuous ironstone or glauconitic ironstone layers 1/2 to 2 inches thick in the lower part.   Some pedons have few to common ironstone fragments that are mainly less than 10 inches across the long axis.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe BCt horizon has colors mainly in shades of red with hue of 2.5YR and 5YR, value 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Spots of weathered glauconitic materials in shades of brown or yellow range from common to many.  Thin grayish discontinuous shale strata range from none to about 5 percent.  Texture is mainly fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have horizontally oriented glauconitic ironstone layers that are typically discontinuous and less than 2 inches thick.  Ironstone fragments typically less than 10 inches across range from few to common in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe C horizon is stratified weakly consolidated sandstone in shades of brown or red, grayish shale and weathered glauconitic materials in shades of brown and yellow. Fractured discontinuous strata of glauconitic ironstone and sandstone are common in most pedons.  The dominant texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam with or without spots and strata of clay loam or clay.  Roots penetrate the material but are concentrated along fractures in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Kenefick, Kenn, Romia and Speer series in the same family and the Alto, Liddieville, Redsprings and Toine series in similar families.  Kenefick, Kenn and Speer soils lack weathered glauconitic materials in the lower Bt horizons.  Romia soils have sandstone bedrock within 40 to 60 inches of the surface.  Alto soils have  base saturation greater than 60 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  Liddieville and Toine soils have mixed mineralogy.  Redsprings soils have clayey control sections with colors in hue of 2.5YR or redder."

The soil formed in stratified loamy marine sediments high in glauconitic materials typically in the Reklaw formation of the Claiborne Group.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 42 to 47 inches.  The average annual temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degrees F. and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 68 to 76.  The elevation ranges from 320 to 430 feet above sea level; frost free days range from 235 to 258."
