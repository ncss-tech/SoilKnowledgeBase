Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: an ochric epipedon from the mineral soil surface to 7 inches (E, Bw horizons); an albic horizon from the mineral soil surface to 4 inches (E horizon); an ash influenced layer from 2 to 15 inches (E, Bw horizon); a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches (Bw, 2C1 horizons).  Upsata soils have a cryic temperature regime and a udic moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data--S70 MONT-32-11.\nThe 3/2008 description reflects a change in classification from Sandy-skeletal, mixed Andic Eutrocryepts to Sandy-skeletal, mixed Andic Haplocryepts due to revision of the cryepts great groups and subgroups. The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
