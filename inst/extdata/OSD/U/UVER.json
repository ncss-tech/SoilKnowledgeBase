  "OVERVIEW": "The Uver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in  alluvium derived from quartzite and sandstone.  Uver soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 1 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
