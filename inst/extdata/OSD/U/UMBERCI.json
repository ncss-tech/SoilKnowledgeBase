(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted. When described on October 27, 2005 the soil was moist throughout.) The surface is covered by 74 percent gravel, 15 percent cobbles, 5 percent stones, and 1 percent boulders.\nA--0 to 1 centimeters (0 to 0.5 inch); pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; weak thin platy structure; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine roots throughout; few very fine tubular pores; 35 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles and 1 percent stones; strongly effervescent; moderately alkaline (pH 8.2); diffuse smooth boundary. (1 to 4 centimeters thick)\nBkq--1 to 13 centimeters (0.5 to 5 inches); pale brown (10YR 6/3) very gravelly fine sandy loam, dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) moist; massive; soft, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; common very fine and fine roots throughout; few very fine vesicular pores; 3 percent fine, distinct, irregular, very weakly cemented, very pale brown (10YR 7/3), dry, carbonate masses with clear boundaries on bottom of rock fragments; 3 percent, distinct, very pale brown (10YR 7/3) silica on the bottom of rock fragments; 45 percent gravel and 1 percent cobbles; violently effervescent (65 percent calcium carbonate equivalent); moderately alkaline (pH 8.4); abrupt irregular boundary. (10 to 22 centimeters thick)\nR--13 centimeters (5 inches); 1 to 5 centimeters thick highly fractured limestone with few fine roots (fractures are greater than 10 centimeters apart) above indurated limestone bedrock."

Birdspring and St. Thomas soils have 50 to 70 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and Birdspring soils are moist for less than 10 to 20 days cumulative following summer convection storms. Dozer soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and have a climate typical of the Chihuahuan desert. Mariscal soils are channery or flaggy. Saguaro soils are moist in some part of the particle size control section for more than 20 days cumulative from June through August and have a climate typical of the Sonoran desert."
