  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Umberci series consists of very shallow to bedrock, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Umberci soils are on mountains and hills. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 140 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 16.5 degrees C.",

Dozer soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and have a climate typical of the Chihuahuan desert. Mariscal soils are channery or flaggy. Saguaro soils are moist in some part of the particle size control section for more than 20 days cumulative from June through August and have a climate typical of the Sonoran desert."
