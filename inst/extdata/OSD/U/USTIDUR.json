  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ustidur soils are on partial ballenas. These soils formed in alluvium from metamorphic rock. Slope ranges from 8 to 30 percent. Elevations are 4,000 to 5,300 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches; mean annual temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 180 to 240 days."
