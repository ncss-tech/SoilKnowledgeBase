    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ubank soils are on fan terraces of undulating plateaus and mesas at elevations of 4,800 to 6,500 feet.  These soils formed in mixed calcareous alluvium from sandstone, mudstone, siltstone, and limestone with some influence from quartzite, basalt, and cinders.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 165 days."
