  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the upper solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The depth to carbonates ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  The upper solum is slightly acid or moderately acid; the lower part of the 2Bt horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Gravel and cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the profile.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Undisturbed pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2 and is 1 to 4 inches thick.  The A horizons are sandy loam, silt loam, or loamy sand.\nSome pedons have an E horizon underlying the Ap or A horizons.  It has hue of 10YR or 5YR; value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 or 3 and is 1 to 6 inches thick.  The E horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loamy sand.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  In some pedons, it is firm and brittle and has characteristics of a weak fragipan.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abbaye, Alcona, Cheboygan, Goodman, Padus, Sarona and Trenary soils in the same family and the Emmet, Isabella, Manistee, Menominee and Owosso series. Abbaye soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches.  Alcona soils are stratified and have coarser textured substrata. Cheboygan and Trenary soils contain less clay and silt in the argillic horizon and substratum. Goodman and Sarona soils have less clay and silt in the argillic horizon and substratum and have more acid substratums.  Padus soils have lower sola formed in sand and gravel.  Emmet soils do not have spodic horizons and have coarser textured lower sola and substrata.  Isabella soils are fine-loamy.  Manistee and Menominee soils have sandy upper sola.  In addition, Menominee soils contain less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand in the argillic horizon.  Owosso soils do not have spodic horizons and are mesic."

A large part on the steeper slopes is in forest, permanent pasture or is idle cropland. The native vegetation was mixed hardwoods, chiefly sugar maple, white ash, and American beech, with some eastern white pine."
