  "OVERVIEW": "The Udecide soils consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or residuum derived from weakly consolidated siltstone, loamstone, and sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, interfluves, hills, knolls, escarpments, strath terraces and sedimentary plains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
