  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum exceeds 60 inches in thickness.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, except where the surface layer has been limed.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  Some pedons have a very thin A horizon which has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay.  Some pedons have an overwash of material of coarser texture that is less than 10 inches thick.\nThe Bg1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4, or it has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles, if present, are few to many in shades of gray, brown, and yellow.  The lower part of the Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; it has few to many mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow or gray.  The Bg horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The particle size control section, the 10- to 40-inch section, has from 35 to 55 percent clay.  A few patches of oriented clay are in pores and cracks.  Black and brown concretions are from few to common throughout."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Closely related soils are the Alligator, Arkabutla, Belden, Houlka, Jackport, Leeper, Marietta, Mathiston, Trinity, Tuscumbia, and Una series.  Alligator, Houlka, Leeper, and Tuscumbia shrink and swell appreciably when their moisture content changes and are Vertic Haplaquepts.  Also, Alligator and Tuscumbia soils have value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 in more than 60 percent of the matrix in all subhorizons between a depth 10 and 30 inches; Alligator soils are very-fine in the particle size control section; Alligator and Leeper soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy; and Leeper soils are medium acid to moderately alkaline.  Arkabutla, Belden, and Mathiston have an organic carbon content that decreases irregularly with depth and are Aeric Fluvaquents; also, they are fine silty in the particle size control section.  Jackport soils, which have an argillic horizon and are Vertic Ochraqualfs, are very-fine in the particle size control section and have montmorillonitic mineralogy. Marietta soils are Fluvaquentic Eutrochrepts, and, in addition, they are fine-loamy in the particle size control section, have siliceous mineralogy, and are medium acid to mildly alkaline.  Trinity soils are Typic Pelluderts and, in addition, they have a mollic epipedon that is more than 24 inches thick, and they are calcareous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Urbo soils are on flood plains of streams that drain areas of the Southern Coastal Plain and the Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Areas.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium.  These are nearly level to gently sloping soils.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Near the type location the mean annual precipitation is 48 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees Fahrenheit."

In wet seasons late in winter and early in spring, the water table is at a depth of 1 to 2 feet and most areas of Urbo soils are subject to either occasional or frequent flooding of brief to long duration."
