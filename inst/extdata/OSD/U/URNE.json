  "OVERVIEW": "The Urne series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to sandstone.  These soils formed in loamy residuum from the underlying glauconitic sandstone or in loamy slope alluvium and in residuum. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the solum and ranges from slow to moderate in the sandstone.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon and to the paralithic contact with sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The upper part of the soil typically has few or no coarse fragments but the volume of sandstone channers ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Where moist value is 3, dry value is greater than 5.5 in the Ap.  The A or Ap horizon is typically fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam, but in same pedons it is loamy fine sand.  Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has texture and reaction like the A horizon described above.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or 5G; value of 3 to 8; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is typically fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam, but in some pedons it is loam or sandy loam and in some it is the channery analogs of these textures.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of loamy sand, sandy clay loam, or loamy fine sand or the channery analogs.  Clay content in the particle size control section averages less than 18 percent. Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.\nGrains of glauconite with hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 3 (or a color of 5G 4/2 or 5/2) are in the Bw or Cr horizon or both in many pedons.  Glauconite grains dominate some strata in some pedons and their color is the matrix color of those strata.\nThe Cr horizon consists of fine grained glauconitic sandstone."

Herkimer, Lowville, Pittsfield and Stockbridge soils do not have a paralithic contact with sandstone within a depth of 60 inches or more.  Marshill soils have a paralithic contact with magmatitic gneiss at a depth of 40 to 60 inches; have magmatitic gneiss gravel in the particle-size control section; and do not have glauconite in the particle-size control section.  Reger soils do not have glauconite in the control section and have mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches that ranges from 52 to 59 degrees F. Walnut soils have magmatitic gneiss gravel in the control section and do not have glauconite or sandstone channers in the control section."

Urne soils formed in loamy residuum from the underlying fine grained glauconitic sandstone(typically the Tunnel City sandstone that is identified, in part by it's high content of glauconitic minerals)  or in loamy slope alluvium and in residuum.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.
