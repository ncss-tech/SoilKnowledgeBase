  "OVERVIEW": "The Unius series consists of shallow over strongly cemented duripan, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from volcanic and sedimentary rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The Unius soils are on fan piedmont remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
