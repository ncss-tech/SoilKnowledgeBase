Scalade soils contain 5 to 18 percent clay.  Shabliss soils are noneffervescent above the duripan and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Trio soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm.  Truvar soils are noncalcareous above the duripan and have soil temperature of 11 to 15 degrees C."
