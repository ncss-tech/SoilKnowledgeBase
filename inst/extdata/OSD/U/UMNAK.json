  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil consists of layered silty and sandy volcanic materials, commonly with thin layers of cinders.  The strata vary from place to place in thickness and arrangement.  In former or existing flood plains or alluvial fans, the material may have been subject to water sorting.  Between depths of 10 and 40 inches, material with thixotropic properties makes up 1/4 to 1/2 of the soil.  Colors throughout the soil are in hues of 5YR to 10YR, and have values of 2 or 3 and chromas of 1 or 2."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Pustoi series of the same family, and the Aslik, Okmok, and Tulik series.  The Pustoi soils have sandy substrata with few or no thixotropic layers.  The Aslik soils have cindery substrata.  The Okmok soils are cindery and have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Tulik soils are stratified and consist dominantly of thixotropic materials."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Umnak soils occupy nearly level to steep hills, terraces, and alluvial fans in the vicinity of active volcanos.  They are formed in pyroclastic materials and are subject to occasional depositions of fresh ash or cinders.  The climate is maritime, with cool summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 to 65 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.; the mean January air temperature is about 33 degrees F.; the mean July air temperature is about 52 degrees F.; the average growing season is about 145 days."
