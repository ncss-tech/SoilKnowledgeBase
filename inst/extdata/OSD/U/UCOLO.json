  "OVERVIEW": "The Ucolo series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from shale. Ucolo soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
