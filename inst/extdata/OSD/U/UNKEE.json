  "OVERVIEW": "The Unkee series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  They are in playas.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
