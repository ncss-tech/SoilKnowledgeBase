  "OVERVIEW": "The Upsteer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium derived mainly from tuff.  The Upsteer soils are on sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
