  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Usal soils are on hill slopes adjacent to the Pacific coast.  Slopes are 30 to 99 percent.  The soils occupy a transitional position between the Mollisols on coastal grassland terraces to the west and the Ultisols and Alfisols on uplands to the east.  Elevations are 3 to 245 meters (10 to 800 feet).  The soils formed in material weathered from sandstone and mudstone.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual ranges of temperature.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1000 to 1500 millimeters (40 to 60 inches).  Mean January temperature is 10 degrees C (50 degrees F); mean July temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).  The frost-free period is 290 to 365 days."

Dehaven and Hotel soils formed from slightly harder sandstone and have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Irmulco soils are greater than 100 centimeters deep to lithic material.  Tramway soils lack a mollic epipedon."
