  "STATES": "CA,NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Upspring series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from extrusive basic igneous rocks and some pyroclastic material. Upspring soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus and have slopes of 8 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F.",

About 45 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones cover the surface.\nA1--0 to 1 inch; light gray (10YR 7/2) very stony loam, dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) moist; weak fine granular structure; slightly hard, very friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; few fine roots; common very fine tubular and interstitial pores; 45 percent pebbles, 10 percent cobbles, and 15 percent stones (mostly on the surface); strongly effervescent, disseminated lime; moderately alkaline (pH 8.0); abrupt smooth boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact of hard basalt ranges from 4 to 14 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 68 degrees F.  The soil contains small amounts of amorphous material from pyroclastic volcanic rocks.  Clay averages 10 to 18 percent from the surface to lithic contact.  These soils are dry from June through November for about 180 days.  The soil temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F. from about March to January for about 300 days.  The soils is intermittently moist from January through May but never moist for 90 consecutive days.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 7/2 and 7/3 and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  It is very gravelly to very stony sandy loam and averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. Texture is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly fine sandy loam."

Akela soils are moist during the summer from thunder storms.  Beach have hue of 2.5YR and 5YR, and contain mainly sandstone fragments.    Haleburu and Razorback soils are moist 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October.  Hindu and Hulda soils are moist more than 20 days cumulative between July and September. Noble Pass soils have 60 to 85 percent rock fragments, mainly pebbles. Tecopa soils lack an influence of amorphous materials from pyroclastic sources and have formed in materials weathered from quartzite, schist, and gneiss."
