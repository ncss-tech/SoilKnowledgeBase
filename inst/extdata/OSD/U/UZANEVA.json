Minor additions of eolian material derived from sandstone are present in the upper horizons.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,700 to 5,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 170 days."

Gotho soils are fine-loamy, do not have high shrink-swell properties, and occur on adjacent hummocks.  Shumbegay soils are sandy, do not have natric horizons, and occur on adjacent stable dunes.  Escavada soils are sandy and nonsodic."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series was proposed by New Mexico.  Arizona retains responsibility.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 1 inch (A horizon)\nNatric horizon - The zone from 1 to 25 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btn horizons)\nHaplic subgroup - The presence of a natric horizon with a sodium adsorption ratio that is less than 13 in 50 percent or more of the horizon thickness.  (Bt1 and Bt2 = 12 inches total with SAR <13; Btn = 12 inches with SAR >13)\nThis soil has high shrink-swell properties in the natric horizon and morphological features that are marginal to those required for the Vertic subgroup of Natrargids.  Cracks are present in the natric horizon that are generally 5 mm or more wide, but slickensides or wedge-shaped aggregates are not present.  This soil may qualify for the Vertic subgroup under the linear extensibility (LE) criteria, but it has not had the COLE determined for the horizons above 40 inches.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Sodium adsorption ratio values were determined for the horizons between 1 and 39 inches for the series type location by Inter-Mountain Laboratories, Inc., Farmington, NM.  Salinity values were determined with an Instant EC salinity kit.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
