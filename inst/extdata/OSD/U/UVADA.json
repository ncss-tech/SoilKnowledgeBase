Buckaroo soils have Bk or Bqk horizons with 25 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Calneva soils have calcium carbonate equivalent of 2 to 5 percent in the Btnk and Bk horizons.    Effington soils have calcium carbonate equivalent less than 15 percent and have secondary gypsum below the natric horizon.  Kleinbush soils have a depth to secondary carbonates of 10 to 20 inches, clay or clay loam texture with calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 or less in the natric horizon, and have Bk horizons with 10 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Meeteetse soils have Less than 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the Bky and Bnky horizons.Ultra soils have a depth to the base of the natric horizon that ranges from 7 to 13 inches and are not calcareous throughout."
