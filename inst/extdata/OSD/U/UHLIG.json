The formatting was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nReference laboratory data--sample number S99WA-063-006; Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
