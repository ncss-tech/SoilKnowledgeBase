  "OVERVIEW": "The Ula series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone.  Ula soils are on mountain foot slopes and side slopes and have slopes of 2 to over 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is noncalcareous throughout.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent and are mostly angular cobbles and pebbles. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is typically cobbly or gravelly sandy clay loam, but the fine earth fraction has 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, 40 to 75 percent sand, with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral."
