  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is noncalcareous throughout.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent and are mostly angular cobbles and pebbles. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 44 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is typically cobbly or gravelly sandy clay loam, but the fine earth fraction has 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, 40 to 75 percent sand, with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral."

Amerant has mean summer soil temperature of more than 47 degrees F.  Beardal and Swapps soils have a lithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Rimton soils have a mixed E/B horizon and have hue yellower than 5YR in all horizons.  Wex soils have hues of 10YR and yellower in the Bt horizon."
