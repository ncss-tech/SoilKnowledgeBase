  "OVERVIEW": "The Unitylake series consists of very deep, well-drained soils on valley floors and swales of rolling hills. Unitylake soils formed in volcanic ash overlying material from soft tuffs. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.",
