  "OVERVIEW": "The Uselessbay series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy glacial outwash over dense glacial drift. Uselessbay soils are on summits and side slopes of narrow ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 830 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Indianola soils occur on convex hill slopes and terraces and have a sandy control section, lack a densic contact and redoximorphic features. Utsalady soils are on concave and broad flat summits and lack a densic contact. Sholander soils are in concave positions have redoximorphic feature beginning at 20 to 46 cm (somewhat poorly drained)."
