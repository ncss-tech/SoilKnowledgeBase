    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Uselessbay soils are on summits and shoulders of narrow ridges with elevations from 10 to 100 meters. They formed in sandy glacial outwash over dense glacial drift. These soils are in a mild marine climate with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 625 to 1150 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. Frost-free season is 200 to 240 days."

Elwha soils are coarse-loamy and occur on convex slopes on summits at elevations above 100 meters.  Indianola soils occur on convex hill slopes and terraces and have a sandy control section, lack a densic contact and redoximorphic features. Utsalady soils are on concave and broad flat summits and lack a densic contact. Sholander soils are in concave positions have redoximorphic feature beginning at 20 to 46 cm (somewhat poorly drained)."
