  "OVERVIEW": "The Uncas series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium, dominantly volcanic ash, with a surface layer of muck. Uncas soils are on bottomlands and in lake basins.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Some pedons have an AB or AC horizon with value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of l or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bg and Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; values of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and dominately have chroma of 1 or 2, moist or dry.
