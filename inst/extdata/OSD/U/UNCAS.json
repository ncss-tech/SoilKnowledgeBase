Some pedons have an AB or AC horizon with value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of l or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bg and Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y; values of 3 through 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and dominately have chroma of 1 or 2, moist or dry.  Redox concentrations range from few to many fine and medium. Reaction is neutral to  slightly alkaline."
