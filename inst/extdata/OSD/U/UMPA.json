Bertolotti, Cliffdell, Pitcher and Roxer soils have bedrock deeper than 60 inches. Deroux soils are formed in sandstone and volcanic ash with 60 percent volcanic ash in the A horizon, and have a mean annual soil temperature of 45 to 47 degrees F. with a frost free period of 145 to 170 days. In the Littlejohn soils, the moisture control section is dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days. Mountaineer soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to compact glacial till. Pheeney soils have an umbric epipedon. Scotties soils are 40 inches or deeper to sandstone bedrock."

They formed in material weathered from coarse textured recent andesitic flows and are often in the vicinity of cinder cones.  Stones and boulders are common on the surface.  The climate is humid and has mean annual precipitation of about 35 to 55 inches most of which falls as snow.  Average annual temperature is 40 degrees F, mean January temperature is 25 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 25 to 80 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Umpa soils were formerly classified as members of the loamy-skeletal, mixed family of Typic Cryochrepts.  Minerology is influenced but not dominated by pyroclastic material.  The profile was sampled and determinations were made for particle size distribution, organic carbon, 15 bar water, pH, base saturation, and cation exchange capabity.  Correlation sample no. was 69CA-31-7."
