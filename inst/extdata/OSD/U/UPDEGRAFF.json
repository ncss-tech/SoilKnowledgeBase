    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to rock is 40 to 60 inches.  The soil between a depth of 6 to 18 inches is dry in all parts from July through October and is moist in all parts from December through May.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 49 to 59 degrees F.  The base saturation by sum of cations is 50 to 90 percent throughout the profile and is less than 75 percent in some part of the upper 30 inches.  A stone line occurs in most pedons between a depth of 10 to 24 inches.  It contains 5 to 30 percent 2 to 75 mm gravel and 5 to 10 percent 75 to 150 mm cobbles.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick and has 1 to 5 percent organic matter.  The soil is moderately acid to neutral throughout.  The particle-size control section averages 30 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 30 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  It is loam in the upper part and may be gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam in the lower part if a stone line is present.  It has 15 to 27 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel in the upper 10 inches and may have 5 to 25 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles in the lower part with a stone line.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; or 7.5YR 5/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/4.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 25 to 40 percent clay and 5 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nSome pedons have a BCt or C horizon with the same colors and textures as the Bt.  It has a weaker structure and fewer clay films.  It is 0 to 15 inches thick."
