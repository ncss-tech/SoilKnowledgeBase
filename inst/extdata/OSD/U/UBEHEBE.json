  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ubehebe series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone, shale and related sedimentary and metamorphic rock. Ubehebe soils are on hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
