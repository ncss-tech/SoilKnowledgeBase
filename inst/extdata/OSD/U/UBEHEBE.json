These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from siltstone, shale, and related sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,676 to 2,717 meters. The climate is cool, with moist winters and warm, dry summers, except for occasional summer thunder showers. The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 330 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees , and the frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."
