    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 57 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at depths of 20 inches is 65 to 72 degrees F. These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 80 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nThe combined thickness of the E and Btn horizon ranges from 8 to 29 inches.  These soils have soluble salt content that ranges up to about 1.0 percent in some pedons. Some pedons contain slight or moderate amounts of gypsum in the C horizon.\nThe E horizon has dominant hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, but is 7.5YR in some pedons.  Value is 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 5 moist, and chroma is 2 to 4.  It is moderately to very strongly alkaline and moderately or strongly effervescent.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and 2 through 4 moist.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam. The Btn horizon has 15 to 75 percent exchangeable sodium. It is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline and moderately or strongly effervescent. This horizon has common to many thin clay films on faces of peds. It ranges from 6 to 23 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4. It ranges from sand to silty clay loam, but the sand is below a depth of 36 inches. The C horizon is moderately to very strongly alkaline and moderately or strongly effervescent."

Azabache soils contain sodium sulfate crystals and horizons with greater than 35 percent rock fragments within 40 inches.  Benally soils have B horizons with visible accumulations of carbonates and/or gypsum.  Fajada, Hadden and Muff soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Highrock soils lack columnar structure in the natric and have Bk horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates. Leebench and Leeko soils have a calcic horizon.  Pizene soils are 12 to 18 inches to free carbonates.  Recapture soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR.  Rusty soils are noneffervescent or slightly effervescent.  Swasey soils have hard bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Terlco soils have a Bk horizon and a sandy-skeletal substratum."

The soils formed in deltaic sediments and alluvium derived from mixed parent materials. The climate is arid. The average annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 56 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 66 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."
