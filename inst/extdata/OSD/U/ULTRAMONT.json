Kerrfield soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Linco soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Patter soils are not dominated by rock fragments which are fine gravel, have less than 40 percent medium sand through very coarse sand, and are strongly alkaline in the cambic horizon.  Prineville soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have 5 to 30 percent sand-size pumiceous ash grains in the upper part of the soil."
