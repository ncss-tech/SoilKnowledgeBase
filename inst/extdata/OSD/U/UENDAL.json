  "OVERVIEW": "The Uendal series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Uendal soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

(A horizon)\nCarbonates in the profile are considered primarily geogenic, and not secondary accumulations.\nLithic contact:  The contact with sandstone bedrock at 24 inches.  (R layer)\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nThe surface texture modifier was determined following the guidelines outlined in the Utah document, \"Procedures for Distributing Rock Fragments on the Surface Layer into the Upper 6 inches of Soil and Subsequent Naming of Map Units, April 1979.\"\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nThe Nelman series is in the process of being reclassified to an Aridic Ustic soil moisture regime and should not be considered a competitor to the Uendal series."
