  "OVERVIEW": "The Umil series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to an indurated duripan. These soils formed in mixed alluvium from igneous rocks and some sedimentary tuff. Umil soils are on eroded fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
