  "OVERVIEW": "The Urmafot series consists of very shallow or shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Urmafot soils are on fan remnants and partial ballenas.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
