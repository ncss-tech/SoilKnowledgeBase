  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Urmafot soils are on fan remnants and partial ballenas. They typically occur on backslope and summit positions. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks such as limestone, quartzite, and rhyolite. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,585 to 2,380 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
