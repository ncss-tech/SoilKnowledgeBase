  "OVERVIEW": "The Upler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Upler soils are on terrace remnants and hillslopes. Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
