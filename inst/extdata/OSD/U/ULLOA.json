    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 17 to 45 inches.  Organic carbon content of the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon is greater than 6 percent.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 40 inches.  Coarse fragment content of the particle-size control section ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is 46 degrees F.  Reaction increases with depth, ranging from extremely acid in the organic mat to neutral in the lower part of the mineral horizons..\nThe texture of the E horizon is sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  Colors range in hue from 10YR to 5YR, value moist from 4 to 7, and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 10 to 15 percent.\nThe texture of the B horizons is loam or silt loam but ranges to include sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent gravel.    Colors range in hue from 2.5YR to 10YR; value moist from 2 to 4, and chroma moist from 1 to 6."

Diobsud and Potchub soils have dense compact till within 40 inches of the mineral surface.  Fordsterror, Kulshan, and Tokeen soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the mineral surface.  Gallup and Vixen soils have pH less than 5.5 in the lower part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ulloa soils occur on strongly sloping to very steep hillslopes, valleysides, and toeslopes of valleybottoms.  The parent material is colluvium and residuum from limestone and marble. The climate is humid maritime with a mean annual precipitation of 100 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F, and the mean summer air temperature is 55 degrees F.  The slope gradient is commonly less than 60 percent, but ranges from 5 to 75 percent. Elevation ranges from sea level to 3000 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Karta, McGilvery, Sarkar, and Wadleigh soils.  Karta and Wadleigh soils are formed from glacial till and are found on hillslopes and valleysides. McGilvery soils consist of forest litter resting directly on bedrock on hillslopes.  Sarkar soils are shallow to calcareous bedrock."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are: a. albic horizon from 0 to 1 inch; a spodic horizon from 1 to 3 inches; more than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 2 inches of the spodic horizon; coarse-loamy material from 10 to 40 inches.  A cryic temperature regime is assumed.  The Ulloa series formerly classified as thixotropic.  That part of the spodic horizon that meets amorphous requirements does not extend more than 4 inches into the 10 to 40 inch control section.  The particle size of the control section has a significant relation to the physical and chemical properties of the soil.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Limited laboratory data is available for this soil: Stand Density Plot pedon number 131.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
