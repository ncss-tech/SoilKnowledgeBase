These soils are usually moist, and are dry 0 to 30 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic moisture regime. Depth to bedrock and thickness of the umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties and 50 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume. The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.80 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 20 to 35 percent for air dried samples. It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum. Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent. It is moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry. It has 7 to 20 percent organic matter with a weighted average of less than 10 percent below 20 inches and over 10 throughout the upper 12 inches.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist. It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, very gravelly sandy medial loam, or very gravelly medial loam. It has 2 to 7 percent organic matter."
