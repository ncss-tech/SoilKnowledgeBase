  "OVERVIEW": "The Underton series consists of moderately deep over a petrocalcic, well drained soils that formed in alluvium predominantly from limestone. Underton soils are on erosional stream terraces. Slopes are from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F.",

They typically occur on stream terrace summits and formed in alluvium derived from limestone clasts mixed with Tertiary sediments (Muddy Creek Formation). Slopes are from 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,000 feet. The climate is arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 to 7 inches, mean annual temperature is about 66 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 180 to 300 days."
