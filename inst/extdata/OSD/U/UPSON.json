  "OVERVIEW": "The Upson series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in highly weathered granite (gruss).  Upson soils are on mountain sides and crests and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
