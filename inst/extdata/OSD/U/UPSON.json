    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Stones ranging in size from 10 inches to larger than 25 inches cover 2 to 25 percent of the surface.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent by volume in a major part of the control section.  These range from 1/4 to 1 inch in diameter. The control section is typically sandy loam, but clay ranges from 10 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent, and 45 to 85 percent sand, with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral."
