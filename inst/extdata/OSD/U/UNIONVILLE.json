Embudo soils are underlain by stratified sandy and gravelly materials at 46 to 76 cm.  Hessing soils have very gravelly sand or loamy sand at depths of 64 to 90 cm.  Koyen soils have sola 36 to 53 cm thick and sandy loam control sections.  Monue soils have 5YR hues.  Quima soils are noncalcareous in their upper profiles.  Wall soils have less than 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand in their control sections and A and Bw horizons that are neutral or mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Unionville soils are on dissected gently rolling foothills.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks that was influenced by tufa.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,200 to 1,340 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
