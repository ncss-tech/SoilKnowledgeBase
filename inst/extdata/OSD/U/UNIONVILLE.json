  "OVERVIEW": "The Unionville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks with some influence from tufa.  The Unionville soils are on dissected gently rolling foothills.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
