  "OVERVIEW": "The Ustibuck series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey and loamy alluvium derived from the red beds of Permian Age. These nearly level to slightly concave soils are on backswamps on flood plains of large streams, in the North Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 910 mm (36 in), and mean annual air temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
