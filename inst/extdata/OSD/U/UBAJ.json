In addition, Cavendish has paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and is derived from basalt.  Kaiders is derived from basalt and has gravels in the lower part. Martis has gravels in the lower part and has volcanic parent material.  Teanaway is at elevations less than 762 meters and has a frost free period of greater than 80 days and has a base saturation of 55 to 75 percent.  Wafla is overlying weathered basalt at 100 to 178 cm and Wintoner lacks free water in the profile and is at elevations less that 701 meters."
