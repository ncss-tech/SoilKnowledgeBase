They formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation. Slopes are 8 to 70 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,900 to7,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

Adornado soils are ashy-pumiceous, have mollic epipedons, and occur on backslopes and footslopes of interfluves. Letrado soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and are on toeslopes of interfluves. Rotado soils are fine, moderately deep, and are on summits of interfluves. Tocal soils are clayey, have argillic horizons, and occur on shoulders of interfluves."
