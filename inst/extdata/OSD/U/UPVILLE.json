These soils formed in alluvium derived from granitic and mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 1,525 to 1,865 meters.  The climate is semiarid, with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
