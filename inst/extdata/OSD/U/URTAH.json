  "OVERVIEW": "The Urtah series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Urtah soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Lithology of fragments is limestone and dolomite.\nEffervescence - Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent, depending upon the presence of magnesium carbonate in the parent rock.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent - 40 to 50 percent in the fine-earth fraction.\nOther features - Some pedons have thin carbonate coats commonly on the bottoms of rock fragments but no horizon 15 cm or more thick has 5 percent or more by volume of identifiable secondary carbonates.\nA1 and A2 horizons\nValue: 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist.\nChroma: 1 through 3, except moist colors do not have value of 2 with chroma of 1.\nStructure: Weak or moderate, very fine or fine granular, weak, medium or thick platy structure.\nClay content: 10 to 15 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.\nOther features: The calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine-earth fraction allows for moist value of 4 and dry value of 6 in the Mollic epipedon.\nAC and C horizons\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly sandy clay loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam.\nClay content: 20 to 25 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 0.5 to 1 percent."
