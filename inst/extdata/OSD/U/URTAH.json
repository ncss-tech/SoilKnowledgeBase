Lithology of fragments is limestone and dolomite.\nEffervescence - Strongly effervescent or violently effervescent, depending upon the presence of magnesium carbonate in the parent rock.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent - 40 to 50 percent in the fine-earth fraction.\nOther features - Some pedons have thin carbonate coats commonly on the bottoms of rock fragments but no horizon 15 cm or more thick has 5 percent or more by volume of identifiable secondary carbonates.\nA1 and A2 horizons\nValue: 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist.\nChroma: 1 through 3, except moist colors do not have value of 2 with chroma of 1.\nStructure: Weak or moderate, very fine or fine granular, weak, medium or thick platy structure.\nClay content: 10 to 15 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.\nOther features: The calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine-earth fraction allows for moist value of 4 and dry value of 6 in the Mollic epipedon.\nAC and C horizons\nValue: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly sandy clay loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam.\nClay content: 20 to 25 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 0.5 to 1 percent."

Elevations range from 2,042 to 2,500 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 to 380 mm and comes mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. and the frost-free period is 55 to 75 days."
