The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Andic soil properties are present throughout a thickness of 14 to 30 inches and have 60 to 90 percent volcanic glass, 1.0 to 2.5 acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 50 to 85 percent phosphate retention, 3 to 12 percent 15-bar air-dry moisture content and 4 to 13 percent moist 15-bar water content.  The weighted average of 8xSi+2Xfe is 5 to 8.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 80 percent pumice fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

It is ashy coarse sandy loam or ashy sandy loam.  It contains 10 to 45 percent pumice paragravel, 0 to 10 percent cinder gravel, 5 to 30 percent pumice paracobbles, and 0 to 10 percent pumice parastones.\nThe Bw2 and Bw3 horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.

Mazama.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F and the frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."
