  "OVERVIEW": "The Undusk series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt with a very thin mantle of volcanic ash. Undusk soils are on backslopes and ridges of mountains and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average 35 to 60 percent.  The control section has 18 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have C horizons between 40 and 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and includes 0 to 10 percent shot like aggregates.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It has 35 to 50 percent pebbles and 0 to 20 percent cobbles and stones.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam or very cobbly loam."
