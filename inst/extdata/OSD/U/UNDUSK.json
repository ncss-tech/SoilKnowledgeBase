Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average 35 to 60 percent.  The control section has 18 to 25 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have C horizons between 40 and 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and includes 0 to 10 percent shot like aggregates.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It has 35 to 50 percent pebbles and 0 to 20 percent cobbles and stones.  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly loam or very cobbly loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Undusk soils are on backslopes and ridges of mountains at elevations of 2,000 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt with a very thin mantle of volcanic ash.  Summers are cool and dry.  Winters are cold and wet with snow cover from December through March.  The mean annual precipitation is 45 to 65 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
