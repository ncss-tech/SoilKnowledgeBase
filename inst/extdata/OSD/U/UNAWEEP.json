  "OVERVIEW": "The Unaweep series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately coarse textured alluvial fan sediments derived from sandstone and minor amounts of igneous rocks.  Unaweep soils are on alluvial fans and valley floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
