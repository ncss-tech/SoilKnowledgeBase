Baggs soils are non-calcareous throughout.  Baxton and Hopley soils are deep and have bedrock between 40 and 60 inches.  Bitterroot, Chincap, Vebar, Weedzunit, and Belain soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Panguitch soils have a calcic horizon.  Mott and Victor soils have sandy or sandy skeletal substratums.  Relan and Tally soils receive the major part of their precipitation during the summer."
