  "OVERVIEW": "The Udaho series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep to welded ash, that formed in colluvium and residuum from welded tuff and consolidated volcanic ash.  They are on hillslopes and breaks.  Slopes range from 10 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and average annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
