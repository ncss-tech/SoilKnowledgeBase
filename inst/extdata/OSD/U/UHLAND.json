    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth of alluvial sediments ranges from about 6 to 15 feet.  The solum is more than 80 inches thick.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline throughout. Average clay content of the 10- to 40- inch particle-size control section ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  There is an irregular decrease in organic carbon and most pedons have a buried A horizon within the particle-size control section.  Redox depletions and aquic conditions are in some subhorizon within a depth of 20 to 30 inches of the soil surface during most years.   Most pedons have few to about 5 percent siliceous and/or ironstone pebbles, mainly less than one half inch across, in some horizons.  Iron manganese concretions and/or masses range from few to common in some horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Horizons with moist value of 3 are less than 10 inches thick.  Some pedons have few to common iron concentrations in shades of brown or red.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bw or Bwb horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 6.  Iron concentrations in shades of brown, yellow or red range from few to many.  Iron depletions in shades of brown or gray with chroma of 2 or less range from few to common in some subhorizon within 30 inches of the soil surface.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam with or without subhorizons of loamy fine sand, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nBuried A horizons, where present, have  hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic features range from none to common.   Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to clay loam.\nBg or Bgb horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or more and chroma of 2 or less are typically below a depth of 40 inches and do not occur in some pedons.  Redoximorphic concentrations in shades of brown, yellow, or red range from few to many.  Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Similar soils include the Coarsewood, Sandow, Weswood, Yahola, Yomont, and Zavala series.  Coarsewood soils have coarse-silty control sections, and do not have a cambic horizon. Sandow soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Yahola, Yomont, and Zavala soils do not have aquic soil conditions in most years.  In addition, Yomont soils have coarse-silty control sections, and Zavala soils are in the hyperthermic temperature regime.  Weswood soils have fine-silty control sections and do not have aquic soil conditions in most years."

Edge and Crockett soils have clayey Bt horizons and are on higher upland positions. Padina soils are on higher upland positions and have sandy grossarenic surface and subsurface layers and a loamy Bt horizon.  Rader and Tabor soils are on slightly higher adjoining terrace positions.  They have loamy and clayey Bt horizons.  The fine-loamy Sandow soils are on similar flood plain positions.  Whitesboro soils are on similar flood plain positions and have mollic epipedons."

An apparent water table is at a depth of 2.0 to 3.5 feet of the surface during the spring months for a period of 30 to 60 days during most years.  The frequent flooding areas commonly flood three to five times annually for brief durations."

  "REMARKS": {

    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil has been previously included with the Iuka series.  The classification is changed from Aquic Ustifluvents to Aquic Ustochrepts (August, 1994) based on the results of a field study that indicates it has a cambic horizon.  It should be noted that an alternative  classification would be Fluvaquentic Ustochrepts.  This subgroup is not presently in Soil Taxonomy.  Texas plans to submit a proposal to include the Fluvaquentic subgroup in Ustochrepts.\nSuperactive cation exchange activity class.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 3 inches. (the A horizon)\nCambic horizon - 3 to 15 inches, and 22 to 43 inches the Bw and Bwb horizons.\nFluventic properties - buried horizons, Ab horizon at 15 to 22 inches and Ab'1 horizon at 43 to 48 inches.  Irregular decrease in organic-carbon content.\nAquic features - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within 30 inches of the soil surface and aquic soil conditions at a depth of 20 to 30 inches at some time during most years.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Type Location pedon STX94-395-001-001, Texas Agricultural Experiment Station Lab.\ndata.\nSOIL INTERPRETATION NUMBER: TX0007\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
