  "OVERVIEW": "The Ucross series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum or alluvium over residuum derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  Ucross soils are on fan remnants, hills and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The soils are typically effervescent to the surface but may be noneffervescent in the upper 6 inches of some pedons.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand.  It has 0 to 15 percent angular channers.  The moisture control section is usually moist in some or all parts in March through June.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam or silt loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nAn AC or Bw horizon is present in some pedons.  They have properties similar to both the A horizon and C horizon. The Bw horizon is not thick enough to be cambic.\nThe Bk horizon (and C horizon, when present) has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.   It has less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon consists of sandy and silty shale, or interbedded sandstone and shale.  The bedrock may be effervescent throughout, inconsistently effervescent in various layers, or noneffervescent.  Thin layers of lignite occur in some pedons at various depths."
