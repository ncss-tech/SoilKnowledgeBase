  "OVERVIEW": "The Ungene series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Ungene soils are on inset fans.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
