  "OVERVIEW": "The Unsel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Unsel soils are on fan remnants and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
