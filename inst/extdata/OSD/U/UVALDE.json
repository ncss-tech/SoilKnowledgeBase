The potential native plant community include grasses such as plains lovegrass, trichloris, Arizona cottontop, pinhole bluestem and plains bristlegrass and they are the dominant vegetation.  Perennial forbs make up about 5 percent of the community and shrubs make up about 3 percent.  With retrogression, plants such as threeawn, curlymesquite, hooded windmillgrass, Hall's panicum, fall witchgrass, and red grama increase or invade and are dominant in most areas.  A wide array of brush plants such as mesquite, guajillo, condalia, paloverde, guayacan, twisted acacia, white brush and pricklypear also increase or invade."
