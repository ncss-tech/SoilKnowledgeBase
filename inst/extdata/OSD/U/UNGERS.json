  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 55 inches and the base of the argillic horizon is within 40 inches.  Depth to sandstone and shale bedrock ranges from 40 to 80 inches or more.  Rock fragments of thin flat sandstone and shale increase with depth, ranging from 5 to 30 percent in the surface, from 5 to 60 percent in the B horizon, and 40 to 90 percent in the C.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid when unlimed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is weak fine granular or weak fine subangular blocky.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture of the fine-earth in the Bt horizon is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  The silt content ranges from about 15 to 40 percent and the sand content is more than 40 percent in the particle-size control section.  Structure is moderate fine or coarse subangular blocky.  The B horizon is typically friable in the upper part and firm in the lower part.\nThe C horizon is similar in color to the B horizon.  Fine-earth texture is loam or sandy loam.  Structure is weak fine subangular blocky or massive.  Consistence is very friable to firm."

Albemarle soils have rock fragments of quartz and arkosic sandstone.  Allegheny, Allenwood, Aura, Bedington, Bucks, Shelocta, and Thurmont soils have an argillic horizon extending below 40 inches.  Arendtsville soils have rock fragments of quartzite or aporhyolite.  Birdsboro, Chetwynd, and Elsinboro soils have rounded rock fragments.  Butano, Gilpin, and Syenite soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Chester and Tate soils have rock fragments of quartz, granite or gneiss.  Chilmark, Clymer, Edgemont, Edneytown, Quakertown, and Rayne soils have B horizons with hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Collington and Freehold soils contain glauconite.  Eubanks soils have angular quartz sand grains and gravel size quartz fragments in the solum.  Frankstown soils have rock fragments of siliceous limestone.  Glenelg soils contain mica.  Leck Kill soils have a B horizon with less than 40 percent sand.  Matapeake soils have a lithologic discontinuity.  Meadowville soils have rock fragments of quartz and contain mica.  Murrill soils have a solum greater than 60 inches thick.  Nixon soils have quartzite rock fragments, 70 percent of which are cobble size.  Shouns soils are formed in local alluvium or colluvium and commonly have silty clay loam Bt horizons.  Whiteford soils contain rock fragments of slate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on gently sloping to very steep convex slopes with gradients of about 0 to 50 percent.  Slopes of 3 to 15 percent are the most common.  The regolith is loamy residuum weathered from red sandstones and some shales.  The climate is humid temperate; mean annual rainfall ranges from 38 to 48 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 55 degrees F., and the growing season ranges from from 160 to 180 days."
