  "OVERVIEW": "The Usk series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountainsides and ridgetops.  These soils formed in residuum from granitic rock with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Elevation is 1,800 to 3,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 27 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The soil is usually moist in all horizons but is dry in all parts between 8 to 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments mostly 2 to 5 mm pebbles.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  Reaction is neutral to slightly acid.  Some pedons have a stony surface layer.\nThe A horizon has a value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The structure ranges from fine and medium granular to fine and medium subangular blocky.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  The structure  ranges from fine or medium granular to fine or medium subangular blocky.  The texture is gravelly loam or gravelly sandy loam with 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe BC and C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 to 5 moist, and chroma from 2 through 4 moist and dry.  The texture is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loamy coarse sand with 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.   The structure is fine to coarse subangular blocky or may be massive.  Some pedons have bands of dark brown (10YR 3/3) sandy loam in the lower part of the profile which ranges in thickness from fine (0.5 cm) to medium (15 cm)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent, but are predominantly 20 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 1,800 to 3,000 feet.  These soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  These soils occur in a continental climate having warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 30 inches; and the mean annual  temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 110 to 130 days."
