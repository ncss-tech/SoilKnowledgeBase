  "BYREV": "Rev. DMC-JBF-TM-JVC",
  "REVDATE": "06/2017",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Uhaldi series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  Uhaldi soils are on rock pediments, plateaus, and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is 8 degrees C.",
