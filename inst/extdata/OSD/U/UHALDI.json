  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Uhaldi soils are on the rock pediments, plateaus, and hills.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from tuffaceous sedimentary rocks such as sandstone and mudstone.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,680 to 1,985 meters.  The climate is semiarid cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 8 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 115 days."
