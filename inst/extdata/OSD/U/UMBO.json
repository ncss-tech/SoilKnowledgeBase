  "OVERVIEW": "The Umbo series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly and moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone, shale and limestone rocks.  Umbo soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
