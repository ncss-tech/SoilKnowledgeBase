The soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived dominantly from tuff.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches.  Average summer air temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  Average annual air temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 45 to 90 days."
