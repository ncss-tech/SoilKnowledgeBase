  "OVERVIEW": "The Ureal series consists of shallow to decomposing tuff, well drained soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived dominantly from tuff.  Ureal soils are on mountains and foothills and have slopes of 20 to 50 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
