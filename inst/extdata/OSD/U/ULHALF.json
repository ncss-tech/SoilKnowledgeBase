  "OVERVIEW": "The Ulhalf series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from basalt or andesite or metavolcanic rock.  Ulhalf soils are on plateaus and mountain back slopes or toe slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
