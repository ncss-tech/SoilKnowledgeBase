    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 22 centimeters (0 to 9 inches) (Ap horizons)\nCambic horizon: The zone from 22 to 47 centimeters (9 to 18.5 inches) (Bw horizon)\nFree carbonates: 0 to 200 centimeters (0 to 79 inches) (Ap, Bw, and Bk horizons)\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: 47 to 200 centimeters (18.5 to 79 inches)(Bk horizons)\nMoisture regime: ustic/aridic\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by lab sample numbers: 40A1811, 40A1813, 40A1814, 88P0864, 89P0137, 89P0727, 89P0734, 90P0719, 91P0807, 91P0809, 91P0810, 91P0811, 95P0481, 95P0482, 95P0486, and 14N0264.\nTaxonomic version: Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nSome soils formerly classified in the Ulysses series have free carbonates in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and throughout the cambic horizon. These soils would now be classified as Torriorthentic Haplustolls. ELF 09/1997\nModified format by LRM in 1/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nModified format by DEW in 12/2011 to meet MO5 standards.\nRemoved the calcareous modifier from the parent material description. TDC 04/2012\nChanged the subgroup classification from Aridic Haplustolls to Torriorthentic Haplustolls because 83 percent of the true Ulysses pedons are in the Torriorthentic Haplustolls subgroup. TDC 04/2016\nChanged the taxonomic version to the Twelfth Edition. TDC 04/2016\nMoved the type location to represent the new subgroup and to place it more toward the center of the Ulysses extent. TDC 04/2016\nEdited the Range in Characteristics for the horizons, based on statistics from 683 true Ulysses pedons. TDC 04/2016\nFree carbonates are allowed within 18 centimeters of the soil surface, but the effervescent strength is noneffervescent to slightly effervescent. TDC 04/2016\nAdded rises to the landform list, to comply with the MLRA 72 geomorphic description system. TDC 04/2016\nAdded elevation values, based on the Ulysses polygon extent and the topographic layers. TDC 04/2016\nEdited Mean Annual Precipitation and Frost Free Days values, based on NOAA data (1981-2000). TDC 04/2016\nAdded Buffalo Park to the associated soils list. TDC 04/2016\nExpanded the low end of the Runoff range from low to negligible to represent the areas with slope less than 1 percent, based on NSSH 618-49 (2003). TDC 04/2016\nAdded lab sample numbers that support the assignment of the cation-exchange activity class. TDC 04/2016\nKSSL lab pedon IDs that support the Ulysses series are 03N0884, 05N0784, 14N0264, 40A1811, 40A1813, 40A1814, 87P0017, 87P0026, 87P0029, 88P0864, 89P0137, 89P0727, 89P0734, 89P0737, 89P0741, 90P0719, 91P0807, 91P0809,91P0810, 91P0811,95P0481, 95P0482, and 95P0486. TDC 04/2016\nSome soils formerly classified in the Ulysses series do not have free carbonates in the lower part of the mollic epipedon or throughout the cambic horizon. These soils would now be classified as Aridic Haplustolls and are considered part of the Ulysses family. TDC 04/2016\nRemoved Oklahoma from the extent because Ulysses major components have been removed from that state. TDC 04/2016\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
