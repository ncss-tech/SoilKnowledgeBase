  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ugak series consists of deep, very poorly drained soils formed in volcanic ash deposits in depressional areas on moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 60 inches.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually, and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."
