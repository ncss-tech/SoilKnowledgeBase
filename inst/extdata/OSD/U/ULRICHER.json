    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The soil in some part between depths of 8 and 24 inches becomes moist in early November and remains moist until late June or early July. The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 50 degrees F. The solum has base saturation of less than 60 percent in all parts between depths of 10 and 30 inches. It contains up to 35 percent rock fragments by volume, but usually has less than 20 percent. The soil is medium or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam or silt loam and some pedons are stony. The soil is moderately acid to neutral. Structure is granular, platy or subangular blocky.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam or sandy loam and is gravelly or cobbly in most pedons. Some pedons are stony.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist. It is sandy loam or loamy sand and most pedons are gravelly or cobbly. Some pedons are stony."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ulricher soils are on uplands. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent, but are predominantly greater than 20 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from gneiss and other metamorphic rocks mixed with small amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Elevations are 2,200 to 4,600 feet. The climate is subhumid with a mean annual precipitation of 25 to 28 inches, most of which occurs in the winter. The mean annual temperature range from about 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost free season is about 100 to 130 days."
