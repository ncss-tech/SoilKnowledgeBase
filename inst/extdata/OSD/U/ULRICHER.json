  "OVERVIEW": "The Ulricher series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered form gneiss and other metamorphic rocks mixed with small amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Ulricher soils are on uplands and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The soil is medium or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam or silt loam and some pedons are stony. The soil is moderately acid to neutral. Structure is granular, platy or subangular blocky.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.
