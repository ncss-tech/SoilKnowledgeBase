  "OVERVIEW": "The Unakwik series consists of deep, poorly drained organic soils that formed in partially decomposed organic material over compact stony glacial till.  The organic material is derived mostly from sedges, interlayered with thin lenses of ash.  Unakwik soils occupy morainal hillsides and undulating terraces with abrupt escarpments.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from sea level to 500 feet.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 36 degrees F.  The lower part of the control section is often frozen after the Winter solstice.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the IIIC3 horizon ranges from 20 to 51 inches.  The upper fibric horizon may be derived in part from Sphagnum moss or may be entirely sedge peat.  The hemic horizons are derived from sedge, and range in color from 5YR 3/2 to 5YR 3/3.  Some pedons have a thin sapric horizon immediately above the mineral substratum.  Most pedons have two volcanic ash layers, but many have a third layer within the peat.  In some, no volcanic ash is visible.  The organic material is usually less than pH 4.5 (in 0.01 M CaC12).  Mean annual soil temperature is about 36 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 38 degrees F."

Hydaburg soils overlie bedrock at a depth of less than 51 inches.  Kina soils are thicker than 51 inches over a mineral substratum.  Doroshin soils freeze deeply in winter.  Funter soils consist of fibrous Sphagnum peat over a shallow mineral substratum.  Maybeso soils consist of sapric peat over a shallow mineral substratum."

Guguak and McGilvery soils consist of well drained forest litter over bedrock. Kupreanof soils are well drained and have a spodic horizon.  Tebenkof soils consist of forest litter over fragmental material.  Wadleigh soils are somewhat poorly drained mineral soils with a spodic horizon over very compact glacial till."
