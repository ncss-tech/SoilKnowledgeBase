  "OVERVIEW": "The Ulster series consists of deep, well drained soils formed\nmainly in loamy eolian materials on uplands.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the profile and rapid in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature\nis about 46 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.",

Pebbles typically are absent to a depth of 5 feet or more but in\nsome pedons are as shallow as 4 feet.  The control section\naverages between 14 and 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon typically is very dark gray (10YR 3/1) or very dark brown (10YR 2/2), but very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) is\nwithin the range.\nThe E, EB, or BE horizon, when present, typically is dark brown\n(10YR 4/3).\nThe Bt and BC horizons typically have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or\n5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Sand size in the Bt horizon dominantly\nis fine or very fine above 40 inches.\nThe 2BC or 2C horizon below 36 inches often is stratified loamy\nsand, sandy loam, silt loam, or sand.  A 3C horizon of loam\ntexture typically is present at depths between 5 to 8 feet but\nmay be as shallow as 4 feet."

Backbone soils have limestone bedrock at\ndepths between 20 and 40 inches.  Billett soils typically are\nsandy loam or fine sandy loam in the upper Bt horizon.  Billett\nsoils formed in loamy outwash, alluvium, or eolian materials.  Kingsley soils have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the B and C horizons.  Oronoco soils are finer textured in the 30- to 60-inch zone.  Pardeeville soils formed in coarse textured till and have redder\nhue.  Sattre and Wapsie soils have contrasting textures in the\nlower part of the control section.  Sattre soils are fine-loamy."
