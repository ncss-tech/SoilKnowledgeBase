Hanagita and Vorsid soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 6 degrees C.  Hazton profiles have a high percentage of medium and coarse angular sand. Jenkinson soils are channery loams or channery clay loams with thin rock fragments. Lotex soils Mollic epipedon does not include the entire profile and have soil temperature of 3 to 6 degrees C. Skisams soils are neutral or slightly alkaline. Spliten soils have Mollic epipedon that does not include the entire profile. Splitro have peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer and have Mollic epipedon that does not include the entire profile. Tuggle soils have Mollic epipedon that does not include the entire profile and are formed in residuum and colluviums derived from granitic and other coarse grained rocks. Vorsid soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 6 degrees C."

Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Elevations are 1,830 to 2,750 meters. The climate is cool, semi-arid, with most precipitation falling in winter and early spring. The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 560 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 60 to 80 days."
