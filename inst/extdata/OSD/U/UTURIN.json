  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

They formed in recently deposited alluvium that is 20 to 40 inches thick over buried alluvial soils.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 26 to 34 inches.  Annual frost free days range from 140 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1200 feet above mean sea level."

Rawles and McPaul soils are on slightly higher landscape positions and are moderately well drained.  Nishna soils are in similar landscapes positions as the Uturin soils.  Nishna soils have mollic epipedons."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are typically drained and cultivated.  The main crops grown are corn and soybeans.  Some areas are in pasture, some of which have scattered trees.  The native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Prairie Cordgrasses, Big Bluestems, Switchgrasses, Grays Sedges, Fox Sedges, Tall Tickseeds, and Great St. John Worts."
