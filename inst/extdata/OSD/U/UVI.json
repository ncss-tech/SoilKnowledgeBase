The soils formed in loess and residuum and colluvium from granite or metamorphic rocks with an admixture of volcanic ash.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 40 inches (559 to 1016 mm).  The average annual air temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F.  The frost free season ranges from 80 to 130 days."

Crumarine soils have a coarse-loamy textured control section and are somewhat poorly drained and are in bottomlands.  Threebear soils have a fragipan and formed in volcanic ash over loess.  Vassar soils have a mantle of volcanic ash in the surface layers."

As of 1/2008, the type location for Uvi has been moved from Latah County to Clearwater County.  The Uvi concept as previously mapped in Latah County has been primarily correlated to the Quinnamose, Cobbler, or Kruse series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
