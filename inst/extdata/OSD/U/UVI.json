  "OVERVIEW": "The Uvi series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and material from granitic or metamorphic rocks with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Uvi soils are on canyon sides and mountain slopes and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

As of 1/2008, the type location for Uvi has been moved from Latah County to Clearwater County.
