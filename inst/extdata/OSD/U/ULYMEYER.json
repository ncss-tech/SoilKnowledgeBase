  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ulymeyer soils formed on alluvial fans and fan terraces.  Many of these fans and fan terraces are part of long aprons along mountain range fronts.  They are dissected with some shallow washes and drainageways.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,465 to 1,955 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C; and the frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."

Haar family soils are shallow loamy soils over granitic bedrock on hillsides and mountain plateaus.  Rovana soils have sandy particle-size control sections on alluvial fans and fan terraces.  Bairs soils have argillic horizons and are on bouldery alluvial fans and fan terraces."
