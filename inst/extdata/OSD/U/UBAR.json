  "OVERVIEW": "The Ubar series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly or slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on basin floors.  Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
