  "OVERVIEW": "The Uptmor series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and material weathered from basalt, andesite, or greenstone.  Uptmor soils are on high plateaus, canyon benches, and foothills of mountains and have slopes of 3 to 40 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low.  The average annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
