The soils formed in loess and residuum weathered from Columbia River basalt or andesite or greenstone of the Seven Devils volcanics.  Elevations range from 1,700 to 5,000 feet (518 to 1524 meters).  The climate is subhumid with an average annual precipitation of 24 to 30 inches (610 to 760 mm).  Average frost free season (32 degrees F.) is 80 to 130 days.  Average annual temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F."
