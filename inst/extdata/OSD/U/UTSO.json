  "OVERVIEW": "The Utso series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, residuum and eolian deposits derived from shale and sandstone.  These soils are on hills and mountain slopes and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 41 degrees F.",
