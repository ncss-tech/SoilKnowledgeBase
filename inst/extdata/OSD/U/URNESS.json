  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the coprogenous earth and the depth to glacial till or lacustrine sediments ranges from 24 to more than 80 inches. The coprogenous earth comprises 1 to 25 percent by volume snail and clam shells and/or fragments 2 to 10mm in size. The particle-size control section has between 18 and 35 percent clay and less than 2 to 15 percent of fine sand and coarser particles.\nThe A and C (coprogenous earth) have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2 or is N 2/0 or N 3/0. It commonly has distinct or prominent mottles in most parts. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Content of organic matter ranges from 10 to 50 percent. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 5 to 25 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2 and commonly is mottled. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. It has from 0 to 8 percent by volume of rock fragments of mixed lithology. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Urness soils are in small to large shallow lake basins and sloughs. They formed in silty lake sediments (coprogenous earth limnic sediments) of postglacial age. They overlie calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments or till at depths of 2 to 7 feet or more. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches."
