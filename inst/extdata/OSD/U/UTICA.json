  "REVDATE": "03/2014",
  "STATES": "CO,MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Utica series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone. These soils are on stream terraces, outwash fans and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
