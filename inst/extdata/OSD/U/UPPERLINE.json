  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Upperline series consists of moderately deep to soft bedrock, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from limestone and sandstone over residuum from sandstone and siltstone. Upperline soils are on convex rock pediments. Slope ranges from 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
