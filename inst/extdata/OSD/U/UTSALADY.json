Indianola soils occur on convex hill slopes and terraces and lack redoximorphic features. Uselessbay soils are on convex slopes on summits and ridges and are 50 to 100 cm (moderately deep) to a densic contact. Sholander soils are in concave positions and have redoximorphic features beginning at 18 to 46 cm (somewhat poorly drained)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nAlbic horizon  the zone from 3 to 5 cm (E horizon)\nOchric epipedon\nParticle size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm (within the Bw1, Bw2, and Bw3 horizons)\nDepth to redoximorphic features - 79 cm (top of the Bg horizon)\nOxyaquic subgroup  79 cm to faint redox concentrations, assumed saturated for 30 or more cumulative days\nThis Utsalady series is being proposed for a low relief, striated glacial landscape that occurs in southern Island County and northern Kitsap County. In the Kitsap County Soil Survey the Ragnar series was mapped on similar landforms. Ragnar is similar but coarse loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and lacks redoximorphic features and saturation. The Utsalady series concept has potential to replace Ragnar in areas of Kitsap County. Investigation is needed to determine if the Ragnar series concept may be better suited for the eastern margin of the Puget lowlands (parts of King, Pierce, and Snohomish Counties)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
