Driest during May and June.  Typic aridic soil moisture regime.\nTexture:  Dominantly sand or fine sand throughout.  Thin horizons of loamy sand may be present in some pedons, but texture in the particle size control section averages sand or fine sand with less than 11 percent silt plus clay.\nCalcium carbonate:  These soils are effervescent throughout most or all of the particle size control section.  Many soils have noneffervescent upper horizons, but the series includes soils that are effervescent throughout.\nRock fragments: less than 15 percent\nA horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  3 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist\nB horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  3 through 6 dry, 2 through 5 moist\nChroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist\nC horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist\nChroma:  2 or 3, dry or moist\nCommonly these soils have A, B and C horizons, but the concept includes soils with AC profiles as well as recent C horizon material.  Most of the C horizon material occurs as historical coppice dunes."

Bluepoint soils average at least 11 percent silt plus clay in the particle size control section.  Brazito soils are noneffervescent in the particle size control section and are on flood plains and low stream terraces.  Cajon soils are dry from March to December and contain granite gravel.  Maynard Lake soils contain significant amounts of volcanic ash.  Moapa soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Pintura soils have hue redder than 7.5YR.  Toquop soils have secondary gypsum accumulations.  Yturbide soils average between 15 and 35 percent gravel in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The University soils are on alluvial fans, sandy ridges and dunes.  On fans and ridges, slopes range from 3 to 80 percent.  Tops of dunes are usually gently undulating, with upper side slopes of about 20 percent; lower side slopes of the dunes range up to 80 percent.  Elevations range from 3500 to 4500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 170 to 200 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 5 inches (A horizon)\nEntisol feature - The absence of diagnostic subsurface horizons\nThis series represents an identified soil within the Desert Soil-Geomorphology Project, Las Cruces, New Mexico.  The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Use or revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data for the typical pedon (S59NMex-7-10) are on p. 778-779 in Gile, L.H. and R.B. Grossman. 1979. The Desert Project Soil Monograph.  National Technical Information Service, Springfield, Va.  Further information on the typical pedon and its landscape are on pages 192-197 in Gile, L.H., J.W. Hawley, and R.B. Grossman. 1981.  The Desert Project Guidebook.
