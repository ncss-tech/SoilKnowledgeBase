  "OVERVIEW": "The Upsel series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Upsel series are on mountain side slopes. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
