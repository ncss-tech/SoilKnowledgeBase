    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Organic materials extend throughout the 130 cm control section. Thickness of the organic layer over water ranges from 51 to 127 cm.\nThe Oi horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is peat primarily composed of living roots and sphagnum moss. It is extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Oe1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is mucky peat primarily composed of sphagnum and herbaceous fibers. It averages between 2 and 20 percent woody fragments. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThese upper horizons are floating on top of the 2Oe horizon.\nThe 2Oe horizon is water with 2 to 25 percent suspended organic solids with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 1 through 4.  The organic solids are mucky peat. It averages between 2 and 20 percent woody fragments. It is very strongly acid to slightly acid. In some pedons there may be thin layers of muck or peat included. This horizon is fluid.\nThe Oe3 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 4. It is mucky peat. It averages between 2 and 20 percent woody fragments. It is very strongly acid to slightly acid. In some pedons there may be thin layers of muck or peat.\nSome pedons have Oi or Oa horizons.\nIn places there is a 3Cg horizon composed of mineral soil material that ranges from clay loam to gravelly sand."

Slopes range from 0 to less than 1 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C., and the mean annual precipitation is 585 to 865 mm. Annual frost free days range from 90 to 120 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 185 to 640 meters."
