  "REVDATE": "04/2009",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Uracca series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fan sediments from mixed rocks, colluvium over residuum derived from granite, gneiss, and mica schist.  These soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants,valley side slopes, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
