  "OVERVIEW": "The Uwell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks over lacustrine sediments. The Uwell soils are on alluvial flats, inset fans and lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
