Texture is sandy loam, loam, their gravelly, cobbly, or stony analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma from 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, and gray range from few to many, decreasing with depth and may be absent in the lower Bw horizons of some pedons. Texture is sandy loam, loam, their gravelly, cobbly, or stony analogs..\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, their gravelly, cobbly, or stony analogs..\nThe Cr horizon is composed of saprolite that can be dug with a spade and has a texture of loamy sand or sandy loam."

The climate is humid tropical.  Slopes range from 25 to 95 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 67 to 71 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 150 inches."

The poorly drained Ciales soils are on lower positions and have fine-loamy control sections.  The poorly drained Guayabota soils are on higher positions and are shallow to bedrock.  Icacos soils are on lower adjacent flood plains and have fine-loamy control sections.  The well drained Los Guineos soils are on higher positions and have more clay in the control section.  Picacho soils are on higher positions and have fine-loamy control sections.  The moderately well drained Yunque soils are on higher positions and have more clay in the control sections."
