  "STATUS": "Established Series",

  "REVDATE": "02/2002",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Utuado series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately rapid permeable soils on middle and lower side slopes of strongly dissected uplands.  They formed in residuum in the plutonic uplands that weathered from granodiorite of the Rio Blanco stock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 69 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 120 inches.  Slopes range from 25 to 95 percent.",
