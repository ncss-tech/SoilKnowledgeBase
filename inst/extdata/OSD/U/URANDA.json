Some pedons have an A horizon up to 4 inches thick or an Ap horizon. The combined thickness of the A and E horizon is 5 inches or less. The soil contains 1 to 10 percent rock fragments throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 4 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  The E horizon is absent in some pedons that have an Ap horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam averaging between 24 and 35 percent clay.  It has moderate or strong, fine to coarse columnar structure in the upper part. Columns are often destroyed if cultivated, resulting in prismatic structure.  Most pedons have accumulations of salts, especially in the lower part.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 3 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It has common or many accumulations of carbonates.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  In some pedons the Bk horizon does not have accumulations of gypsum or other salts.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 7 and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have thin strata of gravelly sand below a depth of 40 inches."
