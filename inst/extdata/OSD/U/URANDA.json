  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 5 to 25 inches.  Depth to horizons with gypsum or salt accumulations ranges from 5 to 16 inches. Some pedons have an A horizon up to 4 inches thick or an Ap horizon. The combined thickness of the A and E horizon is 5 inches or less. The soil contains 1 to 10 percent rock fragments throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 4 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1.  It is loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  The E horizon is absent in some pedons that have an Ap horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam or loam averaging between 24 and 35 percent clay.  It has moderate or strong, fine to coarse columnar structure in the upper part. Columns are often destroyed if cultivated, resulting in prismatic structure.  Most pedons have accumulations of salts, especially in the lower part.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 3 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It has common or many accumulations of carbonates.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  In some pedons the Bk horizon does not have accumulations of gypsum or other salts.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 7 and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have thin strata of gravelly sand below a depth of 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Uranda soils are level to strongly sloping on coarse-loamy till plains.  Slope gradients typically are less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The Uranda soils formed in calcareous loam till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 20 inches.  Frost-free period ranges from 110 to 140 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 900 to 2300 feet."

Cathay, Emrick, Heimdal and Larson soils are on higher parts of the landscapes.  Cathay soils do not have columnar structure in the Btn horizon and have a glossic horizon.  Emrick, Heimdal and Tonka soils do not have a natric horizon.  In addition, Tonka soils have an aquic moisture regime and are in depressions.  Fram soils do not have an natric horizon.  Larson soils have combined A and E horizons thicker than 5 inches and do not have accumulations of salt within a depth of 16 inches."
