  "OVERVIEW": "Uana soils consist of moderately deep over a duripan, well drained soils that formed on eroded fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Uana soils formed in alluvium derived from welded tuff and reworked lacustrine sediments. The mean annual precipitation is about 275 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
