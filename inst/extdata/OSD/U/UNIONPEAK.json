  "OVERVIEW": "The Unionpeak series consists of moderately deep to a very weakly to weakly cemented duripan, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in ash deposits derived from volcanic ash, pumice, cinders, andesite, and dacite.  Unionpeak soils are on ash flows and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The soils formed in ash deposits derived mainly from volcanic ash, pumice, andesitic cinders, and andesite from Mt. Mazama.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches, falling mainly as snow.  The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F and the frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."
