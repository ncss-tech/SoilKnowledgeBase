  "OVERVIEW": "The Unionpeak series consists of moderately deep to a very weakly to weakly cemented duripan, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in ash deposits derived from volcanic ash, pumice, cinders, andesite, and dacite.  Unionpeak soils are on ash flows and have slopes of 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

The weighted average 8xSi+2xFe is 5 to 8.  The particle size control section averages less than 35 percent rock and pararock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 15 percent pumice paragravel, 0 to 10 percent cinder gravel, and 0 to 5 percent andesite gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy sand or ashy sandy loam and contains 0 to 10 percent pumice paragravel, 0 to 10 percent cinder gravel, and 0 to 5 percent andesite gravel.\nThe Bqm horizon is very weakly to weakly cemented.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

The soils formed in ash deposits derived mainly from volcanic ash, pumice, andesitic cinders, and andesite from Mt. Mazama.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches, falling mainly as snow.  The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F and the frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."

If this property is not present, depending on slope, runoff may be low.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Reference samples S00OR-035-003; the reference sample pedon is a taxadjunct in that it is glassy with a value of 4.3 for 8xSi+2xFe.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
