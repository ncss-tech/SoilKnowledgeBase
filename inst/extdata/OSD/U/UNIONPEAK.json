The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 30 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Andic soil properties are present throughout a thickness of 20 to 40 inches and has 60 to 90 percent volcanic glass, 1.0 to 2.5 acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 50 to 85 percent phosphate retention, 3 to 12 percent air-dry 15-bar water content and 4 to 13 percent undried 15 bar water.  The weighted average 8xSi+2xFe is 5 to 8.  The particle size control section averages less than 35 percent rock and pararock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 15 percent pumice paragravel, 0 to 10 percent cinder gravel, and 0 to 5 percent andesite gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy sand or ashy sandy loam and contains 0 to 10 percent pumice paragravel, 0 to 10 percent cinder gravel, and 0 to 5 percent andesite gravel.\nThe Bqm horizon is very weakly to weakly cemented.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy loamy sand or ashy sand.  The upper part has a dry consistence of hard and the lower part has a dry consistence of slightly hard or soft.  It contains 0 to 30 percent pumice paragravel, 0 to 25 percent cinder gravel, 0 to 15 percent andesite gravel, and 0 to 5 percent cinder cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Unionpeak soils are on ash flows at elevations of 4,500 to 7,000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in ash deposits derived mainly from volcanic ash, pumice, andesitic cinders, and andesite from Mt. Mazama.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches, falling mainly as snow.  The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 42 degrees F and the frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."

If this property is not present, depending on slope, runoff may be low.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Reference samples S00OR-035-003; the reference sample pedon is a taxadjunct in that it is glassy with a value of 4.3 for 8xSi+2xFe.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
