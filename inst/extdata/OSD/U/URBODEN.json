These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year (perudic).  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The particle-size control section has andic soil properties with 35 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 6 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 35 to 50 percent for air dried samples.  Acid oxalate iron is 2.0 to 3.5 percent.  Organic matter is 20 to 40 percent in the umbric epipedon and decreases to 7 percent in the cambic horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 or 4 dry.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 2 to 8 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y moist, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2, 3, 4, or 6 moist and 4 or 6 dry.
