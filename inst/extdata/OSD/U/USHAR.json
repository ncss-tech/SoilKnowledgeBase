  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ushar soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping alluvial fans, outwash plains, and moderately steep to very steep mountain slopes.  Slopes are dominantly from 1 to 30 percent but range from 0 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in deep alluvium from intermediate igneous rocks and quartzite.  Some areas are locally influenced by loess or silty alluvium from loess.  Elevations range from 4,400 to 6,800 feet.  The average annual temperature is about 46 to 49 F., the average summer temperature is about 64 to 66 F., and the average annual precipitation is about 10 to 14 inches.  The frost free-period is 100 to 125 days."

Etta, Mosida, and Sheeprock soils lack Bw and Bk horizons.  Sheeprock soils are also very gravelly and sandy.  Firmage soils lack Bw horizons, are cobbly throughout, and lack mollic epipedons.  Flowell soils have Bt horizons containing more than 35 percent clay.  Mill Hollow soils lack Bw horizons.  Murdock soils lack Bw horizons and have an indurated lime cemented hardpan.  Pahro soils lack Bw horizons and are very gravelly throughout.  Etta soils are on floodplains.  Firmage soils are on foothills.  Flowell, Mill Hollow, Pharo, and Sheeprock soils are on alluvial fans and foothills.  Mosida soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans.  Murdock soils are on dissected terraces."
