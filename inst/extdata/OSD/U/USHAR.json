  "OVERVIEW": "The Ushar series consists of very deep, well drained soils on nearly level to strongly sloping alluvial fans, outwash plains, and moderately steep to very steep mountainsides.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium with a loess influence in some areas.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Slopes are dominantly from 1 to 30 percent but range from 0 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in deep alluvium from intermediate igneous rocks and quartzite.  Some areas are locally influenced by loess or silty alluvium from loess.  Elevations range from 4,400 to 6,800 feet.  The average annual temperature is about 46 to 49 F., the average summer temperature is about 64 to 66 F., and the average annual precipitation is about 10 to 14 inches.  The frost free-period is 100 to 125 days."

Flowell soils have Bt horizons containing more than 35 percent clay.  Mill Hollow soils lack Bw horizons.  Murdock soils lack Bw horizons and have an indurated lime cemented hardpan.  Pahro soils lack Bw horizons and are very gravelly throughout.  Etta soils are on floodplains.  Firmage soils are on foothills.  Flowell, Mill Hollow, Pharo, and Sheeprock soils are on alluvial fans and foothills.  Mosida soils are on floodplains and alluvial fans.  Murdock soils are on dissected terraces."
