Updated competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 0 to 33 in. (A and Bk horizon)\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in)  (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon - 13 to 33 cm (5 to 13 in)  (Bk horizon).  It is not required for the series.\nPetrocalcic horizon - 33 to 53 cm (13 to 21 in)  (Bkkm horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  There is no lab data from this site but there is NSSL data from a pedon in Terrell County with Pedon ID of 85TX443001.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
