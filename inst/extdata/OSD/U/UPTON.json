  "STATES": "NM,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Upton series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained, and moderately permeable.  They formed in gravelly, calcareous loamy slope alluvium and/or colluvium derived from limestone and marl.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping footslopes or fans of ridges on dissected plateaus.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 381 mm (15 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F).",
