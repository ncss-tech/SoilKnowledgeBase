    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 12 to 33 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent channers.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, and is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.   The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  It usually has granular structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Where colors are dark enough to be mollic the values are derived from parent material weathered from dark colored shales. Texture is usually clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with clay ranging from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 10 to 40 percent, and sand from 15 to 50 percent with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  This horizon usually has prismatic structure but has angular or subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay, clay loam, silty clay or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 6 to 12 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, sandy clay loam, loam or clay.  It has 6 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline. Some areas have a sandy or gravelly substratum below 40 inches.\nSome pedons have a C horizon."

Agua Fria, Arp and Falfa soils have hue of 7.5Y or redder below the A horizon.  Arp, Mughouse, Rencalson, Renohill and Winklo soils have either a lithic or a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bessemer soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the Bk horizon.  Manzanola soils are calcareous below depths of 0 to 5 inches.  Wyarno soils have a solum that is less than 15 inches to the base of the B3 horizon or less than 10 inches to the base of the B2t horizon."

The soils formed in fine and medium textured alluvium derived from interbedded shales and agrillaceous sandstone.  Elevations are 3,500 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches with over half of the annual precipitation falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 105 to 130 days."
