Rock fragments including hard cinders in the control section average 35 to 70 percent by volume.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Structure is weak subangular blocky or is single grained.  Some pedons have an ash mantle up to 7 inches thick.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 8 moist and dry. Texture is very stony loamy sand, very stony sandy loam, or very gravelly loamy sand.  Rock content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  The Bs1 is similar but can be gravelly loamy sand if formed in the ash mantle.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 40 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It is a very stony loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly sand.  Rock content ranges from 40 to 70 percent."

The soils formed in volcanic ash, glacial till, and colluvium from granite and low grade metamorphic rocks.  The mean temperature is about 44 degrees F, the average annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 130 inches.  The frost-free season is 110 to 150 days."
