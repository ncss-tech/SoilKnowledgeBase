Decram, Midelight, Parachute, Sebud, and Tiban soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Fairydell, Farlow, Kamack, Maurice, Silvercliff, and Thornburgh soils are deep. Foxmont and Grafen soils have Cr horizons at 50 to 100 cm and lack secondary carbonates.  Rockabin soils have very gravelly textures and 5 percent or less stones in the profile.  Supervisor soils have O horizons and lack secondary carbonates in the profile."
