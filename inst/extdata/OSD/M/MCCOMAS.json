The soil is usually moist for prolonged periods during the winter and spring, but is dry within all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 days following the summer solstice. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 degrees F. Stones and cobbles are scattered over the surface in varying amounts.  Depth to high chroma iron accumulations is 4 to 10 inches, and depth to depletions having chroma of 2 or less is 20 to 30 inches.  Base saturation is less than 75 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very cobbly silty clay loam or very cobbly clay loam, with 30 to 40 percent clay.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel and 30 to 45 percent cobbles.
