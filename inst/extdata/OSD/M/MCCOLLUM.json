  "BYREV": "Rev. BDD-GLS-RJS",
  "REVDATE": "09/2008",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The McCollum series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
