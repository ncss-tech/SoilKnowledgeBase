The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F from January 15 to December 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.  The calcium carbonate content is less than 5 percent increase over any underlying horizon.  There is some dune micro relief under the shrubs.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3; or 2.5Y 7/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2; or 2.5Y 4/2.  Moist values below 4 are usually above 6 inches in depth.  The clay content ranges from 4 to 7 percent.  The lower part is slightly to strongly effervescent.  Some pedons do not have calcareous rock 2 to 10 mm in size.\nThe upper part of the C horizon is 10YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, or 6/4; or 2.5Y 7/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/3, 5/4; or 2.5Y 4/4.

Arnold soils have a paralithic contact within 60 inches and lack effervescence.  Briones soils have a paralithic contact within 40 inches, slightly to strongly acid reactions and lack effervescence.  Calhi soils have high percentages of exchangeable sodium and are alluvial (less than 15 percent slopes).  Corralitos soils are neutral to strongly acid and do not have effervescence.  Delhi soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline, they do not have effervescence and are alluvial (less than 15 percent slope).  Monoridge soils have a paralithic contact within 30 inches and have slopes of 30 to 65 percent.  Tujunga soils have slightly acid to neutral A horizons, do not have effervescence and are alluvial (less than 9 percent slope)."

The pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HCL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
