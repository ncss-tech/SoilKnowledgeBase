  "OVERVIEW": "The Margo series consists of deep, moderately well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in local alluvial or colluvial materials weathered from mica schist.  These soils are in depressions, along drainageways, and on toe slopes in the Piedmont Province and on terraces in the Coastal Plain.  Slopes are commonly concave and range from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual temperature is above 15 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 107 cm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 75 to 150 cm.  Depth to hard bedrock is greater than 180 cm.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the A horizon, all parts of the B2t horizon except the deepest subhorizon, and from 0 to 35 percent in the deepest subhorizon, and 0 to 15 percent in the C horizon.  The C horizon of some pedons contain partly weathered fragments of\nmica schist.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid, throughout, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Some mottles in the upper part of the B2t horizon have chroma of 2 or less.  In some pedons the\nlower part of the B2t horizon is dominantly gray.  The B2t horizon is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam and includes individual subhorizons of sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  The deepest B2t horizons may be gravelly.\nThe C horizon is mostly residuum of weathered mica schist.  In some places the upper part of the C horizon is in alluvial or colluvial material.  It is multicolor and commonly contains shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray.  Generally, it does not have a dominant color.  It is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Sandier textures are the result of sandsize flakes of mica."

They also occur on terraces in the Coastal Plain in sediments washed from the Piedmont.  Slopes are commonly concave and range in gradient from 0 to 7 percent.  These soils formed in alluvial and colluvial material underlain by weathered mica schist or Coastal Plain sediments at depth of 50 to 130 cm."

The Brockroad, Catharpin, Nason, and Tatum soils are better drained, have higher clay content in their subsoils, and are on higher landscape positions.  LaRoque soils are better drained and are on higher landscape positions.  The Toddstav soils are poorly drained."
