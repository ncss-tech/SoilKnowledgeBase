  "OVERVIEW": "The Massai series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from rhyolitic tuff.  Massai soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes range from 20 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
