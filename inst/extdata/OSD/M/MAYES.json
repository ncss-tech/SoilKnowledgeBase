Choteau and Dennis soils occur on slightly higher landscape positions, do not contain smectitic (montmorillonitic) mineralogy, and contain no aquic moisture regime.  Parsons and Taloka soils occur on similar landscape positions, have an abrupt texture change from the albic horizon to the argillic horizon, do not have mollic epipedon, and do not contain smectitic (montmorillonitic) mineralogy.  Lenapah soils are well drained and are shallow to limestone and occur on slightly lower landscape positions.  Okemah soils occur on similar landscape positions, contain no aquic moisture regime, and do not contain smectitic (montmorillonitic) mineralogy.  Lula soils are moderately well drained and moderately deep to limestone and occur on slightly lower landscape positions.  Summit soils occur on similar landscape positions and contain no aquic moisture regime.  Apperson soils occur on interfluves on plains and do not contain smectitic (montmorillonitic) mineralogy."
