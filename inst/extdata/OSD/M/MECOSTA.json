  "OVERVIEW": "The Mecosta series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in sand and gravel deposits. These soils are on outwash plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Bonaparte soils compete closely on soil properties but are not commonly sand in the upper part of the series control section. Hinckley, Manchester, Otisville, and Quonset soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Multorpor soils receive more than 889 (35 inches) of mean annual precipitation. Rikers soils contain carboliths in the series control section."
