    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bonaparte, Hinckley, Manchester, Multorpor, Otisville, Quonset, and Rikers series. Bonaparte soils compete closely on soil properties but are not commonly sand in the upper part of the series control section. Hinckley, Manchester, Otisville, and Quonset soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Multorpor soils receive more than 889 (35 inches) of mean annual precipitation. Rikers soils contain carboliths in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 889 mm (28 to 35 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F)."

Coloma soils lack a calcareous 2C horizon, and are on similar topographic positions as Mecosta soils. The moderately well drained Covert and somewhat poorly drained Riverdale soils are on lower positions than the Mecosta soils."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high. Permeability is rapid in the solum and very rapid in the substratum."
