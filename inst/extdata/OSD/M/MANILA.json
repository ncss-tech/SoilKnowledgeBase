  "OVERVIEW": "The Manila series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Manila soils are on alluvial fans, mountain slopes, hills, and fan terraces and have 0 to 50 percent slopes.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
