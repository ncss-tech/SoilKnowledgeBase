The Beckett, Marlow and Plaisted soils have spodic horizons less than 18 inches thick. The Beckett soils have in 20 to 80 percent of the substratum textures of loamy fine sand or coarser.  The Plaisted soils have more than 10 percent clay in the particle size control section.\nThe Crary, Chesuncook, Howland, Peru and Skerry soils are in related families.  These soils have a spodic horizon less than 18 inches thick or a Bh horizon less than 4 inches thick. Chesuncook soils have more than 10 percent clay in the particle size control section. Howland soils have more than 50 percent silt in the mineral solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mundal soils are on gently sloping to very steep glaciated uplands.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in compact, loamy glacial till of Wisconsin age that is derived mainly from schist, gneiss,  granite, or anorthosite.   Mean annual precipitation ranges  from 40 to 60 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges  from 38 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from  about 60 to 120 days. Elevation is typically between about 1,500 to 2,500 feet."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. The classification is changed from coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Aquic Haplorthods to coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Oxyaquic Haplorthods with this revision to comply with Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 7th, 8th and 9th editions.  The competing series section was re-written accordingly.\n2. It is recognized the Cd from 27 to 59 inches has contradictory characteristics.  It is described as having platy structure yet has roots and iron accumulation on faces of prisms.  This was not resolved at this revision in light of the historical record of the development of the series as follows:\nIn 1979 the layer was described as having: weak coarse prismatic separating to moderate thick platy structure; dark reddish brown (5YR 3/2) interfingers on ped faces; olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) and reddish brown (5YR 4/3) prism faces; common patchy clay films on ped faces; and few roots on prism faces. In 1983 the coarse prismatic structure was revised to very coarse.  In 1984 prismatic structure was removed but evidenced by color of, and roots along prism faces.  Previous documentation of clay films was removed.  In 1993 the soil was re-classified from Typic Haplorthod to Aquic Haplorthod and the colors originally described as those of the prism faces were referred to as masses of iron accumulation on prism faces.  The 1993 revised description does not include abundance, size and contrast of these masses.\nIn 1979 the layer from 57 to 90 inches was described as having weak, medium and coarse angular blocky structure, friable consistence and few thin patchy clay films on ped faces and bridging sand grains.  In 1984 its designation was changed from C to Cr2; structure deleted and replaced with massive; consistence changed from friable to firm; and documentation of clay films deleted.  In 1986, the Cr1 and Cr2 were revised to Cd1 and Cd2 and the range in characteristics originally developed for the C horizon was deleted.\n3. The type location description varies from that in the published soil survey of Windham County.  Neither description places the site in the map unit noted in the taxonomic descriptions.  For this reason, the addition of grid coordinates was not attempted with this revision.\n4. The diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:   a.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A and E horizons).   b.  Spodic Horizon - contained in the zone from 3 to 25 inches (Bh and Bs  horizons). It is assumed the spodic horizon contains spodic materials as defined in The Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nThe following are remarks from the previous revision, 09/93.\n1.  As originally proposed, the Mundal series was  classified as thixotropic Cryic Fragiorthods.  Further study  indicated the temperature regime of these soils is frigid.\n2.  The Mundal series was reclassified in 1993 from coarse-loamy mixed frigid Typic Haplorthods to coarse-loamy mixed frigid Aquic Haplorthods to conform to The Keys To Soil Taxonomy, 1992 edition.\n3. Albic horizons are often hard to locate because tree throws and other disturbances have destroyed the albic horizons in many areas of Mundal soils.  When found, albic horizons are often thin, discontinuous, and located within 4 inches of the soil surface.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This series is based on field profile  descriptions and laboratory data from New York and Vermont.  NSSL data is available for the typical pedon S79VT25-2(1-5)  and for pedon S79VT-25-3(1-4).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
