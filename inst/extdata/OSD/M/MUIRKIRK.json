  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the upper solum.  The 2Bt horizon does not contain coarse fragments.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid in the A, E, and BE horizons and from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the Bt and 2Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma\nf 1 to 4 . Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 through 5.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10R, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture is  sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10R, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 to 8.  The 2Bt horizon grades, either gradually or abruptly, and irregularly into a massive, red, yellow, brown, pink and white clays.\nCOMPETING SERIES  Muirkirk is the only series in this family.  Wicks- burg is a similar soil with mean annual soil temperature greater than 59 degrees F."
