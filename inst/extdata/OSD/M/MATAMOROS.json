  "OVERVIEW": "The Matamoros series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous and clayey alluvial sediments.  These soils are on nearly level bottomlands. Slopes are less than 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average texture of the 10- to 40-inch control section is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with clay content of 35 to 55 percent.\nTexture of individual stratum ranges from very fine sandy loam to clay.  Thickness of loamy layers ranges from 1 to about 4 inches and their combined thickness ranges from about 2 to 10 inches.\nThe soils, when dry, have cracks, 1 to 10 cm wide that reach to a depth of at least 50 cm, and have a COLE of 0.07 to 0.13. One or more Ab horizons occur at depths of 20 to 50 inches in some pedons.\nThe A and C horizons to a depth of 40 inches are grayish brown (10YR 5/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), brown (10YR 5/3), or pale brown (10YR 6/3).  Moist value of the A horizon is more than 3.5, or if less than 3.5, the horizon is less than 10 inches thick.  The grayish colors with chromas of 2 or less are due to the alluvial sediments and not due to wetness.  Mottling ranges from none to a few faint yellowish brown mottles in the lower part.   Conductivity is 0.8 to 4.0 mmhos/cm at 25 degrees C."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family. Similar soils include Camargo, Chargo, Grulla, and Mangum series. Camargo soils have fine-silty control sections.  Chargo soils lack evident stratification in the 10- to 40-inch control section and have B horizons.  Grulla soils are saturated for several weeks during most years and have grayish coloration due to wetness.  Mangum soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Matamoros soils occur on nearly level active flood plains of the Rio Grande and its tributaries.  These soils flood about once every 5 to 10 years.  The soil formed in clayey sediments that are slightly altered and several feet thick. Slope gradients are less than 1 percent.  The climate is semiarid to dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 27 inches, mean annual temperature of 71 to 74 degrees F., and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices of 24 to 32."

Camargo soils occur on similar surfaces and Grulla soils occur in depressions.  Rio Grande soils have coarse-silty control sections and occur at lower elevations on younger terraces."
