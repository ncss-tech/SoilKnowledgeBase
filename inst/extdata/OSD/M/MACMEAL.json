  "OVERVIEW": "The Macmeal series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium from igneous and metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on mountains, hills alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 60  percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
