  "OVERVIEW": "The Milligan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from quartzitic sandstone and related rock.  Milligan soils are on metastable talus slopes and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid to 18 inches and very rapid below this depth.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
