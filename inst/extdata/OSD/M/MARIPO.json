    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maripo soils are on nearly level to gently sloping flood plains at elevations of 300 to 2500 feet.  Slopes are dominantly 0 to 1 percent but range to 3 percent.  These soils formed in stratified stream alluvium.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 2 to 10 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days.  Precipitation falls as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains."

Antho and Gilman are moderately coarse textured throughout.  Brios, Carrizo and Vint soils are sandy throughout.  Glenbar soils are fine- silty.  Mohall soils are on slightly higher positions and have argillic horizons."

Irrigated areas are used for growing cotton, grain sorghum, small grains, alfalfa and vegetables.  Native vegetation is creosotebush, triangle bursage, cacti, littleleaf paloverde, ironwood and annual grasses and weeds."
