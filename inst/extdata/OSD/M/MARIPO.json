  "OVERVIEW": "The Maripo series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in recent stratified stream alluvium.  Maripo soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",

These soils formed in stratified stream alluvium.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 2 to 10 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days.  Precipitation falls as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains."

Antho and Gilman are moderately coarse textured throughout.  Brios, Carrizo and Vint soils are sandy throughout.  Glenbar soils are fine- silty.  Mohall soils are on slightly higher positions and have argillic horizons."
