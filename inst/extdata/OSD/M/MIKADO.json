  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mikado series consists of very deep somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glacial till on ground moraines. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very slow in the middle part and moderately slow in the lower part. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
