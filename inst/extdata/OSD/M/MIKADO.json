  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Closely related soils are the Iosco, Glennie (T), Riggsville and Selfridge soils. Iosco and Riggsville soils do not have a fragipan, contain more sand in the upper subsoil and have a spodic horizon. Glennie soils are moderately well drained and well drained and are on higher positions on the landscape. Selfridge soils are from a mesic temperature regime."
