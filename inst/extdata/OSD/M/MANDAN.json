  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to over 35 inches in thickness and commonly includes the Bw horizon.  Depth to carbonates commonly is 8 to 18 inches, but some pedons contain carbonates at depths of 0 to 40 inches.  Some pedons have an Ab horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is silt loam and neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam and neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam and slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a 2Bk horizon.\nThe C and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  The C horizon is silt loam.  Below a depth of 40 inches the 2C horizon, where present, is loam glacial till or fine sandy loam, sand or gravelly sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other competing series in the family.  Other competing series are the Bryant, Grassna, Linton, Temvik and Wilton series.  Bryant, Grassna, Temvik and Wilton soils are fine-silty.   Linton soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mandan soils are on level to moderately steep terraces and uplands that are mantled with silty sediments near the Missouri River.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  The silty sediments range from 40 inches to 20 feet in thickness.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches, most of which falls from April through September."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Grassna, Linton and Temvik on nearby silty covered uplands and terraces and the Cabba, Lambert, Lehr, Manning, Parshall, Stady, Wabek and Werner soils.  Cabba, Lambert, Wabek and Werner soils are on steep hills and terrace edges.  Cabba and Werner soils are shallow.  Lambert soils do not have mollic epipedons and Wabek soils are sandy-skeletal.  Lehr, Manning, Parshall and Stady soils are on nearby terraces.  Lehr, Manning and Stady soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Parshall soils are coarse-loamy."
