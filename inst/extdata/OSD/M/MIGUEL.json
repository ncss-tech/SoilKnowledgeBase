  "OVERVIEW": "The Miguel series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and/or clayey residuum weathered from sandstone and/or mudstone of Tertiary age. The soils occur on nearly level to moderately sloping, plane to convex low hills on inland, dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
