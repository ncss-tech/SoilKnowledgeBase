The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 9 to 20 inches thick. Depth to the calcic horizon is 10 to 31 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.\nAn AB horizon is present in some pedons with color and texture similar to the A horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is heavy silt loam or silty clay loam and has 24 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Btk horizon, when present, has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay and is strongly to violently effervescent with segregated lime. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is strongly to violently effervescent. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 0 to 10 percent fine gravel. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The amount of calcium carbonate equivalent needs to be determined to verify if this series has over 15 percent calcium carbonate, or if it only has identifiable secondary carbonates.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
