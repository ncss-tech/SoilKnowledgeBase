  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Maguayo series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on alluvial fans of the Semiarid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in material that weathered from volcanic rocks and limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 29 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.",
