    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In places, especially at greater elevations, a thin dark A1 horizon is present in place of the A2 horizon.  The B horizon ranges in thickness from 2 to 6 inches and in hue from 7.5YR to 2.5YR.  The underlying rock may be shale, slate, or schist.  The ground surface is hummocky, with bare \"frost scars\".  Hard bedrock may occur at 10 to 20 inches, and outcrops in places."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Cytex series of the same subgroup, the Talkeetna, Red Devil, Althouse, and St. Nicholas series of the same great group, and the Aniak series.  The Cytex soils are sandy in both solum and substratum.  The Talkeetna soils have dark reddish brown silty spodic horizons, and sola are thicker than in the McCally soils.  The Red Devil soils do not have permafrost.  The Althouse soils have thin dark A1 horizons are lack permafrost.  The St. Nicholas soils have gravelly dark reddish brown spodic horizons, and lack permafrost.  The Aniak soils lack a spodic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The McCally soils occur on ridges above tree line in interior and western Alaska.  The regolith consists of loess mixed with weathered shale, slate, or schist.  The climate is subarctic with long cold winters and short summers.  The mean annual precipitation is unknown, but probably exceeds 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the Aniak series, these include the well drained McGrath, Napamute, Koyukuk, and Kaltag series and the poorly drained Kuskokwin series.  The well drained soils are formed in deep loess and have no permafrost.  The Kuskokwia soils have a shallow permafrost table.  The Aniak soils commonly occur at still higher elevations then the McCally soils."
