  "OVERVIEW": "The Mahogany series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from black slate. These soils are on mountain slopes and scarp slopes. Slopes are 4 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 425 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1.0 degree C.",
