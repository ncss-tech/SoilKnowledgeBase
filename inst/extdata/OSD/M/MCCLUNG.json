Rock fragments consist mainly of angular sandstone and chert gravel. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid in the A and E horizons and extremely acid through strongly acid in the BE, B, and C horizons.\nThe A horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It ranges from 0 to 3 inches thick.\nThe Ap horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. It ranges from 0 to 10 inches thick.\nThe E horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE or Bw horizon (where present) has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Combined thickness of all A, E, BE, and Bw horizons is less than 60 inches.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; with or without soft masses of rotted rock fragments in shades of brown, yellow, or red. It is loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction in the upper part; and sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay in the lower parts.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; with or without soft masses of rotted rock fragments in shades of brown, yellow, or red.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cottonbend, Egyptgrove (T), Escatawba, Fanchon, Nolichucky, Taterhill, Topazmill (T), Trimble, and Wyrick series. The Brockett and Claiborne series are in a similar family. Cottonbend soils are siltier in the subsoil and contain rounded fragments of mixed lithologies.  Egyptgrove, Escatawba, Fanchon, Taterhill, Topazmill, and Wyrick soils all require at least one lithologic discontinuity in the series control section.  Nolichucky soils are redder and contain rounded fragments in the subsoil.  Trimble soils contain more chert and are siltier in the subsoil. Brocket soils have pockets of uncoated sand in the lower Bt horizon.  Claiborne soils are siltier and contain more clay in the lower Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McClung soils are on uplands of mountains and ridges. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. The soils developed in weathered residuum from sandstone of the Oriskany (Ridgeley) sandstone, and from interbedded sandstones and limestones of the Helderberg group. Elevation ranges from 1200 to 3500 feet. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 55 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches. Frost free period is 145 to 190 days."

Clymer, Lily, and Wallen soils are shallower to bedrock. In addition, Wallen soils are skeletal. Elliber soils are skeletal and contain mostly chert fragments. Oriskany, Murrill, and Escatawba soils formed in colluvial sediments. In addition, Oriskany soils are skeletal."

The overstory in most areas consists mainly of white oak, black oak, and scarlet oak, with smaller amounts of chestnut oak, red oak, hickory, yellow poplar, Virginia pine, and white pine. The understory in undisturbed areas consists mainly of laurel, huckleberry, wild azalea, white pine, dogwood, sassafras, black locust, black gum, wild grape, and red maple."
