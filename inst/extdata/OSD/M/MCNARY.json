  "OVERVIEW": "The McNary series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from basalt or basaltic cinders.  McNary soils are on plateaus and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
