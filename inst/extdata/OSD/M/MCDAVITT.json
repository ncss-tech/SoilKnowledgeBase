  "OVERVIEW": "The McDavitt series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in loamy over clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are in concave positions on glacial lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters.",
