    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are the Aido, Alo, Altamont, Auld, Bosanko, Cibo, Cropley, Diablo, Fiale, Filiorum, Myers, Porterville, Sehorn, and Vaquero series. Aido soils (MLRA 15) do not have strongly expressed intersecting slickensides and have cracks that close for less than 120 consecutive days. Alo soils (MLRA 15, 20) are on mountains and are not calcareous in the upper 30 to 50 cm. Bosanko soils (MLRA 20) have a paralithic contact of weathered igneous rock and their subsurface horizons with slickensides lack carbonates. Altamont (MLRA 15, 20), Auld (MLRA 19, 20) and Diablo soils (MLRA 15, 20) have paralithic contact greater than 100 cm deep. The Cropley (MLRA 14, 19), Myers (MLRA 17) and Porterville soils (MLRA 17, 18, 20) formed in alluvium and lack a paralithic contact. Cibo (MLRA 15, 18, 20), Filiorum (MLRA 15), and Sehorn soils (MLRA 15) have a lithic contact. Fiale soils (MLRA 15) lack carbonates. Vaquero soils (MLRA 15) soils do not have carbonates in all subsoil horizons and have soil colors with exclusively 10YR hues."
