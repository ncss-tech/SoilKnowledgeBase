    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon--0 to 20 cm (A)\n1.1  Organic carbon content ranges from 1 to 5 percent but dry color values are 6 (Walkley-Black digestion method).\n1.2  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 40 percent (calcium carboante percent by field kit).\n2.  Argillic horizon--20 to 117 cm (BAt, Btk, Btkg, Btg, BCtg).\n2.1 Clay content increase greater than 1.2 times that of A horizon (hydrometer method).\n2.2 Common faint and distinct clay films on peds and in pores.\n2.3 Strong and moderate medium and coarse subangular blocky structure (no evidence of prismatic or columnar structure in control section).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nOTHER SOIL CHARACTERISTICS:\n1.  Aquic Subgroup\n1.1 Water table at 102 to 152 cm from February 1 through May 15.\n1.2 Gleyed colors and mottles below 61 cm.\n2. Mesic temperature regime -- MAST 12.8 to 14.4 degrees C; high water table cools the soil, air temperature would indicate a thermic temperature regime, this and other climatic characteristics are from available local climatic data and preliminary SCS data.\n3.  Mineralogy -- assumed mixed, no indication otherwise.\n4.  Particle size class -- fine-loamy based on hydrometer and field estimate of 43 to 94 cm control section.\n5.  Xeric moisture regime -- assumption based on vegetation indicators and preliminary SCS moisture data.\n5.1   The MCS is dry throughout from September 1 to December 1.  It is moist throughout from January 15 to July 15.\n5.2   The soil temperature exceeds 5 degrees C. January 1 to December 31 (365 days).  Within this time period, the MCS is moist in some parts from February 1 to September 1 and from December 1 to January 1 (240 days).\n5.3 The soil temperature exceeds 8.3 degrees C. from March 1 to December 1.  Within this time period, the MCS is moist in some part from March 1 to September 1 (180 days).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was sampled in July, 1986 for characterization at the NSSL.
