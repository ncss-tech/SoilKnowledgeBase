  "OVERVIEW": "The Moyina series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in diatomaceous sediments over organic materials over ash and pumice. They are in marshes in depressional areas of lava plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 32 to 35 degrees F. The soils are wet throughout in most years through spring and early summer with chroma, moist, of 2 or less throughout. Depth to the pumice and ash ranges from 40 to 72 inches. Depth to the organic layer ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The silty upper part of the soil has estimated bulk density of 0.4 to 0.6 gm/cc and is diatomaceous earth.  Some pedons have an O horizon up to 4 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of neutral and 10YR, value of 1 or 2 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 0 or 1 moist or dry. It is diatomaceous silt or mucky diatomaceous silt. The n value is assumed to be less than 0.7. It has 0 to 5 percent field estimated clay. Base saturation is 20 to 40 percent by ammonium acetate. It has 7 to 24 percent organic matter.\nThe 2Oe horizon consists of muck, mucky peat or peat. Peat layers have value of 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Muck layers have value of 1 or 2 and chroma of 0 or 1.\nThe 3C horizon has phosphate retention of 10 to 25 percent, 0.2 to 0.4 aluminum plus half the iron and 50 to 90 percent glass. Base saturation is less than 50 percent."

The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. The mean January temperature is 25 to 26 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 57 to 59 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."
