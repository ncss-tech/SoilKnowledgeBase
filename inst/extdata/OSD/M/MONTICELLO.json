Agar, Eakin, Highmore, and Holdrege soils have hue of 10YR or yellower.  Agar and Northdale soils have strong accumulation of carbonates within a depth of 40 inches.  Eakin soils have mottles at a depth of 19 to 30 inches.  Northdale soils are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Paka soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower and have silty clay loam or silt loam argillic horizons and a paralithic contact at 48 inches. In addition Agar, Eakin, Fairlo, Highmore, Holdredge and Paka soils are in LRR-G and are moist in May and June."

These soils formed in eolian deposits derived mainly from sandstone.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
