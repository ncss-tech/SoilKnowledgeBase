  "OVERVIEW": "The Monticello series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits derived mainly from sandstone.  Monticello soils are on undulating to rolling uplands and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Eakin soils have mottles at a depth of 19 to 30 inches.  Northdale soils are less than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Paka soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower and have silty clay loam or silt loam argillic horizons and a paralithic contact at 48 inches.
