It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is very dark grayish brown, through dark olive hues of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chromas of 2 through 4.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline."

The Aguadilla, Catano, and Espinal soils have udic moisture regimes.  The Arenales soils have well graded soil materials in the control section consisting of silts, coarse sand, and gravel.  The Falfurrias soils have more than 9 degrees F., difference between mean summer and mean winter temperatures.  The Jaucas soils have carbonatic mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Meros soils occur on nearly level benches along the coast at elevations slightly above sea level.  Slope gradients are 0 to 2 percent.  The soil formed in sandy sediments derived from sand sized volcanic fragments, sea shells, and corals.  The climate is semiarid tropical.  The average yearly precipitation is 35 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 79degrees F."
