  "OVERVIEW": "The Mingus series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, well drained soils formed in mixed fan alluvium.  Mingus soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
