(4 to 20 inches thick)\n2Ac3--16 to 30 inches; grayish brown (10YR 5/2) extremely stony ashy coarse sandy loam, very dark brown (10YR 2/2) moist; weak coarse subangular blocky structure; soft, very friable, non-sticky and non-plastic; common very fine roots, few fine roots; many fine interstitial pores; 5 percent gravel, 40 percent cobbles, 40 percent stones and boulders; common fine and medium brown (7.5YR 4/3) iron-manganese nodules in matrix, distinct dark gray (10YR 4/1) moist; many fine prominent black (2.5Y 2.5/1) manganese nodules in matrix, faint black (2.5Y 2.5/1) moist; few fine prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) iron masses in matrix, absent moist and freshly exposed, prominent brown (7.5YR 4/4) dried and remoistened; slightly acid (pH 6.4).  Based on landscape position and parent material, it is assumed this horizon extends to a depth of over 60 inches."
