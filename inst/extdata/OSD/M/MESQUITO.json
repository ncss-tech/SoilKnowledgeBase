  "OVERVIEW": "The Mesquito series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on narrow flood plains of a lava plateau.  These soils formed in alluvium from pumice over colluvium from basalt.  Slopes are 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
