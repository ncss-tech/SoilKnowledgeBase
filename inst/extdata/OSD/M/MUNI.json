  "OVERVIEW": "The Muni series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic and siliceous sedimentary rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Muni soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
