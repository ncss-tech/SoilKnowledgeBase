    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar series with a superactive cation-exchange activity class include the Akeley, Andrusia, Braham, DeMontreville, Leaflake, and Redeye series. None of these soils have lamellae within the series control section. Akeley soils have loamy lacustrine materials in the lower part of the series control section. Andrusia soils have carbonates within 150 cm of the mineral soil surface. Braham, DeMontreville, Leaflake, and Redeye soils have loamy till materials in the lower part of the series control section."

Slopes are dominantly 2 to 18 percent but range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 700 to 920 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees C. Frost-free period is 90 to 180 days."

The somewhat excessively drained Graycalm and Kalkaska, and the excessively drained Rubicon soils are on similar and landform positions and slight rises and do not have argillic horizons. The well drained Hodenpyl and well drained and moderately well drained Isabella soils are on similar landform positions and have loamy materials within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface. The somewhat excessively drained Mancelona soils are on similar landform positions and have average rock fragment contents greater than 35 percent in the lower part of the series control section. The well drained and moderately well drained McBride soils are in slight depressions and have a fragipan. The well drained Menominee soils are in slight depressions and have a lithologic discontinuity within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface."
