    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  Solum thickness is 35 to 60 inches.  The soil is usually moist but is dry for less than 45 consecutive days in the summer.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are at a depth of 26 to 36 inches.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  Stratified gravelly alluvial material is commonly below 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 6 to 8 moist and dry.  Redox concentrations have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 4 to 8 moist and dry.  Redox concentrations have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nCOMPETING SERIES.  This is the Cumley series.  Cumley soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the lower part of the argillic horizon and have moist chroma of 3 or 4 in the Bt horizon."

Slopes are dominantly 8 to 15 percent but range from 0 to 30 percent.  Elevation is 100 to 800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches, mean annual temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 145 to 240 days."

Chismore soils are on adjacent low stream terraces and are mottled above 20 inches.  Dement, Etelka, and Meda soils occur on adjacent uplands.  Dement, Eilertson and Meda are well drained.  Etelka soils lack an argillic horizon.  Pyburn soils are on adjacent low stream terraces and are poorly drained."
