Organic surface horizons may be strongly acid.\nOther Soil Features: The Bhs and/or Bs horizons have spodic properties.  However, the spodic properties are not strongly expressed and the horizons do not meet the requirements of a spodic horizon.\nIn many pedons, the horizons in the upper part of the solum have been mixed by trees throws, soil creep, or a combination of these processes. The upper solum commonly contains mixed or combined horizons and horizons with broken or irregular boundaries.\nRange of Individual Horizons:\nO horizon (if present): in wooded areas, an organic horizon in various stages of decomposition is usually present. This horizon is mainly derived from the leaf litter of northern hardwood trees. Combined thickness of the O horizon is 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches).\nA horizon:\nColor--hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nTexture (fine-earth fraction) - silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or loam.\nOther features - this horizon may be highly organic.\nE horizon (if present):\nColor--hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nTexture (fine-earth fraction) - silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or loam.\nBhs horizon (if present):\nColor--hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3.\nTexture (fine-earth fraction) - silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or loam\nOther features - this horizon may be weakly smeary\nBs horizon:\nColor--hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.\nTexture (fine-earth fraction) - silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or loam.\nOther features - this horizon may be weakly smeary\nBw horizon:\nColor--hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.\nTexture (fine-earth fraction) - silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or loam.\nBC or C horizon (if present):\nColor--hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.\nTexture (fine-earth fraction) - silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam."
