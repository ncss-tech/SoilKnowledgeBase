  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness typically is 24 to 36 inches and ranges from about 20 to 40 inches. Loess silty alluvium ranges from 0 to 20 inches thick. The solum ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the lower part. The substratum is strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and neutral to slightly alkaline in the lower part. Depth to carbonates ranges from 40 to greater than 60 inches. Coarse fragments are lacking in the pedon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 4. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with similar hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap or A horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is stratified clay to silty clay loam and very thin strata of coarser textures are common. Average clay content in the Bt horizons typically is 40 to 50 percent, but ranges from 35 to 60 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 or it is variegated with these colors. It is stratified clay to silt loam and very thin strata of coarser textures are common."

Aaron, Morrisville and Useful soils have a lithic contact at depths within 60 inches. Alsup, Derinda and Ebal soils have a paralithic contact at depths within 60 inches. Brookside, Shircliff, and Vincent soils have a solum greater than 40 inches thick. Gunlock soils have horizons with fragic characteristics at depths of 20 to 34 inches and have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Losantville soils have a solum less than 20 inches thick and have carbonates above a depth of 20 inches. Miamian, Purdin, and Winnegan soils have free carbonates at depths less than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Medary soils are on high river or stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. They formed primarily in silty clay or clay slack water or glacial lacustrine deposits with a thin mantle of loess or silty alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F. Frost-free period ranges from 135 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 600 to 800 feet."
