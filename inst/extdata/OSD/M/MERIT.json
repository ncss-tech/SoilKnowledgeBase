  "OVERVIEW": "The Merit series consists of very deep, well drained soils which are moderately deep to siliceous sand.  They formed in silty alluvium over loamy alluvium underlain typically by siliceous sandy alluvium on stream terraces and pediments.  Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy mantle and moderate to moderately rapid in the stratified sandy substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent and ranges to 45 percent on risers. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Depth to siliceous sandy alluvium range from 24 to 40 inches.  The sandy alluvium or residuum has less than 10 percent weatherable minerals.  The upper part of the particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and from 15 to 45 percent fine sand or coarser.  Typically these soils have no coarse fragments but sandstone gravel or channers are in some pedons.  Volume of sandstone gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 3.  It is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 3 or 4.\nThe 2Bt horizon has colors like the Bt horizon described above.  It is typically loam at least in the upper part but grades to sandy clay loam or sandy loam in some pedons.  Transition horizons with less than 18 percent clay are less than 5 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a thin 3Bt or 3BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand or sand.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand or fine sand.  A few thin strata of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand are in the 3C horizon in most pedons."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1,100 feet."

The moderately well drained Merimod soils and the somewhat poorly drained Sooner soils form a drainage sequence with Merit soils."
