    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section typically has 22 to 30 percent clay, but ranges from 18 to 35 percent clay.  It contains 1 to 10 percent by volume rock fragments, and commonly a few boulders.  Stony phases are recognized.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness and may include all or part of the Bw horizon.  Depth to carbonates typically ranges from 10 to 25 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  The lower part of the B horizon may contain some carbonates either disseminated or in masses.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It typically contains 15 to 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Carbonates are disseminated or segregated.  Some pedons have a BC or BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. It is loam or clay loam glacial till.  The C horizon has relict redoximorphic features or is multicolored in some pedons."

Amor soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  Azaar soils have indurated sandstone at 20 to 40 inches.  Coulterg soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Peerless soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments within a depth of 40 inches.  Quigley soils formed in loamy alluvium in intermountain valleys, and the C horizon contains 40 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Rottulee soils have hue of 7.5YR to 10R and have shattered limestone within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Shambo soils formed in stratified alluvium.  Tansem soils do not have rock fragments in the particle size-control section and formed in stream or lacustrine sediments.  Twin Creek soils have hue of 7.5YR to 10R, and formed in red local alluvium."

The soils formed in calcareous loam or clay loam glacial till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 17 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Arnegard and Bowbells soils are in concave fans, swales, and lesser sloping areas.  They have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  In addition, Bowbells soils have argillic horizons.  Parnell and Tonka soils are in kettles and depressions.  They have a fine textured argillic horizon and are more poorly drained.  Williams soils are on less sloping long convex and plane slopes.  They have an argillic horizon.  Zahl soils are on crests of hills and steep slopes, commonly at higher elevations on the landscape.  They do not have a Bw horizon."
