  "OVERVIEW": "The Mahoon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from diatomaceous earth and tuffaceous sedimentary rocks.  Mahoon soils are on hills and tablelands.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is dry in the moisture control section for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  Between the A and Bt horizon there is an absolute clay increase of 15 to 20 percent.  The thickness of the solum and depth to soft bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The linear extensibility between the surface and bedrock is 4.0 to 6.0 centimeters.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 35 percent rock fragments mainly as gravels, and averages 40 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has values of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.   Rock fragment content is 10 to 60 percent and includes gravel and cobbles.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Chroma of 4 and value of 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist occur in the lower part of the Bt.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 35 percent.  It is clay or clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay in the upper part and clay with 40 to 60 percent clay in the lower part.  Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline."
