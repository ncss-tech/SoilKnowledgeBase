  "OVERVIEW": "The Mislatnah series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from serpentinized peridotite or other serpentinized rock types.  Mislatnah soils are on broad ridgetops and side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
