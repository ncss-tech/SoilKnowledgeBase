The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from serpentinized peridotite or other serpentinized rock types.  Elevations are 400 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 210 days."
