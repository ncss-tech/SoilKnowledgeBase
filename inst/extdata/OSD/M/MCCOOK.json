  "OVERVIEW": "The McCook series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in stratified, calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and have slopes that range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 51 centimeters (20 inches) at the type location.",
