  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and thickness of overlying organic material ranges from 18 to 51 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the O horizon and extremely acid to slightly acid in the underlying C horizons. The content of woody fragments, rock fragments, and shell fragments in individual horizons of the particle-size control section ranges from 0 to 2 percent.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3. It is moderately to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture ranges from sand to silt loam. Horizons identified as C horizons (rather than Cg horizons) are considered to have aquic conditions, but do not meet color requirement of value of 4 or more for reduced, depleted, or gleyed matrices."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Maquam soils are on low-energy shorelines, bays, coves, and other subaqueous landforms that receive relatively mild wave action and are not subject to strong currents. They formed in organic soil material overlying sandy to loamy deltaic and lacustrine sediment. Slope is 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 48 degrees F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Alburg soils are formed in silty and clayey lacustrine sediments on low-energy bay bottoms and other low-energy subaqueous landforms. Knightspoint soils are formed in loamy lacustrine and deltaic sediments on mixed-energy subaqueous landforms such as shorelines and littoral zones, stream outlets, and shoals. Shoreham soils are formed in sandy lacustrine and deltaic sediments on high-energy subaqueous landforms that receive relatively strong wave action or are subject to stronger currents, including shorelines and littoral zones, stream outlets, and shoals."
