  "OVERVIEW": "The Maquam series consists of very deep, subaqueous soils that are permanently submerged. They formed in organic soil materials overlying sandy and loamy lacustrine and deltaic sediments along shorelines and littoral zones in freshwater ponds and lakes. Maquam soils are on low-energy shorelines and other subaqueous landforms that receive relatively mild wave action and are not subject to strong currents. Permeability is moderately rapid to rapid in the organic materials over moderate to rapid in the underlying mineral material. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and thickness of overlying organic material ranges from 18 to 51 inches. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the O horizon and extremely acid to slightly acid in the underlying C horizons. The content of woody fragments, rock fragments, and shell fragments in individual horizons of the particle-size control section ranges from 0 to 2 percent.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 3. It is moderately to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture ranges from sand to silt loam. Horizons identified as C horizons (rather than Cg horizons) are considered to have aquic conditions, but do not meet color requirement of value of 4 or more for reduced, depleted, or gleyed matrices."

Knightspoint soils are formed in loamy lacustrine and deltaic sediments on mixed-energy subaqueous landforms such as shorelines and littoral zones, stream outlets, and shoals. Shoreham soils are formed in sandy lacustrine and deltaic sediments on high-energy subaqueous landforms that receive relatively strong wave action or are subject to stronger currents, including shorelines and littoral zones, stream outlets, and shoals."
