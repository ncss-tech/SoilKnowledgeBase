  "OVERVIEW": "The Meredith series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from latite or similar rock.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep alpine hills and ridges above timber line.  Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation at the type location is 890 mm and the mean annual air temperature is minus 3 degrees C.",
