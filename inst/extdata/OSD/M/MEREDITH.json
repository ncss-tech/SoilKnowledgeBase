  "OVERVIEW": "The Meredith series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from latite or similar rock.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep alpine hills and ridges above timber line.  The average annual precipitation at the type location is 35 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 26 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the umbric epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches, thickness of solum ranges from 12 to 24 inches, and depth to the fragmental substratum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon in the umbric eipedon ranges from 1 to 14 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  Base saturation ranges from 30 to 50 percent in the A and upper B2 horizons but increases with increasing depth in some pedons.  The control section has matrix texture of loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 75 percent sand.  It has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments above the C2 horizon and these range\nin size from pebbles to stones.  The mean annual soil temperature is 30 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 46 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from very strongly to strongly acid.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Typically, this horizon has redder hue than either the overlying or underlying horizon.  It ranges from very strongly to slightly acid.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.  In some pedons the C1 horizon is absent and the solum overlies the fragmental substratum."

The soils formed in parent material weathered residually from highly fractured fragmental beds of latite or similar rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 35 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the winter and is mainly in the form of snow.  The mean temperature annual temperature is 26 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 45 degrees F."
