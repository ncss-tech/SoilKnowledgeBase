  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Malpais soils are on alluvial fans and colluvial slopes bordering hills and mountain fronts. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed rocks, mainly basalt, rhyolite and andesite with a small component of loess high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,340 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

The Malpais concept in the Tuscarora Area and Big Smoky Valley area should be checked during updates. The Malpais concept in the Tuscarora area might fit with the concept of the Wiften series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
