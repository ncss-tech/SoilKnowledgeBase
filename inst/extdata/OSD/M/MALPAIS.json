  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Malpais soils are on alluvial fans and colluvial slopes bordering hills and mountain fronts. These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed rocks, mainly basalt, rhyolite and andesite with a small component of loess high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 1,340 to 1,890 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 125 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and part of Bw1 horizon).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 8 to 64 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Bw2 and portions of the Bw1 and Bk horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: The type location was moved to Lyon County in 05/2009 to better reflect the concept of the series. The Malpais concept in the Tuscarora Area and Big Smoky Valley area should be checked during updates. The Malpais concept in the Tuscarora area might fit with the concept of the Wiften series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
