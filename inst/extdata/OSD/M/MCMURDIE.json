  "OVERVIEW": "The McMurdie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments. The McMurdie soils are on lake terraces.  Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 50 degrees F. and the average summer temperature at about 20 inch depth ranges from 64 to 70 degrees F. The soils are not usually dry, but are dry in the 7 to 20 inch section for more than 45 consecutive days.\nThe mollic epipedon is more than 20 inches thick and organic matter decreases regularly or reaches a level less than 0.5 percent within a depth of 50 inches. The combined thickness of the A and Bt horizons range from 24 to 40 inches. The depth to the horizon of carbonate accumulation ranges from 25 to 40 inches. They are neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has weak fine to medium granular structure . This horizon ranges from slightly hard to hard dry, and friable to firm moist.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR color values of 4 through 6 dry, 2 and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 and 3 in the 7.5 and 10YR hues. It is silty clay, clay loam or silty clay loam with more than 35 percent clay.  This horizon is moderate to strong medium prismatic, and moderate to strong medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe Ck and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10 YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 in 7.5YR and 10YR hues.  They range from silty clay loam to sandy loam. The zone of lime accumulation normally begins in the lower B horizons."

The climate is dry subhumid, the average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F., and the average summer temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 130 to 170 days."
