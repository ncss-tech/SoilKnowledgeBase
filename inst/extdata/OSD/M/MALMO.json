(Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons)\nRedoximorphic features: In the zone from 6 inches on down. (All B and C horizons)\nVertic features: The presence of more than 35 clay at 6 to 43 inches.  (Bt horizons)\nEpisaturation: The zone of saturation at 12 to 36 inches. (Bt horizons)\nRemarks: These soils were previously mapped as Mayberry, severely eroded.  These soils are assumed to have originally classified as Aquic Argiudolls.  However, because of severe erosion, these soils no longer have a mollic epipedon.  In addition, the part of the soil containing the most clay is now at or near the surface.  These changes have a significant affect on the use and management of these soils.\nlrr=M\ndate: 04/26/99\nincreased slopes to 12 percent due to Gage County update. sag\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
