  "OVERVIEW": "Mysol series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Mysol soils are on lake plains and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
