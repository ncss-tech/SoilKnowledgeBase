Fagan soils have slightly acid or medium acid Bt horizons and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marcum soils are on low terraces and basin rims. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources deposited over unrelated siltstone.  Siltstone is a few inches to many feet thick, is fractured and mottled and is hard in the upper part, but becomes softer with depth.  Elevations are 20 to 80 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F., mean July temperature is 77 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 260 to 280 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The original type location for this series is now under a man made lake.  It was classified as a Pachic Argixeroll; however, it lacked sufficient organic matter to be Pachic.  This is a change in classification.  The new type location represents the concept of the Marcum series.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.  Last revised by state on 2/84.\nThis soil was described as having a siltstone Cr. In Butte County this same layer underlies Loemstone and Boga soils but was not called paralithic material, but a dense substratum layer.  It was crushable and had variable texture.  It would not slake in water so could not be called densic materials which do slake.  The dense substratum was not weathered rock in the classic sense as applied to paralithic materials. The dense substratum may actually have some silica cementation which is not visible with a hand lens or naked eye.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL pedon S77CA-101-024 (taxadjunct)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
