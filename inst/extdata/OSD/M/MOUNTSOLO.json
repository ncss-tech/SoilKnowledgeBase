  "OVERVIEW": "The Mountsolo series consists of very shallow to dense material, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in recent volcanic gravelly mudflows.  Mountsolo soils are on low river terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 70 inches and average annual temperature is about 50 degrees.",

It is moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 3 to 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist or dry.  Texture of the surface layer is variable and ranges from gravelly sand to very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe Cd1 horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist or dry.  It is gravelly sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe Cd2 horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.

Most Mountsolo soils formed in recent volcanic gravelly mudflows from the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens.  These deposits are 5 to 30 feet in depth.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and mild, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 60 to 80 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 200 to 240 days."
