    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The weighted average particle size class in the 10 to 40 inch control section is loamy fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 80 percent.  Pedons often contain buried organic horizons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral and varies irregularly throughout the profile.\nCombined thickness of the O horizons ranges from 0 to 3 inches.\nAn A horizon is present in some pedons.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR, value ranges from 3 to 5 and chroma from 2 to 4.\nThe C horizons are typically stratified sand, gravel and cobble but some pedons contain strata of fine sand or loamy sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Malmesbury soils occur on floodplains and are typically in long narrow units contiguous to large stream channels. They have formed in alluvium of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation of about 100 inches and mean annual air temperature of about 45 degrees F.  Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 300 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chilkoot, Tonowek, and Anan soils.  Chilkoot soils are on slightly lower positions and have impeded drainage.  Tonowek soils are on similar positions and have finer surface textures.  Anan soils are in depressional areas of floodplains and are poorly and very poorly drained."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Malmesbury soils are used for watershed protection, wildlife habitat, and recreation.  Principal trees are the Sitka spruce, black cottonwood, and alder.  The understory vegetation is dominantly salmonberry, devil's club, black currant, elderberry, and a variety of forbs."
