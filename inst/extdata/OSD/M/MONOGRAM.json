Depth to calcareous material ranges from 6 to 26 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume throughout the particle-size control section and upper part of the C horizon and are small pebbles.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  The solum with the Bk horizon ranges from 22 to 40 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent and silt from 40 to 75 percent with a high fraction of coarse silt or very fine sand.  It has less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe Bk and 2Bk horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.
