  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Meland soils are on benches, canyon breaks, shoulder slopes and side slopes of mountains and hills.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  They formed in loess and silty alluvium over material weathered from basalt and related basic igneous rock.  They occur at elevations of 1,500 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is cool, semiarid, with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average January temperature is 27 degrees F, average July temperature is 66 degrees F.  The average annual temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost free season is 80 to 180 days.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 26 inches."
