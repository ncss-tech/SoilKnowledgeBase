  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of mineral soil over bedrock ranges from 25 to 50 cm.  Texture is silt loam, loam and very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.   Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent by volume.  Stones and boulders cover from 0 to 15 percent of the surface.  Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure. Some pedons have an Oe horizon.\nSome areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR and with value and chroma of 3 or 4.  The A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  They have weak or moderate, very fine or fine granular structure.\nThe E horizon is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 0 to 2.  It has weak very fine to medium granular or weak very thin platy structure.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 4.  The Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, with value and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8.  The value ranges to 3 in some near surface subhorizons in some pedons.  The B horizon has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular, or very fine or fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It has weak very fine or fine granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe bedrock is typically slate, metasandstone, phyllite or schist."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Amadon, Creasey, and Lyman series. Amadon soils have more than 50 percent fine sand or coarser throughout the series control section and developed over limestone.  Creasey soils have less than 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section and developed over reddish sandstone and conglomerate.  Lyman soils have less than 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Monson soils are on knolls of till plains and on hills, ridges and mountains.  Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in a shallow mantle of glacial till derived principally from slate, metasandstone, phyllite or schist.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1168 mm.  The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 91 to 762 m above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Chesuncook, poorly drained Monarda, and somewhat poorly drained Telos soils are all very deep to bedrock soils at lower elevations on the landscape.  Elliottsville soils are well drained and moderately deep to bedrock."
