(A1 and A2 horizons)\nRedoximorphic features:  The presence of redox concentrations and redox depletions from 8 to 60 inches.\nEndosaturation:  The presence of a saturated zone from 0 to 1.5 feet during the months of January to December.\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data from similar soils in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nThis soil is at elevations typically associated with mesic temperature regimes, however, because of cool air drainage off of nearby mountains and the influence of cold mountain water it was placed in a frigid temperature regime.\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
