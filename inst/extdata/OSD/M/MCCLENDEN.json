Adkins soils lack carbonate accumulations above 24 inches.  Bijorja soils have a paralithic contact above 40 inches.  Chedehap, Haybourne, and Scooteney soils have sandy 2C horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Scooteney soils also have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle size control section.  Drewsey soils have carbonates at a depth of 20 to 35 inches.  Clems and Haybourne lack carbonates above 45 inches.  Prosser and Vining soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Irrigon and Wiehl soils have a Cr horizon at 20 to 40 inches.  Kecko, Rebel and Royal soils have moderately rapid permeability.  Rebel soils also have greater than 50 percent sand in the particle size control section.  Royal soils are stratified fine sandy loam and loamy fine sand in the particle size control section. Sohappy soils have depth to carbonates of 24 to 44 inches and have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 56 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McClenden soils are in depressional areas on basalt plains and on fan terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The soil formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Elevation ranges from 4,250 to 5,400 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 to 12 inches.  The average annual air temperature is about 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."
