The soil between the depths of 14 to 26 inches is usually dry in all parts for 90 to 150 days from June to early November and is moist in some or all parts all of the rest of the year.  Average base saturation throughout the soil is 15 to 50 percent.  The soil is sandy loam or loam throughout and may be gravelly or cobbly.   Rock fragments average greater than 35 percent from 10 inches to the bedrock.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/2, 4/3, 3/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/4, 4/2, 3/4 or 3/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 2/2, 3/2; 5YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  It has up to 15 percent organic matter in the upper few inches and more than 2 percent to a depth of 10 inches.  It has 15 to 35 percent gravel and 2 to 25 percent cobbles and stones.  It is slightly to medium acid.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4; 7.5YR 6/6, 5/6, 4/6, 5/4, 4/4; 5YR 5/6, 4/6 or 4/4.

Elevation is 2,000 to 6,000 feet. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation varies from 35 to 70 inches.  Snowfall is 10 to 100 inches.  Mean January temperature is 35 degrees F; mean July temperature is 70 degrees F; mean annual temperature varies from 50 to 58 degrees F.   Frost-free season is about 130 to 225 days."

One pedon in Amador County without andic tests: S62CA-005-001. A McCarthy pedon sampled near type location in 1991:S91CA-017-001 meets series criteria and two NSSL pedons S90CA-109-122 and 124 in Tuolumne County.\nSeries reclassified 10/96 according to Amendment 18.  Competing series not updated at that time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
