  "OVERVIEW": "The McCarthy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from andesitic mudflows.  McCarthy soils are on gently sloping to very steep slopes of dissected plateau-like areas.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.",

The soil between the depths of 14 to 26 inches is usually dry in all parts for 90 to 150 days from June to early November and is moist in some or all parts all of the rest of the year.  Average base saturation throughout the soil is 15 to 50 percent.  The soil is sandy loam or loam throughout and may be gravelly or cobbly.  Rock fragments average greater than 35 percent from 10 inches to the bedrock.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 4/2, 4/3, 3/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 4/4, 4/2, 3/4 or 3/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 2/2, 3/2; 5YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  It has up to 15 percent organic matter in the upper few inches and more than 2 percent to a depth of 10 inches.  It has 15 to 35 percent gravel and 2 to 25 percent cobbles and stones.  It is slightly to medium acid.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/4; 7.5YR 6/6, 5/6, 4/6, 5/4, 4/4; 5YR 5/6, 4/6 or 4/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 3/4, 3/3, 3/2; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 3/2, 3/4; 5YR 4/4, 3/4.  It has 35 to 75 percent gravel and cobbles with stones in some pedons.  It is medium to strongly acid."

One pedon in Amador County without andic tests: S62CA-005-001. A McCarthy pedon sampled near type location in 1991:S91CA-017-001 meets series criteria and two NSSL pedons S90CA-109-122 and 124 in Tuolumne County.\nSeries reclassified 10/96 according to Amendment 18.  Competing series not updated at that time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
