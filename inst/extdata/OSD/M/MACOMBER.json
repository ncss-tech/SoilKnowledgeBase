  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments are mainly phyllite, slate, schist, and quartz with content ranging in volume from 10 to 35 percent in the A horizon, 30 to 60 percent in the B horizon, and from 40 to 65 percent in the C horizon, averaging 35 percent or more throughout the series control section.  Up to 15 percent of the surface may be covered with flagstones, stones and boulders.  Unless limed, the reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid in the A horizon and strongly acid or very strongly acid in the Bw and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate, very fine, fine or medium granular structure and very friable or friable consistence.\nThe upper part of Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The lower part has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, with value and chroma ranges the same as the upper part. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky structure.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with properties similar to the lower part of the Bw and C.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  It has platy or angular blocky structure or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is very friable to firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Knapp Creek, Lagross, Mandy, Mosinee, and Rockrift series. Knapp Creek, Lagross and Mosinee soils have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches. Mandy soils formed in residuum derived from acid siltstone and shale. Rockrift soils are very deep and formed in till and local colluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Macomber soils are on bedrock controlled, glacially modified land forms where the till is derived mainly from strongly folded phyllite, schist, quartzite, and slate.  Slope ranges from 3 to 80 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches and mean annual frost-free season ranges from 90 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from about 1000 to 2100 feet."

Bernardston and Pittstown soils are very deep and have dense substrata.  Hoosic, Quonset and Warwick soils are mesic and formed in outwash material.  Manlius and Nassau soils are mesic.  Taconic soils are shallow to phyllite and slate bedrock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The concept of Macomber series as originally described in the 1937 Rensselaer County Soil Survey, was a coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid, Typic Haplorthod.  Available laboratory data on other soils in the region did not support the existence of spodosols so the classification was changed.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 3 inches (A horizon).\n2.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 23 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nSoil Interpretation Records: NY0281, NY0321\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
