The soils are strongly or very strongly alkaline in a majority of subhorizons in the control section.  The control section averages 0 to 5 percent gypsum and does not exceed 3 percent gypsum in a majority of subhorizons above 24 inches.  Conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos above a depth of 24 inches, but thin, discontinuous subhorizons totaling less than 4 inches in thickness with conductivity exceeding 14 millimhos occur in some pedons.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.  Hue ranges from 5Y through 7.5YR except that in some pedons a few discontinuous subhorizons have hue redder than 7.5YR and occupy less than half the thickness of the control section."

These soils formed in thick, calcareous, stratified alluvial materials derived from a variety of rocks.  At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 8 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 41 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 61 degrees F."
