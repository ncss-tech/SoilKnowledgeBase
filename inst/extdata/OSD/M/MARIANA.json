    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 16 to 33 inches.  The reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 4.  Content of pebbles ranges from 15 to 32 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe AB horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 4 or there is a mix of colors in shades of brown.  Content of pebbles ranges from 10 to 25 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8; or there is no dominant color is and multicolored in shades of yellow, red, brown and gray.  Content of pebbles ranges from 2 to less than 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8; or there is no dominant color is and multicolored in shades of yellow, red, brown and gray.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has no dominant color and is multicolored saprolite in shades of yellow, red, brown, gray and white.  The original rock structure is visible and weathered rock fragments can be easily broken between fingers.  Low chroma colors appear to have been inherited from the parent material and are not thought to be due to wetness.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in residuum that weathered from basalt lava flow and tuff.  This soil is located in a transition zone between the Semiarid Coastal Plains and the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA. Slopes range from 12 to 40 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 79 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 73 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Descalabrado, Jacana and Palmarejo series.  Descalabrado and Jacana soils have mollic epipedons and have Ustic soil moisture regimes.  In addition, Descalabrado soils are shallow to bedrock and Jacana soils have Vertic properties.  The Palmarejo soils are moderately well drained and have an Ustic soil moisture regime."

The classification was updated with the 12/2004 draft from Fine, mixed, active, isohyperthermic Typic Dystrudepts to Fine, mixed active, isohyperthermic Typic Haplohumults due to recognition of Bt horizons and high level of organic carbon between mineral soil surface and a depth of about 40 inches.\nMariana soils are in MLRA 270.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Lajas Municipality, Puerto Rico; S85PR-079-001.  Sample by NSSL, Lincoln, NE., 07/1985.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
