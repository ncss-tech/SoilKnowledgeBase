  "OVERVIEW": "The Mariana series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on summits and side slopes of hills of the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in colluvium and residuum that weathered from basalt lava and tuff.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches.  Slopes range from 12 to 40 percent.",

The reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 4.  Content of pebbles ranges from 15 to 32 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe AB horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 4 or there is a mix of colors in shades of brown.  Content of pebbles ranges from 10 to 25 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8; or there is no dominant color is and multicolored in shades of yellow, red, brown and gray.  Content of pebbles ranges from 2 to less than 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8; or there is no dominant color is and multicolored in shades of yellow, red, brown and gray.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon has no dominant color and is multicolored saprolite in shades of yellow, red, brown, gray and white.  The original rock structure is visible and weathered rock fragments can be easily broken between fingers.  Low chroma colors appear to have been inherited from the parent material and are not thought to be due to wetness.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay."

The classification was updated with the 12/2004 draft from Fine, mixed, active, isohyperthermic Typic Dystrudepts to Fine, mixed active, isohyperthermic Typic Haplohumults due to recognition of Bt horizons and high level of organic carbon between mineral soil surface and a depth of about 40 inches.\nMariana soils are in MLRA 270.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization pedon - Lajas Municipality, Puerto Rico; S85PR-079-001.
