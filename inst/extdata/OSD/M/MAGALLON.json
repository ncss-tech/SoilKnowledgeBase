  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the solum is 14 to 25 inches. Depth to coarse sand ranges from 20 to 35 inches. The upper part of the control section averages more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry..\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. This horizon has weak subangular blocky or weak prismatic structure. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Organic matter is less than one percent.\nThe C horizon ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand and has 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments. The color is variable depending on the amount of basaltic sand. Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Magallon soils are on terraces and their sideslopes. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The soils formed in glacial outwash consisting mainly of sand with mantle of reworked loess and small amounts of volcanic ash. They are at elevations between 400 to 1,700 feet. The annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. These soils occur in a climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters; an average July temperature of 71 degrees F.; an average January temperature of 30 degrees F.; a mean annual temperature of 49 to 53 degrees F.; and a frost-free season of 140 to 190 days."

Farrell soils are coarse-loamy.  Stratford soils have a calcic horizon and have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section."
