The average annual air temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 25 to 45 inches.  The average frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Idamont soils are on mountains and foothills and formed in glacial till and are ashy over loamy.  Katka soils are on south-facing mountain slopes at higher elevations and are cryic.  Pearsoncreek and Treble soils are on mountains and foothills and formed in glacial till and do not have an umbric epipedon.  Jaypeak soils are on north-facing mountain slopes and are ashy over loamy-skeletal."

The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nThe 11/2010 revision reflects a reclassification from Dystroxerepts to Humixerepts greatgroup based on revisions to the 11th Edition Keys to Soil Taxonomy. No other changes were made during this revision.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
