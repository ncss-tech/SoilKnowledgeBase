    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the base of soil development is 51 to 140 cm (20 to 55 inches). Illite is the dominant clay mineral.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap or A horizon) has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Bt or 2Bt horizon) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is silty clay loam or silty clay. The particle-size control section of the Bt horizon averages between 35 and 45 percent clay and contains less than 50 percent clay in any subhorizon. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe lower part of the series control section (BC, 2BC, Cd or 2Cd horizon) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. It is silty clay loam or clay loam. It is slightly to moderately alkaline and commonly contains carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Markham soils are typically in transition areas between the Mollisols and Alfisols on Wisconsin till plains. Slopes are dominantly between 3 and 12 percent, and they range from 0 to 20 percent. The soils are formed in silty clay loam till of Wisconsin Age that has, in some places, mantles of less than 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or other silty material. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F.), mean annual precipitation is 740 to 1020 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost free days is 140 to 180 days, and the elevation ranges from 165 to 311 meters (540 to 1020 feet) above sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ashkum, Beecher, Elliott, Morley, Ozaukee, and Varna soils. The poorly drained Ashkum soils have a mollic epipedon and are lower positions on the landform. The somewhat poorly drained Beecher and Elliott soils are on slightly lower landform positions. Morley, Ozaukee, and Varna soils are also on similar landform positions. Morley and Ozaukee soils have surface layers with moist color values of 4 or more, and Varna soils have mollic epipedons."

The depth to a perched seasonal high water table is 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) at some time during the spring in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second). Permeability is slow."
