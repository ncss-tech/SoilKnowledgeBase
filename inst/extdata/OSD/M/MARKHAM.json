  "OVERVIEW": "The Markham series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on Wisconsin till plains. They formed in a thin layer of loess or silty material and in the underlying silty clay loam till. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

It is silty clay loam or silty clay. The particle-size control section of the Bt horizon averages between 35 and 45 percent clay and contains less than 50 percent clay in any subhorizon. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe lower part of the series control section (BC, 2BC, Cd or 2Cd horizon) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.

Slopes are dominantly between 3 and 12 percent, and they range from 0 to 20 percent. The soils are formed in silty clay loam till of Wisconsin Age that has, in some places, mantles of less than 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or other silty material. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F.), mean annual precipitation is 740 to 1020 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost free days is 140 to 180 days, and the elevation ranges from 165 to 311 meters (540 to 1020 feet) above sea level."

The poorly drained Ashkum soils have a mollic epipedon and are lower positions on the landform. The somewhat poorly drained Beecher and Elliott soils are on slightly lower landform positions. Morley, Ozaukee, and Varna soils are also on similar landform positions. Morley and Ozaukee soils have surface layers with moist color values of 4 or more, and Varna soils have mollic epipedons."
