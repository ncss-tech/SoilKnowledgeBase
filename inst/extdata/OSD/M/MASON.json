  "OVERVIEW": "The Mason series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils that formed in material weathered from silty alluvium of Pleistocene Age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad flood plains in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches).  Mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F.)",

Caspina soils are higher and closer to the river.  Garton soils are slightly lower, have a fine control section and farther from the river.  Muldrow, Pledger, and Roebuck soils are farther from the river in back swamp positions and have a fine control section.  Okay soils occur on terraces and do not have a mollic epipedon more than 51 centimeters (20 inches) thick.  Osage soils have a fine control section.  Radley, Verdigris, and Wynona soils do not contain an argillic horizon."
