The soils formed in silty alluvial materials of Pleistocene Age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1194 mm (32 to 47 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.6 to 17 degrees C (51 to 63 degrees F).  Elevation is 144.8 to 388.6 m (475 to 1275 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite P-E index is 64 to 78."

Caspina soils are higher and closer to the river.  Garton soils are slightly lower, have a fine control section and farther from the river.  Muldrow, Pledger, and Roebuck soils are farther from the river in back swamp positions and have a fine control section.  Okay soils occur on terraces and do not have a mollic epipedon more than 51 centimeters (20 inches) thick.  Osage soils have a fine control section.  Radley, Verdigris, and Wynona soils do not contain an argillic horizon."
