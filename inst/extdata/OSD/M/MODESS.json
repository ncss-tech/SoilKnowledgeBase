  "OVERVIEW": "The Modess series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from granite or other coarse grained igneous or metamorphic rocks.  These soils occur on ridges and bedrock controlled pediments in foothills and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
