These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to the seasonal high water table in spring is 2.0 to 3.0 feet. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to mottles with chroma of 2 or less is 15 to 30 inches.  The particle-size control section is 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Some pedons do not have an A2 horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Monse soils are on stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium overlying lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 750 to 1,400 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 74 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 140 to 180 days."

The Cashmere, Cashmont, Malott, and Okanogan soils are coarse-loamy.  Ellisforde soils are coarse-silty.  Pogue soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Quincy and Skaha soils lack a mollic epipedon.   Strat soils are loamy-skeletal.  In addition, none of the above soils are in an aquic subgroup."
