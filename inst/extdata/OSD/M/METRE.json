  "OVERVIEW": "The Metre series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in clayey residuum weathered from mudstone or shale on uplands.  These soils have very slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R to 5Y, value of 4 to 8 and 3 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4 and reflects the varigated colors of the parent material.  It is clay or silty clay.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is variegated and has color similar to the C horizon.  It is soft mudstone or clayey shale having varying degrees of weathering."
