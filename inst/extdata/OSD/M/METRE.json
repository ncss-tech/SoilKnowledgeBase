The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It contains carbonates when plowed or disturbed.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR or is neutral, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 0 to 4.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon is multicolored and has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8 and 3 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It has few to many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonates.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R to 5Y, value of 4 to 8 and 3 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4 and reflects the varigated colors of the parent material.  It is clay or silty clay.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is variegated and has color similar to the C horizon.  It is soft mudstone or clayey shale having varying degrees of weathering."
