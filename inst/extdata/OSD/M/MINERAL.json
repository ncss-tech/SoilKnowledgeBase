  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mineral series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum, colluvium, and glacial till from granitic rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  Mineral soils are on mountainsides and ridges and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 535 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Buhrig soils are on mountain slopes and knobs.  Canteen soils are on footslopes and backslopes of mountains.  Manley soils are on upper slopes of foothills and mountains.  Nevine and Stepstone soils are on moraines, foothills and mountains.  Capoose soils have a volcanic ash mantle greater than 36 cm thick.  Centralpeak soils are coarse-loamy and have a volcanic ash mantle 18 to 36 cm thick.   Skanid and Vanbrunt soils have a mesic soil temperature regime.  Merkel and Skanid soils are on mountains.  Capoose, Centralpeak, and Vanbrunt soils are on shoulders and backslopes of mountains."
