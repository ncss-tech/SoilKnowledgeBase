    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Martinez soils are on nearly level to gently sloping fans at elevations of 5,000 to 5,800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in old alluvium from rocks such as andesite, quartzite, rhyolite, rhyolitic tuff, and sandstone. The climate is semiarid continental. Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees to 57 degrees F. The frost-free season is 140 to 200 days and annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches of which 50 percent falls as thundershowers in July, August and September, and most of the remainder as gentle winter rains or snows in December, January and February."

Canelo soils are somewhat poorly drained and very gravelly or very cobbly.  Comoro and Pima soils have mollic epipedons and lack an argillic horizon."
