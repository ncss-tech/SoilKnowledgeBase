  "REVDATE": "12/2006",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Martinez series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to sandstone.  These soils formed in old alluvium from rocks such as andesite, quartzite, rhyolite, rhyolitic tuff, and sandstone on nearly level to gently sloping fans.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about degrees 55 F.",

These soils formed in old alluvium from rocks such as andesite, quartzite, rhyolite, rhyolitic tuff, and sandstone. The climate is semiarid continental. Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees to 57 degrees F. The frost-free season is 140 to 200 days and annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches of which 50 percent falls as thundershowers in July, August and September, and most of the remainder as gentle winter rains or snows in December, January and February."
