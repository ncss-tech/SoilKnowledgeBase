  "OVERVIEW": "The Momoli series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in fan alluvium and eolian deposits.  Momoli soils are on stream terraces and fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 73 degrees F.",

Chillon soils receive more than 10 inches average annual precipitation, and do not receive significant amounts of moisture during the winter months, typical of the Chihuahuan Desert (MLRA 42). Laposa soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Snapcan soils have fanglomerate at moderate depths and are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September."
