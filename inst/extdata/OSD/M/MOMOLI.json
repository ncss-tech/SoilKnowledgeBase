  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chillon (T)(TX), Laposa (AZ), and Snapcan (AZ) series.  Chillon soils receive more than 10 inches average annual precipitation, and do not receive significant amounts of moisture during the winter months, typical of the Chihuahuan Desert (MLRA 42). Laposa soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Snapcan soils have fanglomerate at moderate depths and are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September."

Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains.  Mean annual air temperature is 69 to 75 degrees F.
