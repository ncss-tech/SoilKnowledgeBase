  "OVERVIEW": "The Mummy series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss and schist.  Mummy soils are on mountains.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
