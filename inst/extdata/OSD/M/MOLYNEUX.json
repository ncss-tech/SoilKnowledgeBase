  "OVERVIEW": "The Molyneux series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium from mixed sources.  Molyneux soils are on fan terraces, basalt plains, canyon sides, and foothills and have slopes of 2 to 35 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
