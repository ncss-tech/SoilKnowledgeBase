Elkcreek and Mojo soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Johnson and Trojan soils have hues of 7.5YR and 5YR in the argillic horizon.  Muldon soils have less thank 30 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 5 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Skelter soils have stratified alluvium in the lower part of the particle-size control section and have strongly or extremely acid reaction in the lower part of the series control section.  Trojan soils have an 0 horizon, and are dry more than 80 consecutive days.  Suloaf soils have bedrock between 40 and 60 inches.  Simonton soils have a solum that is 30 to 40 inches thick.  Lidos soils have an 0 horizon and are slightly acid to strongly acid throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Molyneux soils are on fan terraces, basalt plains, canyon sides, and foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,800 to 6,000 feet.  The soil formed in alluvium and colluvium from mixed sources.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rain.  The average annual temperature is about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
