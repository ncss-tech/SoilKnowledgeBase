  "OVERVIEW": "The Marriott series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Marriott soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe soil is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout. The Al horizon has hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. The A horizon is gravelly sandy loam or cobbly sandy loam. It is commonly noncalcareous but soils having slightly calcareous A horizons are within the range of the series. Content of pebbles and cobbles ranges from 15 to 40 percent by volume. Content of organic matter ranges from 1 to 2.5 percent.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages gravelly fine sandy loam in texture and it contains from 20 to 50 percent pebbles and cobbles.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. The Bk horizon ranges in texture from gravelly fine sandy loam to gravelly loamy fine sand.  It contains from 15 to 50 percent coarse fragments mostly pebbles and small cobbles.  The lower part of the horizon is moderately calcareous; calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 10 percent."

These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from quartzite, sandstone, granite, and some limestone.  The climate is dry subhumid and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 19 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees  F., and the frost-free period is 130 to 175 days."
