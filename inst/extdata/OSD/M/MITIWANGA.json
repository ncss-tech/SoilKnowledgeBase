  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments are glacial erratics of mixed lithology.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 (6 or more dry), and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have an A horizon, 1 to 4 inches thick, that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 2. Texture is typically silt loam, but the range includes channery loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Areas that have been limed range to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam, silt loam, or channery loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid. Areas that have been limed range to slightly acid.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is loam, silt loam, or channery loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture commonly is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam, and less commonly their channery analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 30 percent. Reaction commonly is very strongly acid or strongly acid, but ranges to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have BC horizons that range to slightly acid in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has similar color range to the B horizon. Texture is clay loam, loam, sandy loam, or their channery or flaggy analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 25 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have 2BC and 2C horizons derived from sandstone. Color and reaction range is similar to the BC and C horizons, respectively. Texture is channery, very channery, flaggy, or very flaggy analogues of clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 40 percent.\nIn some pedons a few inches of fractured sandstone are above the lithic contact."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ayshire, Capac, Crawleyville (T), Digby, Great Piece, Jimtown, Mongle, Sleeth, and Whitaker series. The Ayshire, Capac, Crawleyville, Digby, Jimtown, Mongle, Sleeth, and Whitaker soils do not have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.\nThe Shadeland series has not been updated to the 8th editions of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy. They may become a competing series when their area of use is updated. The Shadeland soils have the lower part of the series control section derived from interbedded sedimentary bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mitiwanga soils are on flats, shoulders, and back slopes on till plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. They formed in till of Wisconsin age that is moderately deep to sandstone bedrock. Elevations are 570 to 1,300 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 29 to 43 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F. The frost free period is 133 to 198 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This revision shifts the typical pedon within Erie County and updates the series concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na). Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 11 inches (Ap and BE horizon).\nb). Argillic horizon - from a depth of 11 to 25 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nc). Aquic conditions - at a depth of 9 to 25 inches.\nd). Lithic contact - at a depth of 25 inches.\nPhases and variants: A cobbly sandy loam surface texture phase and a moderately well drained variant are recognized. It is anticipated that these phases and other soils correlated as Mitiwanga in MLRA's other than MLRA 139 will be correlated as new series in future modernization projects.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for the typical pedon (ER-46).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
