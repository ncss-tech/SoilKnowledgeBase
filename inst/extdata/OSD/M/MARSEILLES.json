  "OVERVIEW": "The Marseilles series consists well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in a thin layer of loess and the underlying residuum weathered from shale.  These soils are moderately deep to noncalcareous shale.  Some pedons formed entirely in residuum.  Permeability is moderate in the loess and slow in the residuum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches.",

The BE or E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The upper one-third of the control section is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe middle one-third of the control section (Bt horizon that formed in loess) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have chroma of 2 or less below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  The Bt horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam.

Gallipolis soils are very strongly acid or strongly acid in the lower part of the control section and have mean annual precipitation of 39 to 43 inches.  Grays, Throckmorton, and Wingate soils have an ochric epipedon more than 6 inches thick with moist color value of 3.5 or less and have horizons with more than 10 percent sand within a depth of 40 inches.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marseilles soils are on bedrock controlled hills and benches and side slopes of the valleys and incised drainageways in glaciated areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  These soils typically formed in a mantle of loess or other silty material and in brownish and grayish colored residuum weathered from noncalcareous Pennsylvanian shale.  Some pedons formed entirely in residuum.  The loess is dominantly montmorillonitic and the layers formed in residuum weathered from shale are illitic.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F, mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches, frost-free period ranges from 160 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 600 to 1020 feet above sea level."

Atlas soils contain more clay in the control section and formed in till.  Elco soils formed in loess and the underlying till.  Fayette soils formed in loess.  Hickory soils formed in till and contain more sand in the control section.  Loran soils contain mottles with chroma of 2 or less higher in the solum and have a mollic epipedon.  They formed in materials similar to Marseilles soils, but are deeper to the paralithic contact."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  With this revision, the typical pedon is moved from La Salle County to Bureau County.  A new typical pedon was selected to depict a more typical landform position and slope.\nThese soils have a seasonally perched water table on the shale bedrock and water that moves laterally along the surface of the bedrock, but they do not have an aquic moisture regime.\nThe water seeps into these soils at the interface of the overlying loess or till, or along the surface of the shale bedrock or the slowly permeable residuum weathered from shale.  Soils with steep slopes are as likely to have them as soils with lesser slopes.  A well drained phase is recognized for soils without a wetness problem.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 4 inches (A horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 9 to 36 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
