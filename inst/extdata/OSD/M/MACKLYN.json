  "OVERVIEW": "The Macklyn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock.  Macklyn soils are on broad ridgetops of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2794 millimeters (110 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevation is 61 to 396 m.  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 2286 to 3302 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 14 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."
