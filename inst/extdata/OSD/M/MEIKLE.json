  "OVERVIEW": "The Meikle series consists of (maximal) Low Humic Gley soils with some Noncalcic Brown characteristics developed in imperfectly drained basins under forb, grass and sedge vegetation.  The parent material consists of medium to moderately coarse textured granitic alluvium on the same terrace level ad the Hanford soils, mixed to some extent with alluvium or coluvium eroded from areas of Whitney, Rocklin and Cometa soils.  The Meikle series is characterized by a thin, gray sandy clay loam A1 horizon abruptly overlying a blocky clay B horizon which usually contains some lime as the C horizon is approached.  The pH increases from slightly acid at the surface to a much as moderately alkaline in lower B horizon.  The Meikle soils occur in basins formed in drainage ways between hills of Whitney soils, commonly capped by Rocklin and Cometa soils, where the drainage had been blocked by the deposition of granitic alluvium by major streams.  Above these ponded areas are found young or immature alluvial soils of the Greenfield, Snelling, or Exeter series along minor drainage ways.  The soils found on the blocking alluvium are generally of the Hanford or Dinuba series.  The Alamo soils are similar in texture and structure to the Meikle soils but have a strongly cemented hardpan.  The Paulsell soils have a similar profile but are formed from basic igneous alluvium rather than granitic.  The Freeport soils have black surface horizons, are poorly and very poorly drained, and are formed from alluvial material from mixed rock sources.  The Meikle soils occur at elevations ranging from 100 to 250 feet in a semi-arid to subhumid mesothermal climate having a mean annual rainfall of 14 inches with warm to hot dry summers and cool moist winters; an average January temperature of 46 degrees F., an average July temperature of 78 degrees F. with a mean annual temperature of 64 degrees F.  The growing season is about 280 days.  The Meikle soils occur along the eastern side of the north and central portions of the San Joaquin Valley, California and are used for the production of dry farmed grain and range or irrigated pasture.  They are not extensive.",

There is normally no external drainage; the soil is generally covered with water for short periods in the spring of wet years.  The duration of the ponded period in the spring varies with the rainfall and slight variations in elevation within the soil area.  The permeability is very slow, but the substratum is moderately slowly permeable and most areas are usually dry by early summer.  Groundwater level is generally deep."
