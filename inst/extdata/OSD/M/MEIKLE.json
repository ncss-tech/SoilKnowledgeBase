There is normally no external drainage; the soil is generally covered with water for short periods in the spring of wet years.  The duration of the ponded period in the spring varies with the rainfall and slight variations in elevation within the soil area.  The permeability is very slow, but the substratum is moderately slowly permeable and most areas are usually dry by early summer.  Groundwater level is generally deep."
