  "OVERVIEW": "The Maysprings series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and alluvium derived from sandstone.  Maysprings soils are on plateaus, hillsides, and toe slopes.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The particle-size control section is sandy clay loam or sandy loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 27 percent, silt ranges from 5 to 20 percent, and sand ranges from 50 to 75 percent, with greater than 40 percent fine and coarser sand.  The soil is noncalcareous to a depth of 40 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Fine pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is sandy clay loam or sandy loam.  Fine pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is a coarse sand, gravelly coarse sand, or loamy coarse sand. Clay content ranges from 0 to 12 percent.  Content of fine pebbles ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline above a depth of 40 inches and mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline below a depth of 40 inches."
