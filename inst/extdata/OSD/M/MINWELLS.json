  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Minwells series consists of very deep to gravelly loamy alluvium. These well drained soils formed in ancient alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. These gently sloping soils are on high stream terraces of the Brazos River and other major streams.  Slope is dominantly less than 3 percent but ranges from 1 to 5 percent along narrow drainageways. Mean annual precipitation is about 836.7 mm (32.9 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.8 degrees C (65.8 degrees F).",
