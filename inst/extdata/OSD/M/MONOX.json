  "OVERVIEW": "The Monox series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium over lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from igneous rocks.  Monox soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
