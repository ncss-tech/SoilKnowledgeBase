Elevations range from 6,100 to 6,600 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

The cation exchange activity class is estimated based on NASIS property data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to 2 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon- The zone from 6 to 24 inches (Bt and Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 18 to 33 inches (Btk and Bkq horizons).\nDuric feature - The zone from 24 to 33 inches (Bkq horizon).\nMajor lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to sandy-skeletal material at 33 inches (2C horizon).\nA strongly contrasting particle-size class is within a depth of 40 inches.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 6 to 40 inches (Bt, Btk, and Bkq horizons and part of the 2C horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
