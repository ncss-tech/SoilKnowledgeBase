  "OVERVIEW": "The Maybee series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. These soils are on remnant terraces in intermountain valleys and uplands. These soils are subject to prolonged saturation from flood irrigation.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
