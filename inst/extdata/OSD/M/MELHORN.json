  "OVERVIEW": "The Melhorn series consists of very deep, well drained soils on plateaus and mountains. Melhorn soils are formed in volcanic ash and loess overlying colluvial material derived from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
