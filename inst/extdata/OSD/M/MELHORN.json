The soil is formed in volcanic ash and loess overlying colluvial material derived from basalt. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 60 to 110 days."
