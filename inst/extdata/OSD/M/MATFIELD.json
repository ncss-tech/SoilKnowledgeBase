    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 56 centimeters (0 to 22 inches) (A1, A2, A3 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 107 to 157 centimeters (42 to 62 inches) (Bt horizon)\nLithic contact: 157 centimeters (62 inches) (R horizon)\nKeys to Taxonomy: Twelfth Edition, 2014. The previous classification was Clayey-skeletal, smectitic, mesic Pachic Paleustolls.\nAlternate location is in a road cut about 2 miles west of Matfield Green; 1,850 feet southwest of the southeast corner of lot 27, sec. 6, T. 22 S., R. 8 E.\n2/2014 JGA After reviewing the type location tud's, pedons, and lab data, the Bt horizons are described as starting below 100 centimeters for Matfield. This makes the particle size control section 25 to 100 centimeters instead of the upper 50 centimeters of the argillic horizon. In the 25-100 cm zone, the texture is an extremely gravelly silt low with around 20% clay. This would make Matfield loamy-skeletal and not clayey-skeletal.\n2/2014 JGA updated to meet SSRO5 standards; converted from English to metric; added longitude and latitude; changed to semi-tab format, added particle-size control section sand and clay ranges, mean annual soil temperature and soil moisture in characteristics, elevation, precipitation patterns, frost-free days, saturated hydraulic conductivity, Land Resource Region, Taxonomic Version, and soil moisture. Updated competing series and geographically associated soils. Updated range of mean annual precipitation; Removed Thornthwaites Annual PE Index\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Analyses are available for two profiles 63KS017001 (40A1852) and 63KS017003 (40A1853) from Chase County, Kansas.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
