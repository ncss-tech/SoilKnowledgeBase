  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches. The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section is 12 to 18 percent, and silt content is 30 to 55 percent. Combined thickness of the A and E horizons is 20 to 35 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 2, or value of 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Redox concentrations or masses range from none to common. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt/E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Redox concentrations or masses range from none to common in the upper part, and few to many in the lower part. They have colors in shades of brown, red, or yellow. Albic materials (E) on the surface of peds or in streaks and spots in the matrix range from 10 to 35 percent, but are more than 15 percent in some subhorizon at least 2 inches thick. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part, and from very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part. Electrical conductivity ranges from 1.5 to 4.0. Crayfish krotovina range from common to many in some part of the glossic horizon.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, is variable and is a mudstone, sandstone, shale, siltstone or is stratified with these materials. The texture ranges from very fine sandy loam to clay loam. Some pedons have strata of clay or silty clay. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Wanilla series in the same family, and the Alazan, Kurth, Keltys, Multey, and Penning series in closely related families. Alazan, Kurth, Keltys, and Multey soils have a glossic horizon with chroma of 3 or more. In addition, Kurth, Keltys, and Multey soils do not have a water table within 40 inches of the surface. Penning soils have a clay shale discontinuity within a depth of 60 inches.  Wanilla soils do not have a discontinuity of geologic materials within a depth of 80 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Moten soils are on nearly level stream terraces. They are on smooth areas, or on intermound positions on mounded landscapes. Slope gradients are mainly less than 1 percent but range to 2 percent. The soil formed in loamy alluvial sediments and the surface layer in most areas has been modified by wind. The climate is humid temperate with mean annual precipitation ranging from 40 to 50 inches. The average annual temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F. Frost free days range from 235 to 245. The elevation ranges from 150 to 370 feet above sea level. The Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 64 to 82."

Gomery soils are on slightly higher areas, and have a sandy epipedon more than 20 inches thick. Goreen and Rosenwall soils are on higher nearby landscapes, and have a fine textured particle-size control section. Keltys soils are on higher upland positions. Multey soils are on slightly higher associated mound positions on the landscape."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained; slow permeability. Runoff is very low. The soil has a saturated zone with its upper boundary at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet that is perched above the 2C horizon for brief to long durations in the winter and early spring in normal years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mainly in forest with a minor acreage being used for pasture. Timbered areas consist mostly of loblolly and shortleaf pine, water oak, sweetgum, and red oak. Grasses are mainly pinehill bluestem, beaked panicum, low paspalums, longleaf uniola, and sedges. Most areas have a few scattered waxleaf myrtle and/or palmetto."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A previous revision (1993) changed the classification from Aeric Glossaqualfs to Oxyaquic Glossudalfs.  Additional peizometer studies in Trinity County, Texas indicate that the soil does saturate for 60 to 90 consecutive days in normal years in the epipedon and in the upper part of the argillic horizon, and that the chroma 2 material in the upper part of the glossic horizon probably is reduced.  The classification was changed to Aquic Glossudalfs in 2000 and the saturated zone was was changed from 2.5 to 5.0 feet to 1.0 to 2.5 feet.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon -- 0 to 30 inches (A and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon ---- 4 to 30 inches (E horizons).\nGlossic horizon -- 30 to 71 inches (Btg/E horizons).\nLithologic discontinuity -- 71 inches (2C horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
