  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to a densic contact ranges from 20 to 38 inches.  Depth to stratified gravelly and sandy outwash ranges from 22 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section averages 8 to 17 percent clay and 15 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser.  The outwash has more than 85 percent sand.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the loess or silty alluvium and from 0 to 40 percent in the loamy diamicton.  Volume of gravel in the outwash ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average, but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle, and from 0 to 10 percent in the loamy diamicton and underlying gravelly and sandy outwash.  A few stones are on the surface or in the solum in some areas.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. Free carbonates are absent to depths of more than 5 feet. Redoximorphic concentrations are typically throughout the soil below the A horizon.  Redoximorphic depletions are within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Saturation occurs in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Non-cultivated pedons have an A horizon up to 5 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the Ap or A horizon is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silt.\nMaincreek soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the extent to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination, with or without Bt or 2Bt horizons.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizons has color and texture like the E horizon described above.\nThe Bt part of the E/B or B/E horizons, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizons, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.  The 2Bt part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizons, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon with color and texture like the 2Bt part described above.   Some pedons have a 2Btg horizon with dominant chroma of 2.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.  Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc.\nThe 3BC horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon has color like the 3Bt horizon described above.  It is typically stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly."

Brennyville, Magnor, Mora, and Stinnett soils have a densic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Glendenning soils have a densic contact at depths of 60 to 80 inches.  Fallcreek, Hatley, Magroc, Oesterle, Plover, and Rosy soils do not have a densic layer.  In addition, Magroc soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Plover soils have stratified loamy and sandy lacustrine deposits within 40 inches. Rosy soils have carbonates in the series control section."

Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy mantle above the densic contact, slow or very slow in the dense loamy diamicton, and rapid or very rapid in the underlying outwash.  Maincreek soils have a perched seasonal water table above the densic contact at a depth of 0.5 to 1.5 feet at some time from March to June in normal years.  Internal drainage is restricted by the dense loamy diamicton."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for cropland or woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. Timber stands are mostly red maple, balsam fir, and quaking aspen, but sugar maple, white ash, yellow birch, paper birch, and American hornbeam occur in some stands. Some areas have been cleared and are used for cropland or pastureland.  Corn, small grain, and hay are the principal crops."
