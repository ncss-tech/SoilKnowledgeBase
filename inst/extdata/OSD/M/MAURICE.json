  "OVERVIEW": "The Maurice series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, outwash plains, ground moraines and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
