The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches is usually moist in some part from about November 15 until late May, and is continuously dry the rest of the year.\nThe A horizon is pinkish gray or light brown, light brownish gray, pale brown, grayish brown or brown in 7.5YR or 10YR hue.  It is sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  This horizon has weak structure or is massive and ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.  The A3 horizon is one unit higher in value than the A1 horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is brown, dark brown, or yellowish brown in 7.5YR or 10YR hue.  It is sandy clay or heavy clay loam in the upper part and sandy clay loam or clay loam in the lower part and averages 28 to 30 percent clay in the entire horizon.  The upper boundary of the Bt horizon is abrupt and the clay increase from the A horizon to the Bt horizon is 18 to 28 percent.  This horizon has prismatic or angular blocky structure.  It ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline in the upper part and is moderately alkaline in the lower part. Exchangeable sodium is 15 to 35 percent below depth of one meter."
