  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Mispillion soils were formerly mapped as Tidal Marsh miscellaneous areas. These soils are flooded by tidal waters twice daily and by storm surge, except in areas protected by dikes and tide gates. In protected areas, the soils are commonly ponded under several inches of brackish water. These soils become extremely acid when drained or removed from the marsh.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nAquic conditions--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 80 inches is continuously saturated (endosaturation)\nHigh n-value--the zone from the surface to 32 inches has n-value greater than 0.7, typically greater than 1.0 (the material flows easily between the fingers when squeezed)\nSulfidic materials--incubated samples, to a depth of 80 inches, show a drop in pH of 0.5 or more units to a pH value of 4.0 or less within 8 weeks\nHemic soil materials--the zone from 0 to 24 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is one-sixth to two-fifths of the soil volume\nSapric soil materials--the zone from 24 to 40 inches has a fiber content after rubbing that is less than one-sixth of the soil volume\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSERIES DATA MAPUNIT: To be developed\nSERIES INTERPRETATION RECORD(S): DE0015\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nDE0015 MISPILLION  0-  1   52- 57  200-210  38- 48     0-   2\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nDE0015 FREQ           +1-0     APPARENT    -     >60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nDE0015  0-24  MPT PEAT HM              -       -     0- 0    -\nDE0015 24-40  SP HM                    -       -     0- 0    -\nDE0015 40-80  L SICL SIL              0-  0 100-100 15-35    -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
