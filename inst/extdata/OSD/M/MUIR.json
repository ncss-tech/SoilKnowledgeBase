  "OVERVIEW": "The Muir series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on risers and treads of stream terraces in river valleys in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74. Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm (30 inches).",

Type location changed to Clay County, Kansas.\n07/2003 WAW Format changed to semi-tabular, update terminology for reaction and runoff classes.\nFuture updates should consider reclassifying this series to Pachic from Cumulic, most pedons sampled have a regular decrease in organic carbon.\n08/2011 JLG\nAdded metric conversions. Added quadrangle, latitude, and longitude. Added soil moisture regime, soil temperature regime, mean annual soil temperature, and particle size clay and sand content in the RIC.  Added clay and sand content to horizon data in the RIC. Changed depth to free carbonates from 120 centimeters to 100 centimeters. Updated competing series.  Updated geographic setting to tabular format.  Changed parent material to just alluvium from alluvium and colluvium. Lowered the mean annual air temperature to 13 degrees C from 14. Updated geographically associated soils.  Changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity and added flooding frequency. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory data is available for pedon ID numbers: S2009KS157003, S2001KS029004, S2001KS027015, S1953KS157002,S1953KS157004, S2002NE095001, 79NE023132, 88KS061114, and 01KS201038.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
