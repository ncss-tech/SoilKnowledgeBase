  "OVERVIEW": "The Motto series consists of shallow, well drained, slowly permeable, sodium affected soils formed in slope alluvium  over residuum derived from shale and sandstone.  These soils are on hills and structural benches.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
