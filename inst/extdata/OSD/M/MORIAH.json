  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. GRB",
  "REVDATE": "11/1999",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Moriah series consist of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately to slowly permeable soils on broad, low areas on uplands, and on river flood plains of the Lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in sandy to clayey marine deposits that are underlain by fractured porous limestone bedrock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Many pedons have up to 5 percent pebble to boulder-size limestone or chert fragments within the solum.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid in the A and E horizons, and from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  White streaks or pockets of clean sand grains are common.  Masses of iron accumulation shades of yellow or brown.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or red range from few to common.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, within a depth of 40 inches, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, red, and brown range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam to clay.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is composed of soft, weathered, fractured limestone that can be dug with difficulty with a spade, has very firm to extremely firm rupture resistance with low to high excavation difficulty.  It usually contains soft carbonate accumulations along with few to many hard limestone or chert fragments.  It is highly irregular and interspersed with solution holes that range from 4 to 12 inches in diameter and filled with sandy loam to sandy clay textured soil material.  Depth to limestone is very variable within short distances.\nThe 2R horizon is composed of hard, unweathered limestone that has slightly rigid to very rigid rupture resistance with very high to extremely excavation difficulty.  Some areas contain solution holes filled with Btg and/or Cr material."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of about 25 inches (Ap, E1, E2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 25 to 50 inches below the surface (Bt horizon).\nThe depth to the seasonal high water table ranges between 18 to 36 inches for 2 to 5 months in most years.  The porous nature of the limestone bedrock underlying this soil will permit this soil to become saturated by artesian flow in areas adjacent to rivers and streams during periods of high water.  In other areas, the water table is perched above and in the Bt horizon for 1 to 3 months.\nMLRA:  152A.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
