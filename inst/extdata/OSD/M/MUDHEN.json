  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and extends into the upper part of the Bg horizon in some pedons.  Depth to a paralithic contact in shale ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Coarse fragments in the sand and gravel are primarily igneous.  The particle size control section averages between 25 and 33 percent clay.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap, A and/or AB horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Redox concentrations are present as masses of iron accumulation lining ped surfaces and pores.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe middle part of the series control section (BA, Bg, and/or 2Bg horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is clay loam in the upper part (Bg horizon) and gravelly clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy loam in the lower part (2Bg horizon).  Redox concentrations are present throughout, commonly as masses of iron accumulation lining ped surfaces and pores.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part and 15 to 35 percent in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe lower part of the series control section to a depth of 41 inches (2C horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 6.  It commonly is gravelly loamy coarse sand but includes strata of gravel and sand.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Sand content ranges from 75 to 95 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 75 precent, but averages less than 35 percent.  Some pedons contain cobbles and stones.  The lower 10 inches of the series control section to a depth of 51 inches (3Cr horizon) is clay shale.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mudhen soils are on nearly level or depressional parts of strath terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in 40 to 60 inches of loamy outwash and in the underlying calcareous gravel and sand.  Cobbles, stones and a few boulders are evident on eroded risers.  Mean annual temperature varies from 50 to 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation varies from 35 to 40 inches."

Permeability is moderate in the upper and middle parts of the series control section and rapid in the lower part.  Flooding from stream overflow is occasional during the spring.  These soils have an apparent water table at a depth of .5 foot above the surface to 1.5 feet below during the spring in most years."
