  "STATES": "IL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudhen series consists of poorly drained soils that are deep to shale on strath terraces.  These soils formed in loamy outwash and in the underlying calcareous gravel and sand.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid in the substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and extends into the upper part of the Bg horizon in some pedons.  Depth to a paralithic contact in shale ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Coarse fragments in the sand and gravel are primarily igneous.  The particle size control section averages between 25 and 33 percent clay.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap, A and/or AB horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Redox concentrations are present as masses of iron accumulation lining ped surfaces and pores.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe middle part of the series control section (BA, Bg, and/or 2Bg horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is clay loam in the upper part (Bg horizon) and gravelly clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy loam in the lower part (2Bg horizon).  Redox concentrations are present throughout, commonly as masses of iron accumulation lining ped surfaces and pores.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part and 15 to 35 percent in the lower part.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe lower part of the series control section to a depth of 41 inches (2C horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 6.  It commonly is gravelly loamy coarse sand but includes strata of gravel and sand.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Sand content ranges from 75 to 95 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 75 precent, but averages less than 35 percent.  Some pedons contain cobbles and stones.  The lower 10 inches of the series control section to a depth of 51 inches (3Cr horizon) is clay shale.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."
