  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches, thickness of solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .7 to 4 percent, and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  Rock fragments are typically 5 to 10 percent but range from 1 to 15 percent with most being angular sandstone pebbles.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak subangular blocky or granular structure.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard.  It ranges from pH 5.5 to 6.5 and is usually less acid than the rest of the profile.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Usually this horizon has weak platy structure but is subangular blocky in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard.  It ranges from pH 4.5 to 5.8.\nThe A&B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Colors are variable with the finer textured lamellae being somewhat redder in color or brighter in chroma than the remainder of the soil mass.  Usually the horizon has a subangular blocky structure, but structure varies in both grade and class, and between different parts of the horizon depending upon the amount of clay accumulated.  The soil mass is typically sandy loam with lamellae of loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Lamellae range in thickness from 1/2 to 1 1/2 inches and total more than 6 inches in total thickness.  The horizon ranges from pH 4.5 to 5.5 and at least some part of the horizon has base saturation of less than 60 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The McIntyre soils are on mountain side slopes and ridges.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 50 or more percent.  The soils formed in medium to moderately coarse textured parent materials weathered from underlying sandstone bedrock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches with generally uniform distribution throughout the year.  The average annual temperature is 32 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 48 degrees F."

Melvin Williams, Head, Soil Correlation Staff, SCS, West Technical Service Center, dated April 12, 1974.  Subject:  \"Family particle-size classes for soils with argillic horizons that result from lamellae\", it has been placed in the coarse-loamy family.
