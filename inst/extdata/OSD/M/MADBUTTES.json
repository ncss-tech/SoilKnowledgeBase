  "OVERVIEW": "The Madbuttes series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 2540 millimeters (100 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
