They are on convex slope positions at elevations of 992 to 1646 meters (3254 to 5400 feet). These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from schist. The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 2032 to 2794 millimeters (80 to 110 inches). Mean January temperature is about 3 degrees C (37 degrees F); mean July temperature is about 15 degrees C (59 degrees F); and the mean annual temperature is 5 to 8 degrees C (41 to 47 degrees F).
