  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees F.  These soils are dry in the moisture control section for more than half the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature at depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F., and are dry for more than 90 consecutive days within the 3-month period following the summer solstice between depths of 4 and 12 inches, but are moist more than 60 days during the winter.  The solum ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 18 to 26 inches.  The soil is underlain by stratified, medium textured lakelaid sediments.\nThe A horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B2t horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Some pedons have strong or moderate prismatic or strong fine blocky structure.  Exchangeable sodium in the B2t horizon exceeds 15 percent.\nThe B3t horizon is silty clay loam or heavy silt loam.  It has moderate prismatic, subangular or blocky structure."

They formed in mixed lakelaid sediments with a surface influence of loess.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 9 to 11 inches; mean annual temperature is about 50 to 54 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 70 to 74 degrees F., and the mean winter temperature is 31 to 33 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 140 to 160 days."
