  "OVERVIEW": "The Millerridge series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from ultramafic rocks.  Millerridge soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on ultramafic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches, (1321 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F, (13 degrees C).",
