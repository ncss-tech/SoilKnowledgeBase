  "REVDATE": "04/2013",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Middlebrook series consist of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. They are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on bedrock controlled uplands. Bedrock is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 43 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 35 inches, and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 10 to 40 percent by volume in the mineral solum and from 25 to 50 percent in the C horizon. Weighted average of the rock fragment content is less than 35 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout, unless influenced by lime.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 4. Dry color value is 6 or more. Texture is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Where present, the A horizon is up to 4 inches thick. Thin O and E horizons are present in some pedons in undisturbed areas.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6 with faint, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features in the lower part. The B horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak to moderate subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. A BC horizon is present in some pedons and replaces the C horizon.\nThe CB horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is sandy loam to loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or very weak subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is sandy loam to loam in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or has plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable or firm. Some pedons have a Cd horizon below a depth of 2 feet that is very firm. Other pedons have a 2Cr horizon just above the bedrock.\nThe 2R horizon is dominantly massive sandstone, but layers of shale or siltstone are often interbedded."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ashfield, Beechwood, Gilmanton (T), and Metacomet series. Ashland soils are greater than 60 inches to bedrock and have rock fragments dominated by dark schist. Beechwood soils have a coarser textured substratum and deeper sola. Gilmanton and Metacomet soils have bedrock deeper than 60 inches and fragments mainly from granite and gneiss.\nThe Chautaugua, Ischua, Ludlow, Mongaup, Montesa, Pittstown, Pompton, Rainbow, Sutton, Wapping, Watchaug, Wilbraham, and Woodbridge series are in related families. The Chautaugua, Ludlow, Montesa, Pittstown, Pompton, Rainbow, Sutton, Wapping, Watchaug, Wilbraham, and Woodbridge soils have a mesic temperature regime. The Ischua soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section. Mongaup soils are better drained and lack redoximorphic features within a depth of 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Middlebrook soils are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on bedrock controlled uplands, dominantly occurring on broad hilltops and in saddle positions. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. The till forms a mantle 20 to 40 inches thick over the sandstone, siltstone, and shale bedrock from which it is derived. Mean annual temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 46 inches; and the mean frost-free season ranges from 100 to 130 days. The elevation ranges from 1750 to 2500 feet above sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Gretor and well drained Mongaup soils are nearby drainage associates. The Halcott and Torull soils are both less than 20 inches deep to bedrock, with Halcott a well drained soil and Torull a poorly drained soil. The well drained Lewbath soils and the moderately well drained Willdin soils are in adjacent areas where the soil mantle is deeper."
