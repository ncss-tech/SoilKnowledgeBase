  "OVERVIEW": "The Moreglade series consists of deep to very deep, well-drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from welded tuff, rhyolite and basalt. They are on canyonsides and foothills and have slopes of 12 to 65 percent. The average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C, and the average annual precipitation is about 340 millimeters.",
