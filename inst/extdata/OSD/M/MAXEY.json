  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. The soils are usually moist and are moist continually between depths of 12 and 35 inches for 50 to 70 days in spring and summer, but are dry for 45 to 65 consecutive days in late summer and autumn. Unless artificially drained, they are saturated in a subhorizon between depths of 30 and 40 inches for a period in summer and have dominant chroma of 2 or less accompanied by mottles due to segregation of iron or manganese below a depth of 20 inches but within 40 inches of the surface. Depth to zones of lime accumulation range from 20 to 40 inches. The 10- to 40-inch control section averages loamy fine sand or loamy sand and has less than 15 percent rock fragments.  The upper part of the profile is dominantly loamy fine sand or loamy sand, but one or more layer of moderately coarse or medium texture is at depths of 25 to 40 inches. The organic matter decreases regularly with increasing depth. The Ap horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. However, it is not both darker than value of 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist, both broken and crushed. This horizon is usually noncalcareous but is calcareous in some disturbed areas due to land leveling. The C horizon above a depth of 20 inches has dominant chroma of 3 or brighter and is noncalcareous. Few or common, faint or distinct mottles due to segregations of iron or manganese are in one or more layers above a depth of 40 inches.\nCOMPETING SERIES AND ThEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  These are the Arloval, Falk, Fallon, Feltham, Letha, Schodson, and Wodskow series. Arloval soils have no layer in the 10- to 40-inch control section that is finer textured than loamy fine sand. Falk, Fallon, Letha, Schodson, and Wodskow soils have moderately coarse textured control sections. Falk soils are noncalcareous. Feltham soils lack mottles due to segregations of iron and manganese and saturation with water within a depth of 40 inches. Letha soils are calcareous and high in exchangeable sodium in the C1 horizons. Schodson soils are mostly noncalcareous in the control section. Wodskow soils have cambic and calcic horizons."

The soils formed in stratified alluvium and eolian material from mixed rock sources (sands are dominantly quartz). The climate is semiarid with dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches including 1 to 3 feet of snow.  Average freeze-free period is 125 to 140 days."
