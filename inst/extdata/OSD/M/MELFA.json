Classification as Mollic Fluvaquent is tentative.  Diagnostic features will be used as series criteria.\nSIR = VA0341\nMLRA = 133A, 153A, 153B\nREVISED = 5/14/90\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University soil survey laboratory data show more than 7 dS/m electrical conductivity per meter and 80 centimoles or more of soluble Ca, Mg, K, and Na per liter of saturation extract in more than half the upper 1 m of soil for the typical pedon and 3 other profiles.\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nVA0341 MELFA       0-  2   57- 60  180-250  38- 46     0-   5\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nVA0341 FREQ            0-1.0  APPARENT JAN-DEC  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nVA0341  0- 6  MUCK MPT                0-  0    -     0- 0  10- 30\nVA0341  6-13  SL FSL L                0-  0  95-100  5-18  10- 30\nVA0341 13-50  SL FSL L                0-  0  75-100  5-18  15- 45\nVA0341 50-65  COS SL L                0-  0  75-100  2-18  20- 55\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
