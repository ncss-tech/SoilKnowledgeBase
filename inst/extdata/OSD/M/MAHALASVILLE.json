  "OVERVIEW": "The Mahalasville series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy and sandy outwash. The Mahalasville soils are on outwash plains, lake plains, till plains, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

In drained areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface during the winter and spring in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately high or high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum, and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum."
