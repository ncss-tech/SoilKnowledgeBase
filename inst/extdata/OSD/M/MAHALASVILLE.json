Cald and Gabriel soils have a mollic epipedon that is thicker than 53 cm (21 inches). Cyclone and Treaty soils are not stratified in the lower part of the series control section with sandy or loamy textures. Luray soils do not have textures with more than 20 percent sand except as thin strata in the lower part of the series control section. Mahalaland soils average more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Ragsdale soils have less than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."

The soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy and sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1118 mm (32 to 44 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (49 to 53 degrees F)."

Mahalasville soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Camden, Martinsville, and Proctor soils that are on the higher landform positions; and the somewhat poorly drained Brenton, Starks, and Whitaker soils that are on slightly higher positions. Mahalasville soils also occur in depressions near the till derived, moderately well drained Celina and Miami soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Crosby and Fincastle soils, which are on higher landform positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained and very poorly drained. In drained areas, the depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface during the winter and spring in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately high or high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum, and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum."
