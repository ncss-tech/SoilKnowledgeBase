  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mortimer soils are on moraines and till plains of late Wisconsin age. Slope ranges from 2 to 6 percent. They formed in fine-textured, calcareous till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 213 to 274 meters (700 to 900 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Nappanee soils are on slight rises and low knolls. The well drained St. Clair soils are on higher or more sloping landscape positions."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is high or very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low in the solum and low in the dense till. Permeability is slow in the solum and slow or very slow in the dense till."
