  "OVERVIEW": "The McGuire series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial outwash material influenced by loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. McGuire soils are on outwash terraces and terrace slopes.\nSlopes are 0 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

These soils formed in glaciofluvial outwash materials mixed with some loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Elevations are 2,100 to 2,400 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is about 24 to 26 inches. The average January temperature is 28 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 66 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 46 degrees to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."

There is more than 50 percent (estimated) fine sand and coarser in the loamy material and is therefore is not contrasting.\nVitrandic feature - the zone from 1 to 15 inches\nThe discontinuity in the 2Bt2 horizon represents the limit of the vitrandic feature and the influence of air-fall volcanic ash.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
