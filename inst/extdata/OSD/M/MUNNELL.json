    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of solum to contrasting texture ranges from 28 to 39 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 degrees to 52 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees F from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil between depths of 8 to 18 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 until November 10 (145 days).  The moisture control section is dry more than half the time the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  Mollic epipedon is 10 to 13 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2; 10YR 5/2 or 5/3 and moist color of 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Pebbles range from 15 to 25 percent.  Clay content ranges from 10 to 15 percent.\nThe BAt and Bt horizons have dry color of 10YR 5/2, 6/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/3; 5YR 5/2, 5/3 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/2; 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline. The Bt horizon is gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam or sandy clay loam and averages 18 to 30 percent clay.  The BAt horizon has at least 3 percent more clay content than the A horizon.  Pebbles range from 10 to 29 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has dry colors of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/3; 5YR 4/3, 5/3 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3, 4/3; 5YR 3/3, 3/4 or 4/3.  The C horizon is very gravelly sand or very gravelly loamy sand.  Clay content is 0 to 5 percent.  Pebbles 2 mm to 10 mm in size range from 40 to 60 percent."
