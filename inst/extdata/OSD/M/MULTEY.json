    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Hicota series in the same family, and the Alazan, Besner, Elysian, Keltys and Kurth series in closely related families. Besner and Hicota soils have electrical conductivity less than 1 mmho/cm in the lower part of the solum. In addition, Besner soils are in a semiactive activity class, and Hicota soils formed on Red River terraces. Keltys soils have a solum 40 to 60 inches thick and have a saturated zone within a depth of 40 inches for more than 30 cumulative days in normal years. Alazan and Kurth soils have a fine-loamy control section. In addition Alazan soils have aquic conditions in the upper part of the argillic horizon, and Kurth soils have a saturated zone within a depth of 40 inches for more than 30 cumulative days in normal years. Elysian soils have a glossic horizon that is less than 20 inches thick and they do not have an albic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Multey soils are on mounds and low narrow discontinuous ridge positions on Pleistocene age stream terraces. These soils have been formed or modified by wind. The mounds and low ridges are about 1 to 4 feet higher than the intermound areas. The mounds are about 30 to 80 feet in diameter and the ridges are about 20 to 60 feet wide and 75 to 150 feet long. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 68 degrees F. Frost free days range from 235 to 245 and the elevation ranges from 150 to 370 above sea level. The Thornthwaite PE index ranges from 64 to 82."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were formerly included in Besner or Keltys soils. A previous revision (12/93) changed the classification from Aquic Glossudalfs to Typic Glossudalfs and changed the water table depth from 2.5 to 3.5 feet to more than 6 feet deep.  Observations and comparison with monitored soils in Trinity County, Texas indicate that these soils have a saturated zone within a depth of 6 feet in normal years.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon --  0 to 25 inches (A and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon ---- 18 to 25 inches (E2 horizon).\nGlossic horizon -- 25 to 65 inches (E/Bt and Bt/E horizons).\nArgillic horizon - 38 to 70 inches (Bt/E, and BCt horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
