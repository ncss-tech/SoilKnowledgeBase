  "STATES": "AZ,CO,NM,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mido series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived mainly from sandstone. Mido soils are on mesas, benches, plateaus, stabilized dunes, hills, sand sheets, dunes on structural benches, and in broad valleys. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
