    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Magna soils occur on smooth to undulating flood plains, lake plains, and low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 4,200 to 5,800 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium and reworked lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 65 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 150 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 2 feet (very shallow to moderately deep free water occurrence classes) between April and August.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  Drained phases are recognized.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for long periods between April and June."
