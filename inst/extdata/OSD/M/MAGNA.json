  "OVERVIEW": "The Magna series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Magna soils are on flood plains and low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
