Elevation ranges from 6,600 to 7,300 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."

(A, BA, and Bw horizons)\nSlickensides - 14 to 88 inches. (Bss1 and Bss2 horizons)\nClassified according to Keys of Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNote: The type location was moved and re-classified from the old classification of Very-fine, smectitic, mesic Aridic Gypsiusterts. A new pedon description was created on September 30th, 2004. The old type location became the new type location for the proposed Stanley series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalent was determined using a field calcimeter.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
