  "OVERVIEW": "The Moriartche series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium deposits derived from shale. Moriartche soils are on alluvial flats on valley floors. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

A new pedon description was created on September 30th, 2004. The old type location became the new type location for the proposed Stanley series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Calcium carbonate equivalent was determined using a field calcimeter.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
