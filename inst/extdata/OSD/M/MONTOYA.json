  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Dalby (TX), Globe (T NM), and Reefridge (CA) series. Similar soils are the Armijo and Moriarty series. Dalby soils have mean annual soil temperature ranging from 63 to 68 degrees F. Globe soils are poorly drained, and have soil temperature ranging from 63 to 67 degrees F. Reefridge soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches of the surface. Armijo soils have lithologic discontinuities below 40 inches of the surface. Moriarty soils have mesic temperature regimes."

They formed in alluvium from shale of the \"redbed\" formations. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. The climate is semiarid continental. Mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 60 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 16 inches. The precipitation pattern is characterized by a marked summer maximum with frequent heavy thunderstorms of short duration. The frost-free period ranges from 180 to 200 days and elevation ranges from 3,900 to 5,300 feet."
