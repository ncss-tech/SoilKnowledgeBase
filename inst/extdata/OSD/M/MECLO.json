  "OVERVIEW": "The Meclo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from silty lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 4 to 50 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
