  "OVERVIEW": "The Mangum series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium. These soils are on nearly level flood plains of major streams of the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA-78) and North Central Prairies (MLRA-80B). Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are calcareous throughout. The texture in the 10- to 40-inch control section is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay with clay content ranging from 35 to 60 percent. Partially decomposed leaves are along some vertical cracks, and thin strata and lenses of silty clay loam and silt loam are in some pedons. Some pedons contain buried dark A horizons at depths of 20 to 40 inches that have blocky and subangular blocky structure.\nThe A horizon is reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 2.5YR 5/4, 4/4), light reddish brown (5YR 6/4), red (2.5YR 4/6, 5/6), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6), or brown (7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4). It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or silt loam. If the A horizon is 10 or more inches thick, moist color value or chroma are 3.5 or more.\nThe B and C horizons are light reddish brown (2.5YR 6/4; 5YR 6/4), reddish brown (2.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4), light red (2.5YR 6/6), red (2.5YR 4/6, 5/6), reddish yellow (5YR 6/6), or yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6). The C horizon contains few to common films, threads, and concretions of calcium carbonate.  Electrical conductivity increases with depth ranging from less than 2 mmhos in the surface to 8 mmhos at depths greater than 60 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Throck series. Closely related series include the Chargo, Denhawken, Ellis, Miller, Montoya, Navajo, Padgett, Stamford, and Treadway series. Throck soils have shale at depths of less than 60 inches. Chargo and Denhawken soils have average annual soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F. Ellis soils are moist for longer periods and lack stratification. Miller soils have mollic epipedons. Montoya soils are usually dry. Navajo soils have average annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F. Stamford soils have intersecting slickensides, and parallelepipeds which are tilted 10 degrees to 60 degrees from the horizontal. Treadway soils have a conductivity greater than 2 mmhos at depths less than 40 inches.  Padgett soils have intersecting slickensides."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mangum soils are on nearly level flood plains than overflow about once or twice a year to once every 20 years. The soils formed in clayey sediments several feet thick washed largely from clayey soils formed in Permian or Triassic red beds. Average annual precipitation from 19 to 32 inches, and mean annual temperature from 57 degrees to 68 degrees F. Frost free period is 185 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 1000 to 2500 feet. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 28 to 44."

Beckman soils lack cambic horizons and have fluventic properties. The Clairmont, Colorado, Gageby, Spur, and Weswood soils have formed in less clayey alluvial sediments than Mangum soils and have less than 35 percent clay in the control section. Treadway soils have conductivity greater than 2 mmhos at depths less than 40 inches and occur on higher landscape positions."
