  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Maghills series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone. Maghills soils are on alluvial fans and fan skirts. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
