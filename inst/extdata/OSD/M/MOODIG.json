  "OVERVIEW": "The Moodig series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glacial till on moraines and drumlins.  The till is mostly sandy loam.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum..  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section averages between 5 and 17 percent clay and from 45 to 75 percent fine sand or coarser.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section . Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 35 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper part of the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum.  Redox concentrations are in the albic or spodic horizons within a depth of 20 inches.  Saturation occurs within 20 inches at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with similar hues, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Typically texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or the gravelly analogs but in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It has texture like the Bhs horizon above.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nMoodig soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E' part of these horizons has color and texture like the E' horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has colors like the Bt part described above. Typically, texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the gravelly analogs but thin subhorizons of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand are in some pedons.  Some pedons with a B/E horizon do not have a Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  Typically, texture is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.  In some pedons, loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand occurs below 40 inches."
