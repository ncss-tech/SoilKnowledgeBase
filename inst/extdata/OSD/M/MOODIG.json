  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section averages between 5 and 17 percent clay and from 45 to 75 percent fine sand or coarser.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section . Volume of gravel ranges from 2 to 35 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper part of the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum.  Redox concentrations are in the albic or spodic horizons within a depth of 20 inches.  Saturation occurs within 20 inches at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with similar hues, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Typically texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or the gravelly analogs but in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It has texture like the Bhs horizon above.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nMoodig soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E' part of these horizons has color and texture like the E' horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has colors like the Bt part described above. Typically, texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the gravelly analogs but thin subhorizons of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand are in some pedons.  Some pedons with a B/E horizon do not have a Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  Typically, texture is sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam.  In some pedons, loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand occurs below 40 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Belding, Mudlake, Parkfalls, Pesabic, and Worwood series.  A similar soil is the Monico series.  Belding, Parkfalls, and Pesabic soils have a densic contact in the lower part of the series control section. Mudlake soils have more than 50 percent silt in the upper 12 to 40 inches of the series control section.  Worwood soils have more than 85 percent sand (stratified sandy outwash) within a depth of 40 inches and have stratified loamy and sandy textures within 60 inches.  Monico soils do not have an argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moodig soils are in depressions and drainageways on moraines and drumlins.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  These soils formed in till which is mostly sandy loam.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1950 feet."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to low.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum.  A perched seasonal high water table is at a depth of 0.5 to 2 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period September to June in 6 or more out of 10 years years."
