The depth to carbonates and the clayey lacustrine deposits or till ranges from 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches). The mollic epipedon is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick and includes the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons.

The volume of rock fragments is less than 10 percent in the series control section.\nThe Ap, A, or AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt or 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically is clay loam, loam, silty clay loam with a high content of sand, sandy clay loam or less commonly sandy loam or fine sandy loam. If a mantle of loess is present, it is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt or 3Bt horizon, which formed in lacustrine sediments or till, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silty clay or clay. Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent.

Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 11 degrees C (48 to 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1020 mm (31 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 158 to 285 meters (512 to 935 feet) above mean sea level."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (1.41 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the loess and outwash and moderately low or moderately high (0.14 to 1.41 micrometers/s) in the lacustrine sediments or till.
