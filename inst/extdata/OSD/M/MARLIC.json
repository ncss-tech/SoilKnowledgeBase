These soils are dry in the moisture control section more than half of the time when the soil temperature at the lithic contact is above 40 degrees F. The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 5 to 20 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 3 percent. Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 12 to 20 inches. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nThe BA horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nThe Bt and 2Bt horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry or moist, and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. The 2Bt is clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 35 to 40 percent clay. They have moderate fine or medium prismatic or subangular blocky structure."

Adinot soils are moderately well drained and are dry in all parts from early June to early November and are moist in all parts from mid-December to early May. Borland, Jilson, Laric, Malinda, McQuarrie, Pass Canyon and Terca soils lack a discontinuity with more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Cooperopolis soils have a surface A horizon with 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and 0.2 to 0.5 percent acid oxalate extractable Al plus  Fe, and also have a 2Bk horizon at a depth of 10 inches or more.  Libertybutte soils are dominated by rock fragments of metasedimentary origin and lack a 2Bt horizon.  Yertneg soils have a xeric soil moisture regime."

These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. the theaverage July temperature is 69 degrees F.
