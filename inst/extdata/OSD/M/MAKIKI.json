  "OVERVIEW": "The Makiki series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from alluvium mixed with ash and cinders.  Makiki soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 45 inches and mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.",
