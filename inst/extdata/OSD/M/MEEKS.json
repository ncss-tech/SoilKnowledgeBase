    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 17 inches thick.   Depth to the Bqm horizon is greater than 100 cm.  Gravel, cobbles, stones and boulders average from 40 to 80 percent by volume of the 25 to 100 cm control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is 4 degrees to 7 degrees C. and the mean summer soil temperature is 11 degrees to 13 degrees C.  The soils are usually moist between depths of 36 and 155 cm and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section from late June until early October.\n0 horizons are 3 to 8 cm thick.\nThe A horizon has colors of 10YR 4/1, 5/1, 4/2, 5/2, 4/3, 5/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragments are mainly gravel and average 5 to 30 percent by volume with some cobbles and stones.  It is single grain, massive or has weak granular structure.  It is slightly to moderately acid.  Organic matter ranges from 2 to 8 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has colors of 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 5/3, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2.  It is loamy coarse sand or sand modified by 40 to 80 percent gravel, cobbles, stones, or boulders by volume.  It is slightly or moderately acid.\nThe Bqm horizon is weakly to strongly cemented glacial till and is hard or very hard when dry and firm or very firm when moist.  A discontinuous to continuous lamina about 1 to 2 millimeters thick coats the surface of this horizon.  It is moderately or strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Meeks soils are on gently sloping to very steep lateral, terminal, and ground moraines at elevations between 1890 to 2670 meters.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 70 percent but are mainly less than 30 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from stony to bouldery sandy glacial debris and alluvium derived from mixed but predominately granitic sources.  The mean annual precipitation is 580 to 1780 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 4 to 8 degrees C., mean January temperature is -3 degrees C., mean July temperature is 16 degrees C.  The average frost-free season is < 100 days."

Gefo soils are sandy and on outwash plains. Celio soils are oxyaquic and on outwash plains and flood plains.  Tallac soils are Loamy-skeletal and on the same landforms."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Meeks soils were formerly classified as members of the sandy-skelatal, mixed family of Entic Cryumbrepts.  The cryic soil temperature regime was based upon a rule of thumb that 0 horizons are not considered unless the thickness is greater than 3 inches.  This concept is not considered to be valid in California and conflicts with Soil Taxonomy. The classification was updated in February 2001 using the Eighth Edition to Soil Taxonomy. This series was formerly classified as sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Entic Xereumbrepts. Competing series were not checked at that time.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the mineral surface to 33 cm (A1 and A2 horizons}\nBw horizon - based on increase in chroma, horizon is too sandy for a cambic horizon, the zone from 33 to 160 cm (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nBqm horizon - compacted glacial till with weak silica cementation, the zone from 160 to 185 cm (Bqm horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
