  "OVERVIEW": "The Moslander series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, valley fill, and marshes.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent and slightly concave.  The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
