  "OVERVIEW": "The Moslander series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  These soils are on stream terraces, valley fill, and marshes.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent and slightly concave.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 19 inches thick.  These soils are typically calcareous throughout when dried but are free of carbonates as deep as  10 inches in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section when averaged is loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 55 percent sand with less than 35 percent but more than 15 percent being fine sand or coarser.  Thin strata of varying textures are common in some pedons but when averaged meet the criteria stated above.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent rounded gravel above a depth of 40 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of N through 2.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of N through 2.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos.  High chroma redox concentrations are common in this horizon.  It is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of N through 2.  EC ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos.  Salt accumulations  are present in some pedons.  High chroma redox concentrations are common.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevations are 6,600 to 8,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 19 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 50 to 80 days, but light frost may occur during any month. This soil has a water table within 20 inches of the surface during most of the year."
