  "OVERVIEW": "The Mirkwood series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Mirkwood soils are on mountains. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
