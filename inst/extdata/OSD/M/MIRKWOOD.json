Etinarg and Hoot soils have more than 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Theon soils have abrupt boundaries between the ochric epipedon and the argillic horizon. Tognoni soils have argillic horizons with 35 to 45 percent clay. Valleycity soils have particle-size control sections which are dominated by stones, are more than 36 cm to bedrock, and have BCk horizons. Vium soils have 8 to 16 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Waucoba soils are 36 to 50 cm deep to bedrock."

Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,700 meters. The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
