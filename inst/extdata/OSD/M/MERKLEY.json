Lago soils have fine-silty particle-size control sections and are somewhat poorly drained. Ream soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections and very gravelly to extremely gravelly substratums. Iphil soils are on loess covered uplands and terraces above Merkley soils. Lago soils are on silty alluvium covered flood plains lower on the landscape than Merkley soils. Ream soils are on similar landscapes as Merkley, but are on concave slopes when associated with Merkley soils."
