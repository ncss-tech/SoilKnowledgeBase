  "OVERVIEW": "The Merkley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and mixed alluvium. They are on stream terraces. Permeability is moderate. Merkley soils have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
