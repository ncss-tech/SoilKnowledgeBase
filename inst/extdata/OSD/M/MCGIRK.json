Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Btg and 2Btg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has masses of iron accumulation or depletions with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McGirk soils are on concave footslopes, toeslopes, and sideslopes of hills that are at the heads of drainageways.  They are on positions above floodplains or terraces and below upland soils formed in residuum or loess.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium washed from the adjacent uplands. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 42 inches."

The Menfro and Winfield soils are fine-silty and are on adjacent higher positions.  Moniteau soils are fine-silty and are on adjacent lower floodplains.  Union soils have fragipans and are on higher nearby uplands.  Westerville soils are fine-silty and are on adjacent floodplains."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were previously classified as Epiaqualfs, but further study shows that Endoaqualfs is the correct classification (1998 Keys to Taxonomy).\nCurrent mapping has a slope range of mostly less than 5 percent.  Mapping units with higher slope ranges in older surveys will be recorrelated during update activities.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (Ap and BEg horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 11 inches to 46 inches (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons);\naquic condition- redox features starting at 6 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
