  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to siltstone bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  In some pedons, the upper 10 inches is a thin mantle of loess.  Average clay content of the particle size control section ranges from 12 to 30 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam, and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 3 to 10 percent.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Structure ranges from weak to moderate medium or coarse prismatic to weak fine or medium subangular blocky. It is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 8 to 14 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam or silty clay loam, and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 8 to 12 percent.\nThe Cr horizon is soft siltstone and is easily penetrated by a spade or auger, but becomes hard when exposed to air.  It has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value 6 through 8 and 5 through 7 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 14 percent.  Mottles range from few to common.  Dark concretions of Fe and Mn oxides range from few to common. Soft carbonate accumulations range from few to common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mariaville soils are on gently sloping to very steep convex ridges bordering deeply entrenched streams and large drainageways.  Slope gradients range from 3 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in sediments weathered from Ogallala and pre-Ogallala siltstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Anselmo, Boyd, Dunday, Lakoma, Meadin, O'Neill, Paka, and Sansarc soils.  Anselmo and Dunday soils contain more sand and are deeper and formed in sandy and loamy materials.  They generally occur above Mariaville soils.  Boyd, Lakoma, and Sansarc soils contain more clay and are formed in weathered shale on lower parts of side slopes.  Meadin and O'Neill soils have sand and gravel underlying materials and occur above Mariaville soils.  Paka soils have weathered siltstone at depths of 40 to 60 inches and occur in similar positions to Mariaville soils, but generally have lesser slopes."
