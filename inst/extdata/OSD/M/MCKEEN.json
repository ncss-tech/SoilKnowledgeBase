  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges form 0 to 6 inches.  The 10-to 40-inch control section typically is stratified with loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam textures averaging between 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  Thin strata of coarser or finer textures are common.  Some pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or very fine sandy loam and less commonly fine sandy loam or silty clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C and Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, chroma of 1 or 2.  They typically have redox depletions and concentrations.  Textures are loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Coarser or finer textures occur as thin strata or are below a depth of 40 inches.  The C and Cg horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They are artificially saturated due to dams on the Missouri River.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 18 inches."

In addition, Banks soils are sandy and Lallie and Lohler soils are fine.   Banks soils are on levees adjacent to the river.  Havrelon and Lohler soils are on higher lying positions on the floodplain.  Lallie soils are in oxbows."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  Runoff is   slow or ponded.  Permeability is moderate.  A seasonal high water table is at the surface to a depth of 1 foot at some time during the period of January through December.  Ponded phases have a seasonal high water table that ranges from 3 feet above the surface to a depth of 1 foot at some time during the period of January through December.  The water table depth and duration is affected by fluctuations in the levels of Lake's Oahe and Sakakawea."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of two inches (A horizon); aquic suborder criteria - chroma of 2 and redox concentrations in 40 to 50 cm layer (Cg1 horizon); irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth - indicated by stratifications within C horizon layers and color and texture differences between C horizons.\nThe wetness of this series is a result of waters of Lake's Oahe and Sakakawea being backed up due to dams on the Missouri River.  These soils would have been the Havrelon series prior to the dams on the river.  These soils were most probably mapped as Havrelon or variants of Havrelon and Neche in Emmons and Burleigh Counties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
