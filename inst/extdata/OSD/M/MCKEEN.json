  "OVERVIEW": "The Mckeen series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in stratified, loamy alluvium.  These soils are on low flats on the floodplain of the Missouri River.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

The 10-to 40-inch control section typically is stratified with loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam textures averaging between 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  Thin strata of coarser or finer textures are common.  Some pedons have an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or very fine sandy loam and less commonly fine sandy loam or silty clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C and Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, chroma of 1 or 2.  They typically have redox depletions and concentrations.  Textures are loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Coarser or finer textures occur as thin strata or are below a depth of 40 inches.  The C and Cg horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

A seasonal high water table is at the surface to a depth of 1 foot at some time during the period of January through December.  Ponded phases have a seasonal high water table that ranges from 3 feet above the surface to a depth of 1 foot at some time during the period of January through December.  The water table depth and duration is affected by fluctuations in the levels of Lake's Oahe and Sakakawea."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of two inches (A horizon); aquic suborder criteria - chroma of 2 and redox concentrations in 40 to 50 cm layer (Cg1 horizon); irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth - indicated by stratifications within C horizon layers and color and texture differences between C horizons.\nThe wetness of this series is a result of waters of Lake's Oahe and Sakakawea being backed up due to dams on the Missouri River.  These soils would have been the Havrelon series prior to the dams on the river.  These soils were most probably mapped as Havrelon or variants of Havrelon and Neche in Emmons and Burleigh Counties."
