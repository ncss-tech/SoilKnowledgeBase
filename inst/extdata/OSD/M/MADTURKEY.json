    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Madturkey soils are on linear to concave or slightly convex positions of backslopes and footslopes on mountains. Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. Elevations are 60 to 400 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from weakly cemented siltstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1250 to 1780 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days."
