  "OVERVIEW": "The Minkler series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine material with a mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on river terraces that are rarely flooded.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 48 to 53 degrees F.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 14 to 27 inches.  The lower part of the control section averages 1 to 10 percent clay and has no coarse fragments.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hues of 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 0, 1 or 2 moist or dry.  it is stratified loamy fine sand, fine sand,and very fine sandy loam."
