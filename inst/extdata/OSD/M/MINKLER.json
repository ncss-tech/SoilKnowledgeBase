The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 48 to 53 degrees F.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 14 to 27 inches.  The lower part of the control section averages 1 to 10 percent clay and has no coarse fragments.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hues of 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 4 through 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 0, 1 or 2 moist or dry.  it is stratified loamy fine sand, fine sand,and very fine sandy loam."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Minkler soils are on terraces slightly above the normal flood plain at elevations of 50 to 80 feet.  They formed in stratified medium and coarse textured alluvium and lacustrine material with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 190 days."
