  "OVERVIEW": "The Mcwatt series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt.  Mcwatt soils are on plateaus and lake terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
