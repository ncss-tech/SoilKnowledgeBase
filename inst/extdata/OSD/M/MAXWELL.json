  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates is 24 to 56 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 64 degrees F and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F at anytime.  Crack open and close once each year.  They remain open during the period from July to October and are closed the rest of the year.  Common to many intersecting slickensides occur in all or part of the lower A horizon.  The soils have Ca/Mg ratio of less than 2:1.  The A horizon is neutral, 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR hue with value of 2, 3, 4, or 5 dry and 3 moist.  Chroma is less than 1.5 dry or moist.  The A horizon is heavy clay loam or clay and usually has prismatic or blocky structure.  In some pedons the surface few inches have strong granular structure.  This horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and is noneffervescent.\nThe C horizon is neutral, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue and has value of 4, 5, 6, or 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  Chroma is less than 1.5 dry or moist to depths of more than 40 inches. In some pedons the C horizon below a depth of 40 inches has chroma of 2. It is silty clay or clay and is very weak to strongly effervescent.  Carbonates commonly occur as medium-size soft masses."

Also, Clear Lake soils are poorly or very poorly drained; Hildreth soils are over unrelated material (see Remarks); and Willows soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium and commonly have gypsum or salt crystals, or both, in the C horizon.  Subaco soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact."

These soils formed in alluvium derived mostly from serpentinitic rocks.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 50 inches.  Average January temperature is 45 degrees F; average July temperature is 75 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 58 degrees to 62 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 150 to 275 days."

A part of the Hildreth soils should be classified as Entic Pelloxererts because moist value in the upper 12 inches is higher than 3.5.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
