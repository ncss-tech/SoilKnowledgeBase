Crunstown soils have redox features in the lower part of the series control section. Eleva soils have a paralithic contact at depths between 51 to 102 cm (20 and 40 inches). Hillsdale soils have hues yellower than 5YR throughout. Oshtemo soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section and have more than 90 percent sand there."

These soils formed in thick deposits of sandy loam or loamy sand glacial till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.6 degrees C (45 to 51 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Coloma and the competing Lapeer and Wyocena soils.  All of these soils occupy similar landscape positions, but are distinguished from the Mecan soils principally on the basis of solum development.  Coloma soils are coarser-textured, have less well developed argillic horizons in the form of lamellae, and are acid in the lower part of the solum."
