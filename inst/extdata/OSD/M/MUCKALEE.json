  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The A horizon is strongly acid through neutral and the C horizon is medium acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Value of 3 is allowed when A horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Few or common thin strata of contrasting textures are allowed and range from 0.1 to 1.0 inch in thickness.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 or it is neutral with value of 5, 6, or 7.  Some pedons have lower C horizons that are greenish gray (5GY 6/1, 5/1; 5G 6/1, 5/1).  Few to many strata or mottles have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 8.  The C horizon is loamy sand or sandy loam.  There are strata of sand, sandy clay loam, or clay loam 0.1 to 3.0 inches thick. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages about 10 to 18 percent clay."

Angelina, Herod, Kinston, and Wehadkee soils have more than 18 percent clay between 10 to 40 inches.  In addition, Angelina and Kinston soils are in acid families.  Wehadkee soils have mixed mineralogy.  Bibb soils are in an acid family.  Briscot and Enoree soils have mixed mineralogy.  Osier soils are sandy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Muckalee soils occur on the flood plains of streams in the Coastal Plains.  The soil formed in loamy and sandy alluvium.  Stream channels are generally shallow and meandering. The soils flood frequently for brief periods.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 65 to 70 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 45 to 55 inches."

Grady soils are clayey and in depressions or around the head of or along narrow drainageways.  Meggett soils are in a fine family.  Osier soils are sandy throughout.  Riverview soils are well drained."
