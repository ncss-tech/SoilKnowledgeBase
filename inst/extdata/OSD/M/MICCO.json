Reaction of the organic material ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid, however, it is 4.4 or less in 0.0lM calcium chloride in at least some part of the organic material.  Reaction of the underlying material ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Oe horizon has hue of 5YR to l0YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Fiber content is dominantly 50 to 90 percent unrubbed and less than 40 percent rubbed.  Texture is mucky peat.  However, cropped areas have a sapric (muck and Oa) plow layer and some pedons have a sapric (muck and Oa) horizon immediately above the Cg horizon.\nThe 2Cg horizon, where present, has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of l or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand or loamy sand.\nThe 3Cg horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of l or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Texture is sand loam or sandy clay loam; or stratified loamy and sandy material that crushes to sandy loam."
