Baraboo, Dubuque, La Farge and Palsgrove soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches.  Bertrand and Hackers soils have strata immediately below the argillic horizon containing more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  Blackhammer soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Camden, Dodge, Flagg, Greenridge, Middletown, Piscasaw, Rush, Russell, St. Charles and Thebes soils average more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the lower part of the series control section.  Fayette and Rozetta soils typically have yellower hue and an average soil temperature cooler than 54 degrees F.  Jemerson soils have more than 5 percent sand in the upper part of the control section.  Jackson, Lambeau, Pepin, Seaton and Stookey soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Martinsburg soils have a thicker E horizon and the horizon having the maximum clay content is deeper in the profile.  Ridgway and Yellowriver soils have more than 5 percent sand in some horizon above a depth of 40 inches.  Ruma soils have more than 7 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Sylvan soils have sola less than 40 inches and have carbonates within 40 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Base saturation at 1.25m below the top of the argillic horizon ranges from 60 to 87 percent and averages about 72 percent. The clay mineralogy is mixed but dominated by montmorillonite (est. 60-75 percent) with lesser amounts of illite.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 11 inches (Ap, E, and BE horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 11 inches to 80 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, Bt5, Bt6 and Bt7 horizons);\nudic moisture regime.\nThese soils are prime farmland where the slopes are less than 6 percent.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
