  "OVERVIEW": "The Mackranch series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Mackranch soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Henningsen and Morwen soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have aquic conditions at depths of 76 to 100 cm from the soil surface.  Job soils are fine-loamy, have ochric epipedons, and endosaturation at depths between 90 and 150 cm from the soil surface.  Kazul soils are fine-loamy, have cambic horizons, and endosaturation at depths between 122 and 150 cm from the soil surface.  Whitmire soils have thick mollic epipedons and have strongly contrasting sandy material at depths between 50 and 76 cm from the soil surface."

Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  The water table drops below 100 cm in the fall.
