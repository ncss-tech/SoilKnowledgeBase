  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mackranch soils are on flood plains.  They formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks but with a strong influence from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,450 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

Henningsen and Morwen soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have aquic conditions at depths of 76 to 100 cm from the soil surface.  Job soils are fine-loamy, have ochric epipedons, and endosaturation at depths between 90 and 150 cm from the soil surface.  Kazul soils are fine-loamy, have cambic horizons, and endosaturation at depths between 122 and 150 cm from the soil surface.  Whitmire soils have thick mollic epipedons and have strongly contrasting sandy material at depths between 50 and 76 cm from the soil surface."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 50 and 76 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  The water table drops below 100 cm in the fall.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mackranch soils are used for irrigated pasture, hayland, and wildlife habitat.  The native vegetation is mainly willows, cottonwood, sedges, rushes, and grasses.  The vegetation in cultivated areas is mainly legume-grass hay or improved pasture.  These soils are also a source for gravel (aggregate) for concrete manufacture."
