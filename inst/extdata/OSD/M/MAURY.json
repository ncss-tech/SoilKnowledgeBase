  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maury soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands. Slopes are commonly 0 to 12 percent, but range to 20 percent. The underlying limestone is cavernous and some areas have karst topography. The upper 10 to 20 inches of the solum formed in silty material and the lower part formed in residuum weathered from phosphatic limestone. The phosphatic limestone members include the Lexington and Cynthiana Limestone Formations of the Inner Bluegrass Physiographic Region.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F."

Donerail soils have a dark colored surface layer, are moderately well drained, have an average of more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and have hues of 10YR or yellower in the subsoil.
