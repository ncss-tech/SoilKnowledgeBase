    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to 120 inches or more.  Thickness of the argillic horizon ranges from 50 to 100 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 60 to 200 inches or more.  Chert fragments, less than 3 inches in diameter, range from 0 to 5 percent in the Bt, BC and C horizons.  The reaction of the Ap or A horizons range from neutral to strongly acid; the upper part of the Bt horizon ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid; the lower part of the Bt, BC and C horizons range from moderately acid to very strongly acid.  The phosphate content in the solum is variable but is typically medium or high.\nThe Ap or A horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma from 2 to 4.  Some pedons have Ap or A horizons less than 7 inches thick with a value of 3 after mixing.\nThe AB or BA horizons, where present, have a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam or light silty clay loam.\nThe upper part of Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is light silty clay loam to clay.\nThe lower part of the Bt, BC, and C horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is heavy silty clay loam to clay.  Some pedons are mottled in shades of red, brown or yellow, or are a variegation of these colors.\nSome pedons in the transition zone between the Inner and Outer Bluegrass Physiographic Regions have lower Bt, BC, and C horizons with hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Many pedons have few to many, fine to coarse, black iron and manganese oxide nodules, masses or concretions."

The Bluegrass Series has less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  The Lowell Series has hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt horizon.  The Faywood Series has hue of 7.5YR or yellower and is moderately deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maury soils are on nearly level to moderately steep uplands. Slopes are commonly 0 to 12 percent, but range to 20 percent. The underlying limestone is cavernous and some areas have karst topography. The upper 10 to 20 inches of the solum formed in silty material and the lower part formed in residuum weathered from phosphatic limestone. The phosphatic limestone members include the Lexington and Cynthiana Limestone Formations of the Inner Bluegrass Physiographic Region.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F."

Ashton soils are located on low stream terraces and alluvial fans, have a dark colored surface layer, and have a solum thickness of 40 to 60 inches.  Bluegrass soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Caleast soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone interbedded with thin strata of calcareous shale and siltstone, have a dark colored surface layer, have an average of more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and have a solum thickness of 40 and 60 inches.  Donerail soils have a dark colored surface layer, are moderately well drained, have an average of more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and have hues of 10YR or yellower in the subsoil.  Elk soils are located on stream terraces, and are typically more acid.  Fairmount soils formed in limestone residuum interbedded with thin layers of calcareous shales, have a solum thickness and depth to bedrock from 10 to 20 inches, have a dark colored surface layer, have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, and do not have argillic horizons.  Faywood soils have hues of 7.5YR yellower in the Bt horizon and are moderately deep.  Loradale soils formed in residuum or old alluvium from limestone and thin layers of calcareous shale, have a dark colored surface layer, and have hues of 10YR or yellower in the subsoil.  Lowell soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone interbedded with thin layers of shale, have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, have a solum thickness of 30 to 60 inches, and have hues of 7.5YR or yellower in the lower part of the subsoil.  McAfee soils have a solum thickness and depth to bedrock from 20 to 40 inches, have a dark colored surface layer, and have an average of more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section.

Bluegrass and white clover are the most common pasture plants.  Native vegetation was dominated by oaks, elm, ash, black walnut, black and honey locust, hackberry, black cherry, and Kentucky coffee tree.  Glades of native grasses and canes were reported by early settlers."
