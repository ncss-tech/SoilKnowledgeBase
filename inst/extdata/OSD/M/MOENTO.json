(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nMoento soils have a frigid soil temperature regime and an ustic soil moisture regime.\nNote: In this pedon it is assumed the A1 horizon displays the greatest amount of eluviation and that the clay increase, required for a diagnostic argillic horizon, is measured from the A1 horizon to the Bt1 horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
