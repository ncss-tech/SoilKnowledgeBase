  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Moento series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and landslide deposits over residuum derived from sandstone. These soils are on dip slopes, structural benches, mountain slopes and landslides. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 533 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
