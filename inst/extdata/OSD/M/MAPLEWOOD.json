  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the Ex or 2Btx horizon ranges from 16 to 40 inches.  Chert gravel by volume is 0 to 10 percent in the A and Bt horizons; 2 to 65 percent in the 2Btx horizon; and 0 to 40 percent in the 3Bt and 4Bt horizons.  Chert cobble by volume is less than 5 percent in the A and Bt horizons, but ranges to 40 percent in the 2Btx horizon and up to 50 percent in the 3Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has color value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly is silt loam, but includes silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  An E horizon is present in some pedons that have not been cultivated.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  Some pedons have an Ex horizon.\nThe 2Btx horizon has mottled colors with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 2 to 8. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogues.   Coarse fragments are often horizontally oriented and there is variable moderately expressed brittleness in 30 to 60 percent of the fine material.  Reaction is medium acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt, 3Bt, or 4Bt horizons (where present) have hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 with mottles of lower chroma in some pedons.  It is silty clay, clay, or their gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly analogues.  Reaction is medium acid to slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maplewood soils are on concave sideslopes in heads of drainageways.  Slopes range from 2 to 9 percent.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess, colluvium, and the underlying loamy and clayey residuum from limestone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 42 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Friendly, Hartwell and Paintbrush series.  Friendly soils have an abrupt textural change and are on higher, broadly concave areas. Paintbrush soils are fine-loamy, browner in the upper Bt horizon and are on lower areas in the landscape where slopes are linear or convex. Hartwell soils are darker in the upper Bt horizon, do not have a lithologic discontinuity and are higher in the landscape."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  A large portion of these soils is used for grass and legume pasture or hay crops.  The remaining acreage is used mostly for grain sorghum, soybeans, and small grains.  Native vegetation is mixed grasses and hardwood trees."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification was changed from an Aquollic Hapludalf based on revisions to the 1998 Keys to Taxonomy.\nThe sequence and nomenclature of the lithologic discontinuities may differ depending on whether the upper part of the Btx is considered to be a part of the residuum or part of the loess.  As many as four materials could be designated.  The intent of any labeling should be consistent with the concept of the dense layer in the profile.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon);\nargillic horizon - the zone from 6 to 67 inches (Bt1, Bt2, 2Btx1, 2Btx2, 3Bt1, 3Bt2 and 3Bt3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of Missouri soil characterization laboratory reference number M8815922.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
