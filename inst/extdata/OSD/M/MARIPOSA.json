  "OVERVIEW": "The Mariposa series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from metasedimentary rocks. These soils are on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Cohasset and Musick soils have a base saturation (by sum of cations) of more than 35 percent in the lower argillic horizon. Aiken, Cohasset and McCarthy occur on lahars. Jocal and Sites occur on mountain slopes and formed from metasedimentary rocks. Sites soils occur on more stable summits and backslopes and have greater than 35 percent clay in the upper argillic horizon."
