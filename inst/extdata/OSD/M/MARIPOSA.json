Maymen soils are 50 cm or less to a paralithic contact (metamorphic or sedimentary rocks). Laughlin, Maymen and McCarthy soils do not have argillic horizons. Cohasset and Musick soils have a base saturation (by sum of cations) of more than 35 percent in the lower argillic horizon. Aiken, Cohasset and McCarthy occur on lahars. Jocal and Sites occur on mountain slopes and formed from metasedimentary rocks. Sites soils occur on more stable summits and backslopes and have greater than 35 percent clay in the upper argillic horizon."
