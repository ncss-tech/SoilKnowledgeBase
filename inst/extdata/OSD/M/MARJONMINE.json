  "OVERVIEW": "The Marjonmine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from schist. The Marjonmine soils are on mountain slopes and slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
