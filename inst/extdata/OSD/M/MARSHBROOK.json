  "OVERVIEW": "The Marshbrook series consists of deep, somewhat poorly or poorly drained soils that formed in material weathered mainly from slate, quartzite and schist on flood plains.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 50 inches thick.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  The control section typically is loam or clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 55 percent sand, with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in most subhorizons of the control section and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.  Organic matter decreases uniformly with depth and usually is greater than .3 percent at depth of 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y to 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or less.  It is loam or clay loam and is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  It has common distinct to many prominent mottles in the lower part.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or less.  It typically is loam or clay loam but some pedons have lenses of silt loam or fine sandy loam.  It has common distinct to many prominent mottles.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, loam or clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

Kovich soils have a stratified control section in which organic material decreases irregularly with depth and have loamy-skeletal substratums above a depth of 40 inches.  Marshdale soils have a drier soil moisture control section for a longer period.  Sibannac soils are moderately or slightly acid and have irregular decrease of organic carbon content with depth.  Welch soils have a stratified control section in which organic matter decreases irregularly with depth and have a significant component of volcanic ash."

The soils formed in thick medium to moderately fine textured noncalcareous materials weathered principally from slate, quartzite, and schist.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 26 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.
