  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Color of the A1 horizon may range in hue from 10YR to 2.5Y, in chroma from 1 to 2, and in value from 5 to 6 dry and 4 to 5 moist.  Hue of the Ccag horizon ranges from 5Y to 10YR.  These soils should have mottling above 20 inches.  Reaction of the control section ranges from pH 8.0 to pH 8.6.  Content of organic carbon ranges from .7 to 1.5 percent in the upper 15 inches and decreases regularly with depth.  Conductivity ranges from less than 1 to 3 millimhos in the control section.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the strongest part of the Cca horizon is typically about 10 percent but may range from 6 to 14 percent with the content of calcium carbonate decreasing with depth.  Exchange capacity ranges from 8 to 20 milliequivalents per 100 grams of soil in the control section.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from less than 1 in the surface horizon to 1 to 5 percent in the Cca horizon.  Exchangeable sodium increases with depth.  Texture of the control section is typically a loam but may range in clay from 18 to 35 percent, in silt from 20 to 55 percent, and in sand from 20 to 50 percent.  content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the control section.  There should be no bedrock or strongly contrasting substratums above 40 inches in these soils."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The McKinney soils occur on flood plains or low terraces bordering streams that drain sedimentary beds.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  They are developing in alluvial fan materials.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 15 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer months.  Average annual soil temperature is 37 degrees F., and the average summer soil temperature is 58 degrees F."
