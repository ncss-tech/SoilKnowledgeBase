  "OVERVIEW": "The Madras series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on upland terraces and plateaus.  They formed in windblown deposits over volcaniclastic sediments from the Deschutes Formation.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section is usually dry and is dry in all parts for 120 to 150 days (cumulative) in the 4 months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick. The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of 3 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It is sandy loam and loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  It contains 10 to 30 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate and has an acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of less than 0.4 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 dry and 3 moist, and chroma of 4 dry and moist.  It is loam, clay loam, or cobbly loam or clay loam.   Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 25 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

Bissell, Cowiche, Margerum, Orr, Springmeyer, Truax, and Wenatchee soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock.  Bjork, Noslo, Pahrange, and Uhaldi soils lack the lithic contact below the paralithic layer.  Indiano soils are slightly acid or neutral, typically have a stony or very stony surface and have formed in colluvium from rhyolitic rocks.  Simcoe soils lack the thin paralithic layer above the lithic rock."

These soils formed in medium textured eolian materials and are underlain by gravels and basalt of the Deschutes Formation.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  Elevations range from 2000 to 3,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."

(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nDeschutes Formation - semiconsolidated water-laid sediments composed of sands, gravels, and silts of volcanic origin, and reworked volcanic materials. Interbedded basalts and ash-flow tuffs are included in this formation.\nThis draft (2/92) reflects a change in classification from fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Xerollic Durargids based on the presence of a mollic epipedon from 0 to 10 inches and review of the duripan.  The pan is considered to be geologic Deschutes Formation material."
