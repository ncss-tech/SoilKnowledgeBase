  "OVERVIEW": "The Mesahchie series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and reworked glacial drift over glacial drift on valley walls, debris cones, fan terraces, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 25 to 65 percent on valley walls and debris cones and 5 to 15 percent on fan terraces and alluvial fans.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1,450 millimeters.  The mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
