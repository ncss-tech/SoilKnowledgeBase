Bertolotti soils lack an umbric epipedon and contain angular gneiss and granitic rock fragments. Cliffdell soils have 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section. Deroux, Littlejohn, Mountaineer, Pheeney, and Umpa soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Goode soils lack an umbric epipedon. Pitcher soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days in the moisture control section, contain angular rock fragments of extrusive igneous origin, and lack an umbric epipedon. Roxer soils lack an umbric epipedon and have 7 to 10 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Scotties soils lack an umbric epipedon and are deep to a lithic contact."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mesahchie soils are on valley walls, debris cones, alluvial fans, and fan terraces at elevations of 365 to 1100 meters.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and reworked glacial drift over glacial drift.  The climate consists of cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 600 to 1,600 millimeters, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 10 degrees C. Frost free season is 70 to 100 days."
