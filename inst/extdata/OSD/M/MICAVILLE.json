  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is commonly 20 to 40 inches, but ranges from 20 to 55 inches. Depth to paralithic contact (Cr) ranges from 40 to 60 inches below the surface. Depth to lithic contact (R) is more than 60 inches. Flakes of mica range from few to many in the A horizon and are many in the B and C horizons. Content of rock fragments is less than 35 percent by volume. They are commonly pebbles and channers, but include cobbles or stones. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid throughout, except where surface layers have been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Horizons with value of 3 or less, are less than 7 inches thick. Fine-earth texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Fine-earth texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Fine-earth texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BC horizon or the CB horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Fine-earth texture is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, is multicolored or it has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 8 and may be variegated or mottled in shades of these colors. Fine-earth texture is loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, multicolored, micaceous, high-grade metamorphic rock such as mica schist, mica gneiss, and pegmatite. It is partially consolidated, but can be dug with difficulty by hand tools. The upper boundary is considered as a paralithic contact where root spacing is greater than 4 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Chandler and Manor series in the same family. Brownwood, Cashiers, Fannin, Mt. Airy, and Watauga series are in closely related families. Chandler soils are do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches of the surface. Manor soils have hue of 5YR or redder. Brownwood soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches below the surface. Cashiers soils have an A horizon with value of 3 that is 7 to 10 inches thick and are very deep to bedrock. Fannin and Watauga soils have argillic horizons. Mt. Airy soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Micaville soils are on ridges and side slopes in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). Slopes are dominantly 15 to 75 percent, but range from 8 to 95 percent. Elevation ranges from 1,400 to 4,200 feet. Micaville soils formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part, and are weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks having a high mica content such as mica schist, mica gneiss, and pegmatite. The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 47 to 57 degrees F., the frost free season ranges from about 110 to 160 days, and average annual rainfall ranges from about 48 to 64 inches."

Ashe, Buladean, Chestnut, Cleveland, Cowee, Edneyville, and Evard soils are on landscape positions similar to Micaville, but contain less mica and are in different mineralogy families. Cullasaja, Saunook, Thunder, Tuckasegee, and Tusquitee soils formed in colluvium, contain less mica, and are in different mineralogy families."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat excessively drained. Permeability is moderately rapid. Runoff class is low on strong and moderately steep slopes and medium on steeper slopes. Runoff is much lower where forest litter has little or no disturbance."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Micaville soils are forested. Common trees are chestnut oak, white oak, scarlet oak, black oak, hickory, eastern white pine, Virginia pine, and pitch pine. Yellow poplar and northern red oak are common in the northern portions of  MLRA 130. The dominant understory is flowering dogwood, mountain-laurel, rhododendron, and sourwood. Some small areas are in pasture, hayland, or cultivated crops. The major crops grown are native ornamentals, and Christmas trees."
