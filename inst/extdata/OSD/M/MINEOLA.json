  "OVERVIEW": "The Mineola series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on outwash plains. These soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy outwash deposits overlying stratified sand and gravel. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches and corresponds to the depth to stratified sand and gravel. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches and is mainly several hundred feet. Redoximorphic features consisting of concentrations of iron oxides occur between 18 and 30 inches of the soil surface. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A horizon and from 0 to 75 percent for individual layers in the B and C horizons. Rock fragments are mainly gravel of granitic origin with up to 20 percent cobblestones in the B and C horizons. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or coarse granular.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Structure is weak fine granular or subangular blocky.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 4 through 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loamy sand, sand or coarse sand."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mineola soils are on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in a thin loamy mantle over stratified sand and gravel outwash materials. Typically, the soils are along the bottoms of old glacial melt water channels. The climate is cool, temperate, and humid. Mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 55 degrees F.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 44 inches; and the frost-free period ranges from 180 to 220 days. These soils are at elevations that range from 5 to 200 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Atsion, Deerfield, Hempstead, Sudbury, Riverhead and Plymouth soils. Atsion, Deerfield, and Sudbury soils are on nearby landscapes but lack the thick dark colored (umbric) surface layer of the Mineola soils. Hempstead soils occur on nearby better drained landscapes and contain less sand and gravel. Riverhead soils have thicker loamy mantles over stratified sand and gravel, lack an umbric epipedon and are better drained. Plymouth soils lack an umbric epipedon, contain fewer rock fragments and are better drained."

Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Umbric epipedon - from 0 to 11 inches (A1, A2, AB horizons)\n2) Oxyaquic subgroup - as evidenced by redoximorphic concentrations from 21 to 40 inches (C2 horizon)\nSoil Interpretation Record No: NY032"
