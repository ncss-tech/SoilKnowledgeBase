    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons and from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the B horizons.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Ironstone fragments range from 0 to 20 percent of the volume.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam with ironstone fragments ranging from 0 to 20 percent of the volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10R, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles in shades of brown or yellow range from none to common. The upper part is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay. The lower part is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam with ped coatings and streaks or pockets of yellowish or grayish sand or fine sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, or it is mottled in shades of red, yellow, or gray. It is sandy loam, sandy clay, sandy clay loam, or fine sandy loam with streaks or pockets of less clayey material.\nA C or Cd horizon is present below a depth of 60 inches in some pedons. It has dominant colors in shades of brown or gray with lithochromic mottles and/or strata of these colors and with or without yellowish colors. The material is unconsolidated to weakly consolidated and slakes in water. Texture ranges from fine sandy loam to silty clay loam. The reaction is highly variable and ranges from extremely acid to neutral."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Canton Bend, Cowton, Gundy, Magnet, Skyuka, Spray, Sugartown, and Zuber series in the same family, and the Brantley, Capshaw, Enon, Hampshire, Maben, Mecklenburg, and Zion series in closely related families. Brantley, Capshaw, Enon, Hampshire and Mecklenburg soils have a solum less than 60 inches thick. In addition Brantley, Hampshire, and Mecklenburg soils have a CEC:clay ratio more than o.40 in the control section, Capshaw soils have a seasonally saturated layer within a depth of 40 inches, and Hampshire soils have bedrock within a depth of 60 inches. Skyuka soils formed in old alluvium washed from upland soils dominantly underlain by dark colored high grade metamorphic rocks. Canton Bend soils have more than 30 percent silt in the control section. Cowtown soils have a solum 20 to 40 inches thick over paralithic shale. Gundy soils have a paralithic contact to Carolina slate rock at 40 to 60 inches deep. Maben soils have a solum lass than 48 inches thick over weathered shale. Magnet soils have a solum that is less than 50 inches thick over syenitic saprolite and other igneous rocks. Spray soils have a solum that is less than 30 inches thick over partially weathered shale. Sugartown and Zuber soils have matrix hue yellower than 5YR in the solum, and do not have a 20 percent clay decrease within a depth of 60 inches. Zion soils have hard mafic bedrock at 20 to 40 inches deep."
