Hobcan soils have gypsic horizons closer to the surface (8 to 16 inches).  Monzingo soils contain Cd horizons.  Alamogordo, Borderline, and Ugyp soils' depth to gypsic horizon is less than 10 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Monahans soils are on nearly level to gently sloping upland plains and fan skirts on fan piedmonts.  Most slopes are less than 2 percent but range up to about 5 percent.  The regolith consists of calcareous and gypsiferous old alluvium and basin deposits from limestone and igneous mountains.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 7 to 12 inches.  Frost free days range from 200 to 240 days, and elevation ranges from 2,000 to 4,000 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices are less than 25."

Hoban soils are on similar or slightly lower positions, have fine-silty control sections and do not contain significant amounts of gypsum.  Hodgins soils are on slightly lower positions and have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Holloman soils are on similar positions and are shallow to gypsiferous sediments.  Pajarito soils are on similar positions and do not have gypsic horizons.  Reeves soils are on similar positions.  Upton soils are at slightly higher elevations and have petrocalcic horizons within 20 inches."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Primarily used for livestock grazing, which is of low productive capacity.  Some areas are used for irrigated cropland.  Rangeland vegetation is desert shrubs, such as creosote bush, four-wing salt bush, small mesquite trees, tarbush, and sparse grasses such as bush muhly, plains bristlegrass, black grama, sand dropseed, mesa dropseed, perennial threeawns, hooded windmill, and fluffgrass.  Irrigated crops are mainly cotton, grain sorghums, and alfalfa."

The data indicates the soils have a silicate clay content less than 18 percent, and a calcic horizon above and within the gypsic horizon.\nSoil Interpretation Record Number: TX0135\nUpdated competing series section 3/13/08, CEM.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nRevised for the correlation of Hudspeth County, Texas (Main Part) and Culberson County, Texas (Main Part); July, 2012, NMS\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
