  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bucknell, Gifford, Kilwinning, Kniffin, Leonard, Pershing, Rathbun, Rinda, Shields, and Stateline series. Bucknell soils are less than 203 centimeters (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and formed in paleosols derived from till. Gifford soils formed in loess and silty sediments or alluvium on stream terraces. Kilwinning soils formed entirely in loess, allow 2.5Y hue in the upper Btg horizon, and are typically less acid in the lower part of the series control section. Kniffin, Pershing and Rathbun soils are more than 152 centimeters (60 inches) to a lithologic discontinuity and formed in more than 152 centimeters (60 inches) of loess. Leonard soils are 30 to 76 centimeters (12 to 30 inches) deep to a paleosol containing till pebbles. Rinda soils are less than 46 centimeters (18 inches) to a lithologic discontinuity and formed in thin loess or silty sediments and the underlying paleosol formed in till. Shields soils have carbonates above a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches) and formed in till. Stateline soils are less than 203 centimeters (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and formed in loess or loamy sediments and the underlying clayey paleosol."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mexico soils are on ridges and hillsides of dissected till plains. These soils formed in 71 to 152 centimeters (28 to 60 inches) of loess over loamy sediments derived from pre-Illinoian till. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1020 millimeters (35 to 40 inches)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Armstrong, Gara, Leonard, Lindley and Putnam soils. The somewhat poorly drained Armstrong, the moderately well drained Gara, and the well drained Lindley soils have more sand in the upper part of the solum and are down slope. Leonard soils are 30 to 76 centimeters (12 to 30) inches to a paleosol containing till pebbles. Putnam soils have an abrupt textural change. Leonard soils are down slope and Putnam soils are on the main divides upslope from Mexico soils."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) is 0.01 to 0.42 micrometers per second. In undisturbed areas a perched water table has an upper limit of 15 to 61 centimeters (0.5 to 1.5 feet) during December to May in most years."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: With this revision, the Mexico Series is reclassified as Fine, smectitic, mesic Vertic Epiaqualfs and the type location is moved to a more representative site. This series was previously classified as Fine, smectitic, mesic Aeric Vertic Epiaqualfs. The previous typical pedon lacked lab data and the location was uncertain. This more representative pedon with lab data is approximately 2.4 miles east by northeast of the previous type location.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 centimeters (9 inches) (Ap horizon);\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 23 to 203 centimeters (9 to 80 inches) (Btg, and 2Btg horizons).\nClaypan  the zone from 36 to 86 centimeters (14 to 34 inches) (Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons).\nLithologic discontinuity  occurs at a depth of 107 centimeters (42 inches) (top of 2Btg1 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: LAB SAMPLE NUMBER M0513904 (University of Missouri Lab) is data for the typical pedon. LAB SAMPLE NUMBERS MO500706, MO500708, MO500709, MO502703, MO511302, MO511303, MO511304, MO513907, MO516302, MO521903, and MO602701 are additional data used for the series range in characteristics.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
