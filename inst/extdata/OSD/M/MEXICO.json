Bucknell soils are less than 203 centimeters (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and formed in paleosols derived from till. Gifford soils formed in loess and silty sediments or alluvium on stream terraces. Kilwinning soils formed entirely in loess, allow 2.5Y hue in the upper Btg horizon, and are typically less acid in the lower part of the series control section. Kniffin, Pershing and Rathbun soils are more than 152 centimeters (60 inches) to a lithologic discontinuity and formed in more than 152 centimeters (60 inches) of loess. Leonard soils are 30 to 76 centimeters (12 to 30 inches) deep to a paleosol containing till pebbles. Rinda soils are less than 46 centimeters (18 inches) to a lithologic discontinuity and formed in thin loess or silty sediments and the underlying paleosol formed in till. Shields soils have carbonates above a depth of 152 centimeters (60 inches) and formed in till. Stateline soils are less than 203 centimeters (80 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and formed in loess or loamy sediments and the underlying clayey paleosol."

This series was previously classified as Fine, smectitic, mesic Aeric Vertic Epiaqualfs. The previous typical pedon lacked lab data and the location was uncertain. This more representative pedon with lab data is approximately 2.4 miles east by northeast of the previous type location.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 centimeters (9 inches) (Ap horizon);\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 23 to 203 centimeters (9 to 80 inches) (Btg, and 2Btg horizons).\nClaypan  the zone from 36 to 86 centimeters (14 to 34 inches) (Btg2, Btg3, and Btg4 horizons).\nLithologic discontinuity  occurs at a depth of 107 centimeters (42 inches) (top of 2Btg1 horizon)."
