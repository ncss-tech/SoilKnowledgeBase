  "OVERVIEW": "The Manorcreek series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic materials over glaciolacustrine deposits.  They are in closed wet depressions on till plains. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 120 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F and the mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F. The difference between the mean winter and summer soil temperature is 7 to 9 degrees F. These soils are always moist, and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; peraquic soil moisture regime. Depth to dense or cemented till is greater than 60 inches. Depth to the mineral material is 24 to 36 inches. The surface tier (0 to 20 cm, or 0 to 12 inches) contains fibric, hemic and sapric material with the combination of fibric and hemic material making over 50 percent of the thickness. The subsurface tier (30 to 90 cm, or 12 to 36 inches) contains only sapric material with mineral soil material present at a depth of 24 to 36 inches. The bottom tier (90 to 130 cm, 36 to 52 inches or more) is mineral soil material consisting of silt or silt loam.\nThe Oe horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist either broken, rubbed, or pressed. It is ultra acid or extremely acid.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 10YR moist, value of 2 or 2.5 moist, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist either broken, rubbed, or pressed. It is ultra acid or extremely acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist, value of 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist. It is silt or silt loam and strongly or moderately acid."
