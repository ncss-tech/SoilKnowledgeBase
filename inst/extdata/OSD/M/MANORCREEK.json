(1/2 to 2 inches thick)\nOe-- 1 to 9 inches; very dusky red (2.5YR 2.5/2) mucky peat (same color whether evaluating a broken face, rubbed, or pressed); 35 percent fibers unrubbed, 20 percent fibers rubbed; dries irreversibly; many very fine, fine, medium, and coarse roots; extremely acid (pH 3.5); abrupt smooth boundary.

The mean summer soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F and the mean winter soil temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F. The difference between the mean winter and summer soil temperature is 7 to 9 degrees F. These soils are always moist, and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; peraquic soil moisture regime. Depth to dense or cemented till is greater than 60 inches. Depth to the mineral material is 24 to 36 inches. The surface tier (0 to 20 cm, or 0 to 12 inches) contains fibric, hemic and sapric material with the combination of fibric and hemic material making over 50 percent of the thickness. The subsurface tier (30 to 90 cm, or 12 to 36 inches) contains only sapric material with mineral soil material present at a depth of 24 to 36 inches. The bottom tier (90 to 130 cm, 36 to 52 inches or more) is mineral soil material consisting of silt or silt loam.\nThe Oe horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist either broken, rubbed, or pressed. It is ultra acid or extremely acid.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 10YR moist, value of 2 or 2.5 moist, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist either broken, rubbed, or pressed. It is ultra acid or extremely acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist, value of 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist. It is silt or silt loam and strongly or moderately acid."
