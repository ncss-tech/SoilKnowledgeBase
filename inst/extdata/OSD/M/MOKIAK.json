Cobbles and gravel in the argillic horizon range from 45 to 85 percent The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F. The soils are usually dry during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. They are moist in some part of the moisture control section for 30 to 40 days during the summer months and are dry for 70 to 85 days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has weak and moderate very fine through coarse subangular blocky structure ."

Irock soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have a solum 20 to 30 inches thick. Majada soils have a calcic horizon below the argillic horizon.  Montoso soils have a solum 9 to 20 inches thick and have cinders ill the control section. Murdo and Nederland soils are deeper than 40 inches to a lithic contact. Santa Fe and Motoqua soils are less than 20 inches deep to a lithic contact. Salas soils have a horizon of carbonate accumulation."
