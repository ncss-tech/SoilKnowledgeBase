Cobbles and gravel in the argillic horizon range from 45 to 85 percent The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F. The soils are usually dry during the period the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. They are moist in some part of the moisture control section for 30 to 40 days during the summer months and are dry for 70 to 85 days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has weak and moderate very fine through coarse subangular blocky structure ."
