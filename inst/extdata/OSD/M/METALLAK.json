  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 35 inches and generally corresponds to the depth to the contrasting material.  Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum; and from 0 to 75 percent in individual horizons in the contrasting material with a weighted average of 35 percent or more within 40 inches from the surface.  The soil ranges from strongly acid through neutral throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2C horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 8.  Texture ranges from fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Thin strata (less than 4 inches thick) of sandy, loamy, or silty textures are below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Abenaki, Cohas, Colton and Podunk series.  The well drained Abenaki and poorly drained Cohas soils are in a drainage sequence with the Metallak soils. Abenaki soils are in slightly higher positions on alluvial terraces, and Cohas soils are on slightly lower positions on alluvial terraces.  Colton soils have spodic horizons and are on adjacent glacial outwash terraces.  Podunk soils are in similar positions on the landscape as Metallak soils, but have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are: a.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 11 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 11 to 23 inches (Bw horizon).\nc. Strongly contrasting particle-size class - the zone from 11 to 23 inches is coarse-loamy, and the zone from 23 to 40 inches is sandy-skeletal.\nd. Aquic feature - redox depletions within 24 inches of the soil surface (2C horizon).\n2.  The Metallak series was formerly mapped as Podunk Variant in New Hampshire.  700 acres of this soil are correlated as Podunk Variant in Carroll County, New Hampshire.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
