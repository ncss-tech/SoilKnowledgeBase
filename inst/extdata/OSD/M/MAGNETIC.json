  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The combined thickness of the organic horizons ranges from 8 to 16 inches.  The depth to bedrock ranges from 14 to 20 inches below the mineral surface.  The organic mat may be as thick or thicker than the mineral soil, but is never more than twice as thick as the mineral soil above the lithic contact.  The profile is very strongly or extremely acid throughout.\nThe Oe horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizon has hue from 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is commonly fine sandy loam but ranges to include loamy sand.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 15 to 35 percent gravel."

Hydaburg and Kina are saturated organic soils on sideslopes of hills and mountains.  Kaikli and Maybeso are forested organic soils on valley sideslopes.  Karta and Tokeen are well drained, forested, mineral soils on backslopes and footslopes of mountains."
