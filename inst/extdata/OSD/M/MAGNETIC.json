  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Magnetic series consists of shallow to bedrock, very poorly drained soils formed in residuum from phyllite or schist and overlain with a thick organic layer.  Magnetic soils are on ridgetops and shoulder slopes of mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  The combined thickness of the organic horizons ranges from 8 to 16 inches.  The depth to bedrock ranges from 14 to 20 inches below the mineral surface.  The organic mat may be as thick or thicker than the mineral soil, but is never more than twice as thick as the mineral soil above the lithic contact.  The profile is very strongly or extremely acid throughout.\nThe Oe horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizon has hue from 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is commonly fine sandy loam but ranges to include loamy sand.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 15 to 35 percent gravel."
