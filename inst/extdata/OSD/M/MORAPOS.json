  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Morapos soils are on structural benches, hills, plateaus, and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The soil formed in slope alluvium and residuum from shale and siltstone, with admixture of loess in some pedons. Elevation ranges from 6,300 to 7,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches and is evenly distributed throughout the year except for a slight decline in July. Over half of the precipitation is received as snow. Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 43 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 67 degrees F. The frost free season is 65 to 110 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Climatic conditions are close to fitting that of the xeric moisture regime. Snow cover occurs in October before the moisture control section becomes moistened in all parts; hence it has no opportunity to be moist in all parts for 3 of the 4 months after the winter solstice. Snow melt occurs in mid-April to mid-May and moistens the control section and below. Increased evapotranspiration dries out the control section by mid-July. Summer precipitation comes as irregular showers which are not sufficient to moisten the soil down to the top of the control section. As evapotranspiration decreases in late September, the showers moisten the soil down into the top part of the moisture control section.\nThe 10/2002 revision restricts the series characteristics to northwestern Colorado, where it was proposed and established. It will not be correlated in southwestern Colorado in the future. This change mainly affected the climatic setting and the vegetation.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches.\nArgillic horizon - from 5 to 23 inches.\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 5 to 23 inches (the entire argillic horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
