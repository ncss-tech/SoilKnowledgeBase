  "OVERVIEW": "The Morapos series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived dominantly from shale and siltstone, with admixture of loess in some pedons. Morapos soils are on structural benches, hills, plateaus, and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Climatic conditions are close to fitting that of the xeric moisture regime. Snow cover occurs in October before the moisture control section becomes moistened in all parts; hence it has no opportunity to be moist in all parts for 3 of the 4 months after the winter solstice. Snow melt occurs in mid-April to mid-May and moistens the control section and below. Increased evapotranspiration dries out the control section by mid-July. Summer precipitation comes as irregular showers which are not sufficient to moisten the soil down to the top of the control section. As evapotranspiration decreases in late September, the showers moisten the soil down into the top part of the moisture control section.\nThe 10/2002 revision restricts the series characteristics to northwestern Colorado, where it was proposed and established. It will not be correlated in southwestern Colorado in the future. This change mainly affected the climatic setting and the vegetation.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches.\nArgillic horizon - from 5 to 23 inches.\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 5 to 23 inches (the entire argillic horizon)."
