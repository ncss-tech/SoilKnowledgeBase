  "OVERVIEW": "The Manitowish series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils which are shallow to sandy outwash.  They formed in a thin mantle of loamy alluvium or eolian deposits, or both and in the underlying sand or stratified sandy outwash on outwash terraces and outwash plains.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash. Slopes range from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  Thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle.  Volume of gravel ranges from 10 to 35 percent (as a weighted average) in the sandy outwash but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the loamy mantle but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the sandy outwash. Redox accumulations and saturation occur below the spodic horizon but within 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma is 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam but in some pedons it is the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4. Texture is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam but in some pedons it is the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Bs horizon has color like the Bs horizon described above.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, sand or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 8.  Horizons with value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 do not meet the requirements for spodic materials. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Typically Texture is stratified with sand or coarse sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.  Some pedons have strata of gravel."

These soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy alluvium or eolian deposits overlying sand or stratified sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 70 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 2000 feet."

The moderately well drained Croswell soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Manitowish soils where the loamy mantle is absent.  The well drained Padus soils, the moderately well drained Tipler soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Worcester soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the loamy mantle is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The somewhat excessively drained Pence soils and the somewhat poorly drained Wormet soils form a drainage sequence with Manitowish soils.  The excessively drained Sayner and Vilas soils are in higher landscape positions where the loamy mantle is absent.  The moderately well drained Padwet soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Manitowish soils where the loamy mantle is 20 to 40 inches thick over the outwash."
