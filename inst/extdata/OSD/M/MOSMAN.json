Coarse fragment content in the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 65 percent with 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble and stones.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Organic carbon content of the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon exceeds 6 percent.\nThe O horizon has hue ranging from 10R to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 2.5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue from 10YR to 5YR; value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is loam or silt loam with 20 to 50 percent coarse fragments.  The E horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue ranging from 2.5YR to 10YR; value and chroma moist from 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam with 35 to 70 percent coarse fragments.\nA Bs horizon is present in some pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mosman soils are on hillslopes and mountainsides.  These soils are formed in colluvium and residuum and are underlain by bedrock.  The climate is humid maritime with mean annual precipitation ranging from 60 to 150 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  Slope gradient ranges from 5 to 120 percent.  Elevationrange  from sea level to 2000 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Kupreanof, McGilvery, St. Nicholas, Tonowek, and Tuxekan soils.  Kupreanof soils lack a histic epipedon and are developed in deep till and colluvium on concave slopes.  McGilvery soils are on similar positions and consist of forest litter over bedrock.  St. Nicholas soils are at higher elevations and are poorly drained.  Tonowek and Tuxekan soils developed in alluvium on floodplains and stream terraces."

The overstory vegetation is dominantly western hemlock and Sitka spruce with lesser amounts of Alaska yellow cedar and western red cedar.  The understory vegetation is vaccinium, rusty menziesia, ferns, and mosses."
