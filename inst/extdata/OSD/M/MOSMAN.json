  "OVERVIEW": "The Mosman series consist of very shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum or colluvium.  Mosman soils are on mountain sideslopes and hillslopes.  Slope ranges from 5 to 120 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 110 inches.",

Coarse fragment content in the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 65 percent with 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobble and stones.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Organic carbon content of the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon exceeds 6 percent.\nThe O horizon has hue ranging from 10R to 10YR; value moist of 2 or 2.5; and chroma moist of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue from 10YR to 5YR; value moist from 4 to 6; and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is loam or silt loam with 20 to 50 percent coarse fragments.  The E horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue ranging from 2.5YR to 10YR; value and chroma moist from 2 to 4.

Kupreanof soils lack a histic epipedon and are developed in deep till and colluvium on concave slopes.  McGilvery soils are on similar positions and consist of forest litter over bedrock.  St. Nicholas soils are at higher elevations and are poorly drained.  Tonowek and Tuxekan soils developed in alluvium on floodplains and stream terraces."
