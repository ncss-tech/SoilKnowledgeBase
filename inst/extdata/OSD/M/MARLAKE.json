  "OVERVIEW": "The Marlake series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in sandy eolian deposits. They are in depressions on interdunes of sandhills and are ponded with water most of the growing season. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 48 centimeters (19 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.)",
