  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mineral solum ranges from 30 to 50 cm.  Depth to bedrock is more than 152 cm.  The weighted average of clay in the particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent.  Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 70 percent in the Eg and A horizons, where present, and are mainly pebble and cobble size.  Throughout the remainder of the mineral soil profile, rock fragments are mainly pebble size, the weighted average ranging from 5 to 35 percent. Some pedons have channers.  Stones and boulders cover 0 to 35 percent of the surface.\nThe Oe horizon, and Oa horizon, where present, have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They have weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe A and Ap horizons, where present, have hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  They have weak to strong, fine or medium granular structure and are very friable or friable.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid unless limed.\nThe Eg horizon, where present,  has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak thin or medium platy, weak fine subangular blocky, weak very fine or fine granular or weak very coarse prismatic structure or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is very friable to firm.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate, thin to very thick platy structure or very fine to medium subangular blocky, or weak very fine to medium granular or weak coarse prismatic parting to moderate medium platy.  Consistence is friable or firm, nonsticky or slightly sticky and nonplastic or slightly plastic.  Reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate, medium to very thick platy structure, or weak or moderate subangular blocky, or weak to strong, coarse or very coarse prismatic parting to weak or moderate, medium to very thick platy or it is massive.  Consistence is firm or very firm, nonsticky or slightly sticky and nonplastic or slightly plastic.  Some pedons have an E' horizon that has characteristics similar to those of the BC horizon.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Cd layer has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has weak or moderate, thin to very thick plates or weak to strong, coarse or very coarse prisms that may part to plates, all of which is interpreted as inherited from the parent material, or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is firm or very firm, slightly sticky and slightly plastic or plastic.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Monarda soils are on lower slopes or in slight depressions on till plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in dense glacial till derived mainly from slate, metasandstone, phyllite and shale with small amounts of granite, fine grained quartzite and sandstone.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1168 mm.  The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 36 to 762 m above mean sea level."

The Bangor, Chesuncook, Dixmont, Howland, Plaisted, and Telos soils are better drained and are in higher positions on the landscape.  Burnham soils are wetter soils in depressions.  Elliottsville, Monson, Penquis, Thorndike and Winnecook soils are better drained, shallower to bedrock and are in higher positions on the landscapes."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Mineral solum thickness range narrowed to insure single family placement (rev. 2/2007). It is recognized that historically the series concept included deeper members.  Family changed from coarse-loamy to loamy and great group from Epiaquepts to Endoaquepts with revision, 1/2005.  The Monarda soils are borderline between acid and nonacid with the majority of pedons tested being acid.  The current classification reflects this.\nNote the series Typical Pedon needs evaluation as it is not shallow.  See historical notes.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 15 cm (Oe and Eg horizons).\n2.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 15 to 51 cm (Bg1, Bg2 and BC horizons).\n3. Aquic conditions - redoximorphic features 8 cm below the mineral surface.\n4  Endosaturation - classification defaults to Endoaquepts as the densic contact is not applicable to diagnostic horizons and properties.\n5  Aeric feature - chroma of 4 in the BC horizon\n6 Densic contact - Cd layer at a depth of 51 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Source of data used in establishing taxonomic class and range in characteristics are Technical Bulletin 94, Maine Agricultural Experiment Station, unpublished data, Maine Agricultural Experiment Station and NRCS Characterization Data.\nSoil Interpretation Record numbers for the Monarda series are: Monarda, ME0011; Monarda, rubbly, ME0136; and Monarda, stony, ME0012.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
