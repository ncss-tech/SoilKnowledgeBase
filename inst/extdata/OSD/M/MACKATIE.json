  "OVERVIEW": "The Mackatie series consists of deep, well drained soils on mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from andesite with a mantle of volcanic ash in the surface.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist and are not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for as long as 45 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  Depth to weathered andesite bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  Thickness of the ashy material is 14 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section has 10 to 15 percent clay in the upper part and 25 to 35 percent clay in the lower contrasting part.  Soil reaction is moderately to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The moist bulk density is 0.80 to 0.90g/cc.  It has a phosphate retention of 70 to 90 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus 1/2 iron of 2 to 3 percent in the less than 2.0 mm fraction.  There is 30 to 50 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate in the 0.02 to 2.0 mm fraction.  The 15-bar water retention is 8 to 12 percent on air dried samples.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe AB horizon is similar to the A and has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam and has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It has a phosphate retention of 50 to 75 percent and acid oxalate aluminum plus 1/2 iron of 0.4 to 1 percent.  There is 5 to 15 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate.  The 15-bar water retention is 16 to 30 percent on air dried samples.\nThe 3C horizon, when present, has color similar to the 2Bt2 horizon.  It has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 45 to 60 percent cobbles."
