  "OVERVIEW": "The Moenkopie series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from sandstone and shale. Moenkopie soils are on mesas, plateaus, hills, and structural benches. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
