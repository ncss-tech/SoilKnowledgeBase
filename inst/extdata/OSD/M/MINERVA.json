  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The clay content of the control section ranges ranges from 25 to 35 percent and decreases with depth.  Base saturation in the Bt horizon ranges from 40 to 74 percent.\nThe combined thickness of the A and E horizons range from 10 to 20 inches.  Texture is loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral. The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 ot 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, or yellow range from none to common.  Average texture in the upper 20 inches of the Bt is sandy clay loam or clay loam but can be sandy clay in the upper part or fine sandy loam or loam in the lower part in some pedons.  Reaction is very strongly acid through medium acid.\nThe C horizon is sandy clay loam, loam fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.  It is red, gray, brown or yellow.  Reaction is very strongly acid through slightly acid. Some pedons contain thin interbedded layers of weakly consolidated sandstone."

Littleaxe, Stephenville and Weatherford soils have sandstone at depths of less than 60 inches.  Sediments underlying the Silawa soils are stratified.  The Bt horizons of Gasil and Konsil soil do not have clay content that decreases by as much as 20 percent from the maximum within a depth of 60 inches.  Rosanky soils have clayey upper Bt horizons."

The soils formed in sandy and loamy sediments of Eocene Age, mainly of the Wilcox Formation.  The climate is subhumid with average annual precipitation of 32 to 40 inches, and Thornthwaite PE indices of 52 to 64 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F."
