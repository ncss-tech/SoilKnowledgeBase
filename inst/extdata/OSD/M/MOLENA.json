  "STATES": "GA,NC,SC,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Molena series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on stream terraces of the Piedmont. These soils have reddish brown sand A horizons, and yellowish red loamy fine sand Bt horizons. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 72 inches. The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon has 10 percent or more weatherable minerals. Mica content ranges from none to common in the A and E horizons, and few to common in the B and C horizon. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, except surface layers that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 4. Where the moist value is 3 and dry value is 5, it is less than 6 inches thick. It is sand loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5YR value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6. It is sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 through 8. It commonly is loamy sand or loamy fine sand; but where lamellae are within the upper 10 inches, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or thin subhorizons of loam are permitted. Clay content of the particle size control section is 5 to 10 percent.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has the same color as the Bt, and the same texture as the lower part of the Bt.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8. It is loamy sand, fine sand, sand, coarse sand or gravelly sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Series in similar families include the Americus, Buncombe, Eustis, Gainesville, Lakeland, Lucy, Troup, and Wando series. Americus soils have siliceous mineralogy and a solum exceeding 72 inches in thickness. Buncombe, Lakeland, and Wando soils lack Bt horizons. In addition, Lakeland soils have siliceous mineralogy. Eustis soils have siliceous mineralogy and less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon. Gainesville soils lack argillic horizons and have mean annual soil temperature of more than 72 degrees F. Lucy and Troup soils have more than 10 percent clay in the control section and Bt horizons with textures of sandy loam or sandy clay loam."
