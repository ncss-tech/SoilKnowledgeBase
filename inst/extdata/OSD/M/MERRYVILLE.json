Exchangeable sodium percentage of the argillic horizon is commonly 6 to 15 percent, but ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Eg horizon and E part of B/E/E horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles in shades of brown, range from few to many.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Btg horizon and Btg part of the B/E horizon have hue of 10YR to 5 Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles, in shades of brown range from few to many.  Texture is commonly silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam, but some pedons have thin strata of silty clay loam or clay loam in the Btg horizon.\nThe 2BCg and 2Cg horizons have the same range in colors as the Btg horizon.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Merryville soils commonly are near Bearhead, Bernaldo, Besner, Bienville, Cahaba, Dubach, Estes, and Urbo soils.  Bearhead and Besner soils are on higher positions on mounds and elongated ridges, are well drained and have a coarse loamy control section.  The Bernaldo, Cahaba, and Dubach soils are at higher elevations and have fine loamy control sections.  Bienville soils are in higher positions and have sandy control sections.  Urbo soils are at lower elevations on floodplains and have a fine texture control section."
