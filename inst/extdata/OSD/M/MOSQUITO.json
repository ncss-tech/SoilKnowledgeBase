  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Liscum and Tanacross soils. Liscum soils occur in complex with Mosquito soils; the former usually occur in places where the influence of groundwater is sufficient to prevent formation of permafrost. Tanacross soils occur on slightly higher positions than Mosquito soils, and are more acid because their organic acids are less completely neutralized by bases from the groundwater."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons or features recognized in this profile include:\nHistic epipedon: 0 to 10 inches\nPermafrost: below 18 inches\nCryoturbation: evident by abrupt broken horizon boundaries.\nGroundwater discharge neutralizes organic acids in the organic horizon, and results in a higher pH of these horizons than in most other Ruptic Histoturbels in this region.  Because permafrost is relatively impermeable, groundwater must be discharged through associated unfrozen soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
