  "OVERVIEW": "The Milan series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in loamy Pleistocene alluvium on treads and risers of paleoterraces, in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A0. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 810 mm (32 in).",
