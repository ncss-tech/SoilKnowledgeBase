Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the A11, A12, and A2 horizons and are mainly less than 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It has few distinct to many prominent mottles.  This horizon is medium acid or strongly acid.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is typically clay, and has 40 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt, and 2 to 15 percent sand.  This horizon is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is typically clay, and has 35 to 60 percent clay.  This horizon is medium acid or strongly acid."

The soils formed in moderately thin noncalcareous fine textured materials originating as glacial till deposits over shale beds or as residuum from shale.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is 35 to 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 60 degrees F."
