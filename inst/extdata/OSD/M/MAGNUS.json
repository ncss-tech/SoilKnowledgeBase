  "OVERVIEW": "The Magnus series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly or slowly permeable soils formed in calcareous clayey alluvium.  These soils are on low terraces and flood plains and have slopes ranging from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 40 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  Some pedons have chroma of 1 in the lower part of the A horizon.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  In some pedons, the A horizon does not have carbonates.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or clay.  The Bw and BC horizons contain few to common fine nodules or threads of carbonates.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have Bk and BCk horizons.\nThe C horizon is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay. Some pedons contain thin strata of loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Gypsum segregations are in the C horizon in some pedons."

The Banks, Havrelon, Lohler and Velva soils are on nearby flood plains.  Farland, Mandan, Parshall and Savage soils are on nearby higher lying terraces.  Harriet and Straw soils are on the same terrace as the Magnus.  Banks, Farland, Havrelon, Mandan, Parshall and Velva soils have coarser textures and contain less than 35 percent clay.  Harriet soils have natric horizons.  Lohler soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Savage soils have argillic horizons.  Straw soils are fine-loamy."
