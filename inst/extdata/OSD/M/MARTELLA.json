  "OVERVIEW": "The Martella series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed volcanic ash over glacial lake sediments. Martella soils are on lake terraces and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",

Understory vegetation is Saskatoon serviceberry, creambush oceanspray, mountain alder, willow, common snowberry, ribes, mallow ninebark, wild rose and Oregon grape. Ground vegetation is mostly white spirea, strawberry, pippsisewa, pachystima, kinnikinnick, meadow rue, and pinegrass."
