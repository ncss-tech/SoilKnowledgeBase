Native overstory vegetation is Douglas-fir, lodgepole pine, western larch, grand fir, ponderosa pine, and western redcedar. Understory vegetation is Saskatoon serviceberry, creambush oceanspray, mountain alder, willow, common snowberry, ribes, mallow ninebark, wild rose and Oregon grape. Ground vegetation is mostly white spirea, strawberry, pippsisewa, pachystima, kinnikinnick, meadow rue, and pinegrass."
