Cline, Gotchell, and Tumarion soils receive summer moisture, and the moisture control section is moist in some part for at least 20 days cumulative. Crosgrain, Greyeagle and Longjim soils do not have a duripan underlain by bedrock. In addition, Crosgrain and Greyeagle soils have an indurated layer greater than 10 and 16 inches thick, respectively; and Longjim soils are 14 to 20 inches to a duripan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Marsite soils are on hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff. Elevations are 3,000 to 4,500 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but a significant portion is received following convection storms from July through September. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 66 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 300 days."
