  "OVERVIEW": "The Marsite series consists of shallow, and very shallow somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff. Marsite soils are on hills and mountains. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

Crosgrain, Greyeagle and Longjim soils do not have a duripan underlain by bedrock.

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt, andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff. Elevations are 3,000 to 4,500 feet. The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but a significant portion is received following convection storms from July through September. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 61 to 66 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 300 days."
