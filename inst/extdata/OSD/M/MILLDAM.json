  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in glacial outwash with an influence of loess in the surface.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations are 2600 to 3000 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Skooker soils are on adjacent forested outwash plains and are loamy-skeletal with an ash influence.  Tenwalter soils are on the scabland (intermound) component of patterned ground and are clayey-skeletal and shallow to a duripan.  Tolius soils are on adjacent forested outwash plains and are fine-loamy with an ash influence."
