  "OVERVIEW": "The Metmill series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. They are on alluvial fans and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to the irrigation-induced water table and aquic conditions is 20 to 30 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 30 to 60 inches. The upper 7 to 18 inches has estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 10 to 20 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half extractable iron of 0.3 to 0.5 percent. Base saturation throughout the upper 30 inches is greater than 75 percent. The particle-size control section has 26 to 34 percent clay and averages 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Rock fragments by weighted average range from 35 to 60 percent by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent in the Ap and AB hoizons.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Texture is ashy loam or very gravelly ashy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AB and Bw1 horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.
