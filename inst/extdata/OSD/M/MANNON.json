Carroll, Myrtle, Nasset, Newhouse, Oak Center, Shelbyville, Watkins, Waubeek, and Yutan series. Batavia soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Bowes soils have 60 to 90 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Churchtown soils have 10 to 55 percent sand in the particle-size control section. Deroin soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Downs soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Ella soils have horizons with 15 to 60 percent sand in the series control section. Festina soils have more sand in the lower part of the series control section. Frankville soils have limestone bedrock within 40 inches. Gladek soils have carbonates within 60 inches. Greenbush soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Harvard soils have 30 to 75 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Hersey soils formed in loess and underlying loamy glacial till and have a lithologic discontinuity. Juda soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and underlying moderately fine-textured, calcareous glacial till and have a lithologic discontinuity. Knox soils are less acid in the series control section. Luana soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess and underlying residuum weathered from arenaceous limestone and have a lithologic discontinuity. Massbach soils have a paralithic contact within 60 inches. Mellott soils formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of silty material and underlying glaciofluvium and loamy glacial till and have a lithologic discontinuity. Mt. Carroll soils do not have zones within 152 cm (60 inches) that are frequently saturated for periods longer than one month. Myrtle soils formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loess and late Sangamon reddish paleosols formed in sandy loam to loam or clay loam Illinoian glacial till and have a lithologic discontinuity. Nasset soils have limestone bedrock within 55 inches. Newhouse soils have 5 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Oak Center have a sand content of more than 10 percent in the lower third of the series control section. Shelbyville soils formed in 61 to 122 cm (24 to 48 inches) of loess and underlying residuum from limestone and have a lithologic discontinuity. Watkins soils have 30 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Waubeek soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and underlying glacial till and have a lithologic discontinuity. Yutan soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mannon soils occupy nearly level to sloping ridgetops and side slopes. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. They formed in loess that has been leached of carbonates to depths of 5 feet or more. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.3 to 12.8 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 965 mm (33 to 38 inches)."
