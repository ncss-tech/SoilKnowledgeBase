  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 43 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 0 to 20 percent schist paragravel.  The solum has an estimated volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 0.95 g/cc.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly sandy loam, very flaggy sandy loam, or extremely stony sandy loam.  It has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mountaineer soils are on mountainsides and ridgetops with southerly aspects and have slopes of 30 to 90 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium from schist or gneiss, mixed with volcanic ash.  Many areas have been glaciated but little evidence of till is in the profile.  Elevations are 1,400 to 4,800 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 75 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F.; the mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F.; growing season at 28 degrees F. is about 120 to 150 days."
