Rock fragments of shale or thin bedded limestone range from 0 to 25 percent in the upper part of the solum, from 5 to 35 percent in the lower part of the solum and from 10 to 60 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction in the unlimed soil is very strongly acid and moderately acid in the upper part of the solum, and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry color value is 6 or 7.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  The Bt1 horizon has value and chroma of 4.  The Bt2 and BC horizons have value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2.  Fine-earth textures are silty clay loam, silty clay and clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 2.  Fine-earth texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay."

Millheim soils formed in residuum from dark colored calcareous carbonaceous shale interbedded with some limestone.  Climate is temperate and humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 42 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 48 to 55 degrees F.; and the frost free season ranges from 150 to 170 days."

Berks soils do not have argillic horizons and have bedrock at a depth of between 20 and 40 inches.  Clarksburg and Penlaw soils have fragipans.  Hagerstown soils have mixed minerology.  Hublersburg soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Opequan soils have bedrock at a depth of 10 to 20 inches."
