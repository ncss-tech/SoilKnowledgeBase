  "OVERVIEW": "The Millheim series consists of deep well drained soils.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from dark colored calcareous shale.  They are on convex upland slopes of 0 to 25 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F.",

Rock fragments of shale or thin bedded limestone range from 0 to 25 percent in the upper part of the solum, from 5 to 35 percent in the lower part of the solum and from 10 to 60 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction in the unlimed soil is very strongly acid and moderately acid in the upper part of the solum, and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Dry color value is 6 or 7.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  The Bt1 horizon has value and chroma of 4.  The Bt2 and BC horizons have value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2.  Fine-earth textures are silty clay loam, silty clay and clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 2.  Fine-earth texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay."
