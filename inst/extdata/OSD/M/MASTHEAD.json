  "REVDATE": "06/2011",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Masthead series consists of moderately well drained soils that formed in schist and meta-sedimentary rock from slope alluvium and residuum. Masthead soils are on side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 355 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees Celsius (69 degrees F).",

Bapos soils are greater than 60 inches deep and are on fans and terraces. Benridge soils are greater that 60 inches deep and have mineralogy dominated by amorphous material. Hellman soils are greater than 60 inches deep and become more acid with depth. Honker soils are on sandstone and frost free days less than 260. Kimball soils are very deep or have duripans below 40 inches. Milpitas soils are very deep and are on terraces from alluvium. Newville soils are very deep. Positas soils are deep and have less then 280 frost free days. Tierra soils are deep and are on terraces from alluvium. Wappo soils are very deep in aluuvium and have less than 205 frost free days."
