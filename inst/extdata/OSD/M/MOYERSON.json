  "OVERVIEW": "The Moyerson series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to soft bedrock.  They formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from soft shale and siltstone.  These soils are on upland hills, ridges, and dissected plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0  to 10 inches.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  The weighted average of gypsum content above the bedrock ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Continuous subhorizons of concentrated visible secondary calcium carbonates should not occur within the control section; however, visible accumulations may occur uniformly throughout the control sections.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.  ESP ranges from 0 to 15, and EC ranges from 0 to 14 mmhos/cm in the material above the bedrock.  Coarse fragments in the particle-size control section range from 0 to 35 percent and are predominantly one-half to 10 inches in size.  The control section is uniform with only minor stratification.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F. The Moyerson soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for more than 60 consecutive days between June 10 and September 10 in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. Boulders, flagstones, channers, or stones are in the surface layer of some pedons.\nThe C, and AC horizons if present, have hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  It is clay loam, silty clay, or clay and has 35 to 60 percent clay, 5 to 50 percent silt, and 10 to 60 percent sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

They formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from shale and interbedded siltstone. Slopes are simple and complex and range from 2 to 65 percent. Elevations are 5,600 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 17 inches with about half falling as snow and less commonly as rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 70 to 110 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
