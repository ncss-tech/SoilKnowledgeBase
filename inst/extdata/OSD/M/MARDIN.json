  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 97 through 183 cm (38 through 72 inches). Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 36 through 66 cm (14 through 26 inches). Depth to bedrock ranges from 152 cm (60 inches) through 6 meters (20 feet) or more. There is commonly 55 percent or more silt plus very fine sand in the fine-earth fraction above the fragipan. Rock fragments are dominantly channers, flagstones, or gravel, and range from 5 to 35 percent in the horizons above the fragipan, and commonly from 15 to 60 percent in the Bx and C horizons. Some pedons do not have rock fragments in layers below a depth of 152 cm (60 inches).\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Some pedons in uncultivated areas have a dark A horizon that is 3 to 13 cm (1 to 5 inches) thick. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to B and E horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Structure is very fine through medium subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is very friable through firm. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Structure is subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction commonly ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid but the range includes slightly acid in limed areas. The E, Bw or BE horizons have redoximorphic features in some part above 51 cm (20 in), but are not distinct or prominent within 30 cm (12 in).\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4 with faint to prominent redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. The Bx horizon has weak to strong very coarse prismatic structure. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid. Some pedons have a BC or a CB horizon.\nThe C horizon, or Cd horizon where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Textures are similar to the Bx horizon except silty layers that do not have rock fragments are in some pedons below a depth of 102 cm (40 in). The C horizon is massive, or has weak plate-like divisions. Consistence is firm or very firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the upper part, but can range to slightly alkaline below a depth of 152 cm (60 in) in some pedons. Some pedons lack C horizons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Bath, Braceville, Broadalbin, Ira, Lackawanna, Rushford, Sodus, Swartswood, Wellsboro, and Wurtsboro series are in the same family. Bath soils do not have redoximorphic features in the B or E horizons above 51 cm (20 in) and are slightly deeper to the fragipan. Braceville soils have stratified sand and gravel in the substratum. Broadalbin soils have rock fragments dominated by soft black shale, granite and gneiss. Ira, Swartswood and Wurtsboro soils commonly have less than 55 percent silt plus very fine sand in the particle size control section.  Lackawanna and Wellsboro soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the fragipan. Rushford soils lack rock fragments in the 2Bx and 2C horizons. Sodus soils lack distinct or prominent redoximorphic features above 75 cm (30 in).\nThe Canaseraga, Langford, Marilla, and Mosherville series are similar soils in related families, but these may change as series are reclassified. Canaseraga soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section. Langford and Marilla soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections. Mosherville soils have redoximorphic features within 12 inches of the soil surface and formed in deposits derived from granite and gneiss."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mardin soils are nearly level to very steep with slopes ranging from 0 through 50 percent. These soils developed in till, and are on slightly convex parts of dissected glaciated uplands. Mean annual temperature ranges 6 to 11 degrees C (43 through 52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 795 through 1725 millimeters (31 through 68 inches), and mean annual frost-free season ranges from 105 through 180 days. These soils generally occur at elevations between 100 and 670 meters (328 and 2,198 feet), but have been mapped as high as 750 meters (2,460 feet) in some areas."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Bath soils are well drained and occupy higher, more convex parts of adjacent landscapes. Somewhat poorly drained Volusia soils and poorly drained Chippewa soils are drainage associates, and occur on footslopes, toeslopes, level hill tops, and in depressions. Arnot, Greene, Lordstown, Nassau, and Tuller soils are in nearby areas where depth to bedrock is less than 102 cm (40 in). Valois soils do not have a fragipan and are commonly on nearby lateral and end moraines. Alton, Chenango, Hoosic, Howard, and Otisville soils are on nearby glaciofluvial terraces."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. A seasonal water table typically occurs at depths of 36 to 61 cm (14 to 24 in) below the soil surface. The potential for surface runoff is medium to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the mineral surface layer, subsurface layer, and upper part of the subsoil; and low or moderately low in the lower part of the subsoil (fragipan) and the substratum."

A significant acreage is idle or has reverting to brush and trees. Woodlots contain sugar maple, beech, white ash, black cherry, hemlock, and occasionally red oak and white pine."
