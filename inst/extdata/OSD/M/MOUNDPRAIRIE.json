  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the recent silty alluvial sediments and depth to the buried soil is 20 to 60 inches.  The recent sediments are calcareous in all parts and have a calcium carbonate equivalent of 1 to 10 percent.  The control section has 18 to 35 percent clay, typically 20 to 30, and less than 15 percent of fine sand and coarser particles.\nThe Ap horizon is 10YR 3/1 or 2/1 and lacks mottles in some pedons.  It typically is silt loam or silty clay loam but ranges to loam in a few pedons.  It has slight or strong effervescence.\nThe Cg horizon typically has a hue of 10YR but hue of 2.5Y is in the range.  It has a dominant value of 3 and chroma of 1 but it has strata with value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has few through many mottles.  It typically is silt loam or silty clay loam but the lighter colored strata typically have less clay or more sand or both than the darker colored strata.  It has slight or strong effervescence.\nThe Ab horizon is N 2/0 or N 3/0 or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  It typically is silt loam or silty clay loam, but has loam or clay loam subhorizons in some pedons and in other pedons, where recent sediments are thick, the Ab may be loam or clay loam throughout.  It has slight effervescence in some pedons.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Some pedons have buried B horizons."

Chaska soils have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  Newalbin soils are coarse-silty.  Rawles soils are moderately well drained."

They formed in 20 to 60 inches of calcareous recent silty alluvial sediments.  These sediments overlie a buried soil.  Mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 28 to 34 inches."

Moderately well drained Minneiska soils are coarse-loamy and are on slightly higher parts of flood plains.  Moderately well drained Rawles soils are on slightly higher parts of flood plains and are further from stream channels than Minneiska soils."

Most of the very poorly drained phase is in native vegetation.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous forest on the poorly drained phase and reeds, sedges, cattails, willows, and scattered cottonwoods on the very poorly drained phase."
