  "OVERVIEW": "The McFarland series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in medium textured alluvium from granitic rock sources.  McFarland soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between the depths of about 4 and 12 inches is dry in all parts from mid April until mid January.  It is only continuously moist in some part less than 90 consecutive days during the winter.  Mean annual soil temperature is 63 degrees to 67 degrees F.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 48 inches and commonly is below 40 inches.  Carbonates are usually disseminated but some pedons have few segregated filaments or threads, seams, or soft masses.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is loam or clay loam and in most pedons the entire profile is loam or clay loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay content.  Rock fragments are usually less than 1/2 inch in diameter and they make up less than 10 percent of the profile.  Some pedons show weakly defined thick stratification below 40 inches, but distinct thin stratification is lacking.\nThe A horizon has a dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; or 2.5Y 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2; or 2.5Y 4/2.  Organic matter in the upper 7 inches is less than one percent and decreases regularly with depth.  This horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent and gravel content varies from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe C horizon has a dry color of 10YR 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 7/3; 2.5Y 6/2, or 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 4/2, or 5/2.  The upper part is loam or clay loam and the lower part, below 40 inches, is light loam, loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Clay content varies from 15 to 35 percent.  Gravel content is 5 to 10 percent.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

Leeds soils have a hue of 7.5YR or redder and the organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.  Mogul soils are gravelly or very gravelly and the moisture control section is moist in some part during the summer months of July, August, or September.  Panoche soils are effervescent throughout the profile."

The soils formed in deep medium textured alluvium from granitic rock sources.  The climate is arid (desert) with hot dry summers and cool winter.  Mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches, very little of which occurs in summer.  The average January temperature is about 47 degrees F., average July temperature is about 82 degrees F., mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 250 to 275 days."
