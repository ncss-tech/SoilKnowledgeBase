  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Muncie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and in the underlying till overlying outwash. Muncie soils are on kames, eskers, and outwash floored till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Beasley, Bratton, Caneyville, Donahue, Eden, Enott, Faywood, Fredonia, Haggatt, Heverlo, Milton, and Shrouts soils have paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Bledsoe, Brashear, Elba, and Lowell soils have rock fragments that are dominantly limestone, siltstone, shale, or sandstone. Bonnell soils are more acid than moderately acid in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Bucklick, Estate, and Kewaunee soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in some part of the argillic horizon. Cosperville soils are not clearly differentiated from the Muncie soils because of overlapping properties within the series control section. Muncie soils are greater than 183 cm (6 feet) to a seasonal high water table and Cosperville soils have a seasonal high water table at a depth ranging from 91 to 183 cm (3 and 6 feet). However, redox depletions in Cosperville soils are not always present within the series control section. Heitt and Jessup soils average more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Markland soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Mountpleasant soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Vandalia soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 122 cm (48 inches)."
