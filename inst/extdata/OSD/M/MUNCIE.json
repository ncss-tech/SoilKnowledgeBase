Beasley, Bratton, Caneyville, Donahue, Eden, Enott, Faywood, Fredonia, Haggatt, Heverlo, Milton, and Shrouts soils have paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Bledsoe, Brashear, Elba, and Lowell soils have rock fragments that are dominantly limestone, siltstone, shale, or sandstone. Bonnell soils are more acid than moderately acid in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Bucklick, Estate, and Kewaunee soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in some part of the argillic horizon. Cosperville soils are not clearly differentiated from the Muncie soils because of overlapping properties within the series control section. Muncie soils are greater than 183 cm (6 feet) to a seasonal high water table and Cosperville soils have a seasonal high water table at a depth ranging from 91 to 183 cm (3 and 6 feet). However, redox depletions in Cosperville soils are not always present within the series control section. Heitt and Jessup soils average more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Markland soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Mountpleasant soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Vandalia soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 122 cm (48 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Muncie soils are on shoulders and backslopes on kames, eskers, and dissected outwash floored till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. The soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and in the underlying till overlying outwash. Depth to the underlying sandy outwash is 1.2 to 2.4 meters (4 to 8 feet). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1092 mm (36 to 43 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 12.2 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 274 to 335 meters (900 to 1100 feet) above mean sea level."

It is moderately low or moderately high between the structural units in the 2C horizon. Permeability is moderately slow in the subsoil; moderately slow or slow in the substratum formed in till; and rapid or very rapid in the underlying outwash. Permeability is slow between the structural units in the 2C horizon."
