It is slightly acid or neutral throughout the solum.  Gravel content is between 2 to 10 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizons are 10YR 3/2, 4/2, or 5/2 dry and 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, or 3/2 moist.  Texture is loam or coarse sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizons are 10YR 3/4, 5/3, 5/4, or 5/6 dry and 10YR 2/3 or 3/3 moist.
