  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Longbranch, Menbo, Royst, Snell, and Winterim series.  All of these soils have xeric moisture regime.  In addition, Longbranch soils are deep to lithic contacts, Menbo soils have less than 20 percent stones in the particle-size control section, Royst soils are  moderately deep to thin paralithic contacts, Snell soils are usually moist, and Winterim soils are deep to paralithic contacts."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mendeboure soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from basalt and andesite.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 6,200 to 7,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Karlo, Madeline, and Newlands soils.  The miscellaneous land type Rubble land, is also directly adjacent to Mendeboure soils.  Karlo soils are very-fine and churn on wetting and drying.  Madeline soils are clayey and shallow to lithic contacts.  Newlands soils are fine-loamy, deep to lithic contacts, have mollic epipedons 12 to 16 inches thick, and have a cryic temperature regime."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series was inactivated in 2007 as a result of the update and recorrelation of the Soil Survey of Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area, California and Nevada in 2006.\nThe revision of 1999 moved the type location from the Susanville Area soil survey in part of Lassen County to the Surprise Valley-Home Camp Area soil survey in part of Modoc County and also changed the series status to established.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 25 inches (A, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 3 to 31 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, and Bt4 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 31 inches to underlying hard bedrock (2R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 3 to 23 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons and a part of the Bt3 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
