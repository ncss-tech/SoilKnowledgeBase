  "OVERVIEW": "The Mendeboure series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from basalt and andesite.  Mendeboure soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mendeboure soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed in colluvium derived from basalt and andesite.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 6,200 to 7,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

Karlo soils are very-fine and churn on wetting and drying.  Madeline soils are clayey and shallow to lithic contacts.  Newlands soils are fine-loamy, deep to lithic contacts, have mollic epipedons 12 to 16 inches thick, and have a cryic temperature regime."
