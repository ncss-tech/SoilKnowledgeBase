  "OVERVIEW": "The Mannering series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on drainageways, floodplains, and low terraces. They formed in mixed volcanic ash and alluvium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Slope ranges from 2 to 5 percent. The average annual air temperature is about 6.5 degrees C. The average annual precipitation is about 787 mm.",
