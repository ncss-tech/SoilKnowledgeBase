  "OVERVIEW": "The Mollineaux series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy and loamy deposits on moraines, stream terraces, and lake terraces. Slope ranges from 12 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",

The Fern series has been reclassified as sandy over loamy, mixed, active mesic Arenic Oxyaquic Glossudalfs. Further investigation will be needed to determine the extent of the Mollineaux series in the other counties where the Fern series has been mapped.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
