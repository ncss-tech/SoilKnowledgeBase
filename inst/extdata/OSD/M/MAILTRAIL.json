  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to cemented caliche ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments cover 5 to 75 percent of the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Caliche and limestone fragments range from 35 to 85 percent by volume.  Some pedons contain a few chert fragments.  The fragments are dominantly pebbles and cobbles. Fragments larger than 10 inches comprise less than 35 percent by volume.  The fine-earth fraction is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Total clay ranges from 25 to 40 percent silicate clay ranges from 20 to 35 percent. Soil reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkm1 horizon is a strongly cemented or indurated petrocalcic horizon.\nThe Bkm2 and Bkm3 horizons are extremely weakly to moderately cemented pedtrocalci horizons.  Rock fragments of limestone, caliche, and chert fragments are 2 to 90 percent by volume.  A BCk horizon, where present, is noncemented caliche."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Eola series in the same family, and the Boracho, Cho, Espy, Kavett, Kimbrough, Olmos, Pitzer, Queeny and Upton series in similar families.  Eola soils formed in residuum weathered from Cretaceous marl beds. They are on uplands and have a Cr horizon below the petrocalcic horizon.  Kavett soils are underlain by limestone bedrock within 20 inches.  Cho, Espy, Kimbrough and Pitzer soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Boracho, Espy, Kimbrough, Pitzer and Queeny soils contain less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Olmos soils have mean annual soil temperature higher than 72 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mailtrail soils are on gently sloping to moderately sloping high terraces and fans.  Slopes are convex and gradients are dominantly 2 to 5 percent but range from 1 to 8 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous, gravelly, loamy Pleistocene alluvium derived from areas of Cretaceous limestone, chalk, and marl.  The climate is dry subhumid to semiarid. Average annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 26 inches, and annual P-E index ranges from 25 to about 39.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 69 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 210 to 240.  Elevation ranges from 1500 to 2500 feet."

Rio Diablo soils are in valleys or on broad alluvial plains, are very deep, more clayey, contain less than 15 percent rock fragments, and do not have a calcic horizon.  Eckrant soils are underlain by limestone bedrock within 20 inches, have more than 35 percent rock fragments, and do not have a calcic horizon.  Eckrant, Ector, Eola, Oplin and Real soils are on uplands above the Pleistocene terraces on which Mailtrail soils occur."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  The soils are well drained.  Runoff is very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, low on 3 to 5 percent slopes and medium on 5 to 8 percent slopes.  Permeability is moderate above the petrocalcic, very slow permeability in the petrocalcic and moderately slow below the petrocalcic."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as rangeland and is a source of caliche for roadbed construction.  The native vegetation consists of short and mid grasses, woody plants and forbs.  Live oak, redberry and blueberry juniper, are the dominant woody plants.  Other woody plants are mesquite, agarito, persimmon, and prickly pear. Grasses are red grama, hairy tridens, fall witchgrass, Texas wintergrass, little bluestem, and three-awn.  Important forbs are verbena, dogweed, croton, and orange zexmania."
