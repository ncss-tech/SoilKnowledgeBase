  "OVERVIEW": "The McCooley series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and/or locally derived eolian material from noncalcareous sandstone.  McCooley soils are on summits and shoulders of ridges and backslopes of hillslopes in mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
