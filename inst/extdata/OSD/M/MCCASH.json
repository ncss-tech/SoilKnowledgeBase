  "OVERVIEW": "The McCash series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy and sandy colluvial materials.  These soils are on uplands swales and have slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about l9 inches at the type location.",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  McCash is the only series in the family.  Closely related series in other families are Duroc, Haxtun, Kuma, Eltree and Vetal.  Duroc soils are fine-silty and have calcareous material within a depth of 36 inches. Haxtun soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon. Kuma soils are fine-silty, have an argillic horizon and have calcareous material within the control section.  In addition, Kuma soils have a polygenetic solum.  Eltree soils are fine-silty and occur generally in wetter climates.  Vetal soils are coarse-loamy."

These soils formed in local loamy and sandy colluvial and alluvial materials.  The range of mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches, and the range of mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F."
