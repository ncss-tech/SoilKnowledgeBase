    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry throughout, between 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days during the period of four months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches and the solum is 40 to 60 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  Gravel and cobble content on the surface and in the solum is 0 to 15 percent.  The soil ranges from neutral to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry.  Organic carbon decreases regularly with increasing depth.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, clay, silty clay or clay loam with 35 to 45 percent clay.  Faint mottles are below 40 inches in some pedons.\nThe 2BC horizon is stratified sandy clay loam, clay loam or silty clay loam.  It has 0 to 60 percent rock fragments."

Denbar soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 52 degrees F, are mildly to moderately alkaline and have a duripan at 40 to 60 inches.  Deter soils have mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 53 degrees F.  Jacknife soils have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees F. Mindego soils have 9 to 15 degrees F difference between the mean summer and winter soil temperatures and commonly are cobbly or stony in the lower part of the solum.  Nebeker soils have 7.5YR and 5YR hue in the Bt horizons and have a calcareous C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed in moderately fine and fine textured alluvium from basic igneous and sedimentary rocks.  The soils are at elevations of 1,500 to 4,000 feet.  The soils formed under cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers with a mean annual temperature of 50 to 55 degrees F, mean January temperature of 35 to 38 degrees F, and mean July temperature of 69 to 72 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 45 inches.  The frost-free period is 125 to 235 days."
