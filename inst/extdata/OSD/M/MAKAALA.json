  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Makaala soils are on eastern slopes and uplands of Kilauea and Mauna Loa volcanoes at elevations from 610 to 1219 meters (2,000 to 4,000 feet). These soils are on constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level pahoehoe flows that are 5,000 to 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 3 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 3500 to 5100 millimeters (150 to 200 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 762 to 1016 millimeters (30 to 40 inches).  Precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in all months of normal years.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 16 to 22 degrees C. (61 to 71 degrees F.).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)."
