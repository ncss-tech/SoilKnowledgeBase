They developed in material weathered from andesite or volcanic breccia. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. The average January temperature is about 38 degrees F, the average July temperature is 64 degrees F. The average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. The average growing season (28 degrees F.) is 220 to 240 days. The average annual precipitation is 40 to 75 inches."
