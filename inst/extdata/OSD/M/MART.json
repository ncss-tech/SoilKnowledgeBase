  "OVERVIEW": "The Mart series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from andesite or volcanic breccia on hillsides, ridgetops and mountain slopes, or deeply dissected plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 40 to 75 inches and average annual  temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
