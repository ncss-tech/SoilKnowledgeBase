    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick over bedrock. These soils are moist in some parts of the moisture control section more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but are continually dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days during the summer months in more than 7 out of 10 years.  The mean annual soil temperature  at depth of 20 inches is 43 to 45 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 to 61 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak thin or medium platy to weak fine granular structure.  This horizon is soft or slightly hard, friable or very friable,nonsticky or slightly sticky, and nonplastic or slightly plastic.  it is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Value darker than 3.5 moist, 5.5 dry with chroma of 3 or less extends to a depth of 12 to 18 inches.  The B2 horizon is coarse sandy loam to light loam with 70 to 60 percent cobbles in individual subhorizons and averaging 40 percent in the entire B horizon. It is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular or angular blocky structure. This horizon is hard or very hard, and friable or firm. It is slightly acid or neutral."

Mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 61 to 62 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is  16 to 20 inches, distributed fairly uniformly throughout the year except June which is drier.
