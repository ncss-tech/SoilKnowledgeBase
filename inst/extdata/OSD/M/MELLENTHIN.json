  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone or limestone and in part from an eolian mantle. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F. (10 to 13.3 degrees C.).  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 14 inches (203 to 356 mm). The freeze-free period is 130 to 165 days."

In Utah this series is correlated with semidesert range sites.\nRevised for the correlation of Canyonlands National Park (UT688), October 2009,\nWWJ.\nUpdated competing series section and adjusted soil temperature to better separate series in MLRA 34 form MLRA 35. Soils in southern Utah have slightly cooler soil temperatures.
