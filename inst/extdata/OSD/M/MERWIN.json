  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the organic soil material and the depth to the mineral soil substratum range from 16 to 51 inches.   The content of woody fragments ranges from 0 to 25 percent, but the higher contents are only in the upper part of the control section.  The fiber is dominantly of herbaceous origin except for some pedons that have fiber of sphagnum moss dominant in part to all of the surface tier.   Reaction (in 0.01 M calcium chloride) typically is less than 4.5 in all parts of the organic soil material; however, in some pedons part to all of the organic soil material in the bottom tier has reaction of slightly more than 4.5.\nThe surface tier consists of either fibric, hemic, or sapric material or any combination of two or more of these materials.  However, hemic material is dominant in the organic soil portion of the control section in pedons that have a mineral substratum beginning above a depth of 35 inches.\nThe subsurface tier is dominantly hemic material, and sapric material totals less than 10 inches in thickness in the subsurface and bottom tier in pedons that have the mineral substratum below a depth of 35 inches.  A layer of sapric material commonly is immediately above the mineral substratum.  Fibric material is not present in the subsurface or bottom tiers.\nThe hemic material has on the broken face hue of 5YR through 10YR with value and chroma of 2 through 4.  Color of material with the higher value and chroma commonly darkens about one unit in value or chroma or both after exposure to the air.  Color upon rubbing commonly is up to one unit lower in value or chroma or both than the broken face.  The hemic material has 6 to 15 percent of mineral material.\nThe mineral substratum ranges from 5YR to 5Y hue, with the redder hues commonly becoming dominant with depth.  It has value of 2 through 5 and chroma of 0 to 4.  It typically is glacial till and commonly is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam, but the full range includes other kinds of glacial sediments and all other texture classes within the limits of the loamy particle-size class.  The upper few inches of the mineral substratum is sandy in some pedons.  The mineral substratum ranges from extremely acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Merwin soils are in bogs primarily in rather shallow depressions chiefly on ground moraines, but they also are in bogs in lacustrine and outwash plains.  They generally have slope gradients of less than 5 feet per mile.  They formed in 16 to 51 inches of organic soil material that is derived primarily from herbaceous plants over loamy, noncalcareous glacial sediments of Late Wisconsin Age.  These sediments primarily are glacial till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 32 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The main ones are the very poorly drained Greenwood soils which are in parts of bogs where the organic soil material is thicker.  Associated mineral soils primarily include soils formed in reddish, noncalcareous, loamy glacial till."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Very poorly drained; surface runoff is very low or ponded.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is rapid in the upper part and slow and moderately slow in the underlying material. Merwin soils have an apparent seasonal high saturation at thre surface for some time from October to June in normal years."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Almost all of this soil is in native vegetation.  Native vegetation consists primarily of sedges and grasses, but sphagnum mosses are common in some areas.  An overstory of scattered black spruce, tamarack, or alder also is in some areas."
