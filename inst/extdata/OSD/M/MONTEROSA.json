  "OVERVIEW": "The Monterosa series consists of very shallow and shallow to a hardpan, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in very gravelly sediments.  These soils are on remnants of alluvial fans and fan-piedmonts and have slopes ranging from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 62 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.",

The soils formed in very gravelly sediments derived from such rocks as rhyolite and andesite.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees F. to 66 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 8 to 13 inches with a marked summer maximum."
