The soil surface is about 95 percent covered with a desert pavement of rhyolite gravel, mainly less than 1 inch in diameter with a few up to 2 inches in diameter.  A very few gravel have thin, discontinuous carbonate coatings.  Some of the gravel is partially to completely coated with black desert varnish.\nAk--0 to 2 inches; dominantly pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2) very gravelly sandy loam, brown (7.5YR 4/2) moist with smaller amount light brown (7.5YR 6/4); weak thin platy structure; soft; few coarse roots; some thin (less than 1mm) reddish brown layers between plates in upper part; gravel tops are usually carbonate-free, and some are stained reddish brown; gravel bottoms have thin, discontinuous carbonate coatings; effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary. (1 to 3 inches thick)\nBk1--2 to 7 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; weak fine crumb and weak medium and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard; common fine and very fine roots; carbonate coatings on gravel, thickest on undersides; coatings are thicker in the lower part of the horizon; some gravel tops in the upper part of the horizon are carbonate-free and a few are stained reddish brown; a few carbonate filaments; effervescent; moderately alkaline; clear smooth boundary. (4 to 10 inches thick)\nBk2--7 to 12 inches; brown (7.5YR 5/4) very gravelly sandy clay loam, brown (7.5YR 4/4) moist; a soft mass of weak fine crumbs; common fine roots; common extremely hard carbonate-cemented fragments mainly 1/2 to 2 inches in diameter which are lighter than very pale brown (10YR 8/2); effervescent; moderately alkaline; abrupt smooth boundary.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on remnants of alluvial fans and fan-piedmonts of late or mid-Pleistocene age.  Elevations range from 4,300 to 5,600 feet.  Ridges are common.  Longitudinal slopes along ridge crests range from about 3 to 10 percent.  Slopes of ridge sides range from 3 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in very gravelly sediments derived from such rocks as rhyolite and andesite.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 degrees F. to 66 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 8 to 13 inches with a marked summer maximum."

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
