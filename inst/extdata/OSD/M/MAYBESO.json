  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maybeso soils occur on broad ridgetops, hillslopes, gentle to steep benches, backslopes and summits of mountains, and footslopes and toeslopes of valleys.  The substratum is glacial till of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is humid maritime with a mean annual precipitation of about 100 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F, and the mean summer air temperature is about 55 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 42 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The slope gradient commonly is less than 35 percent, but the range is 5 to 60 percent.  Elevation ranges from sea level to 1100 feet."

The Karta, Tolstoi, and Ulloa series are well drained mineral soils.  Kina and Kogish soils are very deep, less decomposed organic soils occupying depressional areas associated with drumlinoid hills; and the toeslopes, footslopes, and floors of valleys.  McGilvery soils are shallow to bedrock and formed from forest litter on hillslopes and valleysides.  St. Nicholas and Wadleigh soils are poorly drained mineral soils.  Hydaburg soils are shallow to bedrock organic soils that occur in alpine areas."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Maybeso soils are used for watershed protection, wildlife habitat, recreation, and timber production. The overstory vegetation is dominantly western redcedar, mountain hemlock, and Alaska-cedar, with lesser amounts of western hemlock and Sitka spruce in the Ketchikan area of Southeast Alaska. Western redcedar is replaced by western hemlock as the dominant overstory species North of Petersburg, Alaska.  The understory vegetation is dominantly blueberry and red huckleberry, with lesser amounts of skunk cabbage and marsh marigold."
