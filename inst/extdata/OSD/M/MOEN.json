  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches; thickness of solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The average annual sil temperature at the type location is 46 degrees F.  The average summer soil temperature is slightly more the 60 degrees F.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 to 4.5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B2t horizon typically has subangular blocky structure, but some pedons have weak prismatic and angular blocky structure."

Adiv, Daniels, Dooley, Empedrado, Fairfield, Farnuf, Livona, Martinsdale, Trag, Tschicoma, Vida, Wemple, Williams, and Yegan soils lack bedrock above a depth of 40 inches.  Lefor, Reeder, and Roundley soils are calcareous and have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Watrous soils are calcareous in the B3 horizon and have moderate or strong prismatic structure in the B2t horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in moderately fine textured, noncalcareous parent materials weathered mainly from granite or materials locally transported.  At the type location the average annual precipitation ragnes from 15 to 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer."
