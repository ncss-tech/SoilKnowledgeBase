  "OVERVIEW": "The Mammoth series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountain slopes and mountain ridges.  These soils formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks.  Slopes are 9 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 24 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F.",
