  "OVERVIEW": "The Minster series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in clayey lacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains and in depressions on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches).",

The Montgomery series has been reclassified to the Vertic subgroup to characterize soils in other MLRA's.
