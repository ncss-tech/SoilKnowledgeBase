In drained areas, depth to an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the soil surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the soil surface between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff ranges from negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low. Permeability is slow."

    "content": "REMARKS: Soils in this series were previously correlated as Montgomery series in MLRA 111B. The Montgomery series has been reclassified to the Vertic subgroup to characterize soils in other MLRA's. Till substratum and gravelly substratum phases are presently recognized and may become new series when these map units phases are updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 31 cm (12 inches) (Ap horizons).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 31 to 204 cm (12 to 80 inches) (Bg, BCg horizons).\nAquic conditions: redoximorphic features directly below the mollic epipedon and in all underlying horizons.\nThe following DMU Descriptions (Rec ID's) have been stored in NASIS for examples of component data for this series: FOH_SSO Minster sicl, 0-1% (576821); FOH_SSO Minster sicl, till sbstm, 0-1% (576822); FOH_SSO Minster sicl, grav sbstm, 0-1% (558182).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data available from The Ohio State University: AG-S2, HD-01, LG-31, MC-21, MC-24, and pending data from the National Soil Survey Laboratory (NSSL) S2010OH037001 (type location) and S2010OH065001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
