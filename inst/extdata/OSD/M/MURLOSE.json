  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Murlose soils are on lava plateaus. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in eolian volcanic ash and residuum derived from basalt. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,555 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
