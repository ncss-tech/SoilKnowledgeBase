  "OVERVIEW": "The Murlose series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and residuum derived from basalt. Murlose soils are on plateaus. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
