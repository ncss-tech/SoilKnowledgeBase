Doger, Dunday and Heber soils do not contain gravel and Heber soils are typically calcareous throughout.  Dorrance soils have lime at 0 to 10 inches.  Pivot soils are moderately deep to coarse sand or gravelly coarse sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The slope gradients range from 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 28 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F."

Brocksburg and Jansen soils have a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section and are above the Meadin soils.  O'Neill soils have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section and are below areas of Meadin soils.  Paka soils have an argillic horizon, thicker solum, are developed over siltstone, and are below areas of Meadin soils.  Simeon soils are sandy throughout and do not have a mollic epipedon and are above Meadin soils."

Consideration should be given to reclassifying the soil to Typic Haplustolls.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory pedons - S69NE089-002; S69NE095-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
