  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  May Day soils are on mountain slopes, alluvial fans, outwash plains, terraces and ridges at elevations of 1,950 to 2,280 meters.  Slopes are from 2 to 30 percent.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary and intermediate igneous rocks.  The climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual air temperature is about 4 to 7 degrees C., and the mean annual summer air temperature is about 16.0 to 18.5 degrees C.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 to 400 mm, distributed fairly uniform throughout the year except for June which is drier.  The frost-free period is about 70 to 100 days."

These soils are correlated to upland ecological sites in Utah."
