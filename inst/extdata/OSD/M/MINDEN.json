  "OVERVIEW": "The Minden series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on interfluves and loess covered stream terraces on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.",
