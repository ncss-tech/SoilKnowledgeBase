Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,800 feet. The climate is low latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches, the mean annual temperature is 69 to 75 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 300 to 360 days."
