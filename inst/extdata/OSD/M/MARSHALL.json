  "OVERVIEW": "The Marshall series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess.  These soils are on interfluves and hill slopes on uplands and on risers and treads on stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 765 millimeters.",
