Blackmagic soils have an accumulation of gypsum within 40 inches of the surface. Brenda soils have gravelly coarse sand in the lower part of the profile below the argillic horizon. Cornville soils have greater than 50 percent sand in the control section.  Dona Ana and Tres Hermanos soils have calcic horizons at depths less than 20 inches.  Elizario soils have more than 50 percent sand in the series control section and are in the Chihuahuan Desert (MLRA 42) and have a summer maximum precipitation pattern. Hap and Tres Hermanos soils average more than 15 percent gravel in the argillic horizon. Madurez soils have argillic horizons less than 10 inches thick and sola less than 25 inches thick. McNew soils have 18 to 27 percent clay.
