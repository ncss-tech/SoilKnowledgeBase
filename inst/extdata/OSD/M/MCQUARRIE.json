  "OVERVIEW": "The McQuarrie series consist of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from basic igneous rock. The McQuarrie soils are on hills and ridges. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
