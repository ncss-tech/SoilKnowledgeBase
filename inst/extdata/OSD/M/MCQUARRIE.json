McQuarrie soils formed in residuum derived from basic igneous rock.  The climate is dry subhumid. Mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, the average annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, and the frost-free period is 100 to 110 days."

Gleason soils are more than 100 cm deep to bedrock and are influenced by pyroclastic materials.  Kessler, Hiko Peak, and Firmage soils are more than 100 cm deep to bedrock, have calcic horizons, and lack argillic horizons. Hiko Peak soils are gravelly and very gravelly. Lorella soils are clayey-skeletal.  Oakden soils are less than 50 cm deep over an indurated lime-cemented hardpan and lack argillic horizons."
