  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  In dry seasons the soil has cracks 2 to 6 cm wide to depths of 50 to 80 cm.  COLE is 0.07 to 0.10 in the upper 30 inches of the soil.  Silicate clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from 35 to 55 percent.  The soil is moderately alkaline and calcareous.  The weighted average calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 25 to 40 percent in the control section.\nThe A horizon is very dark brown (7.5YR 2/2), dark brown (7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/3), and brown (7.5YR 4/2, 5/2; 10YR 4/3, 5/3).  The texture ranges from clay loam to silty clay.\nThe B21ca and B22ca horizons are dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4, 3/3), reddish brown (5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/3, 4/3), and yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 4/6).  The texture ranges from clay loam to silty clay and contains few to common fragments and pebbles of limestone.\nThe B23ca horizon is brown (7.5YR 5/4, 4/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), and reddish brown (5YR 5/4, 4/4).  Texture ranges from gravelly silty clay loam to silty clay.  The B23ca horizon contains 5 to 25 percent fragments of limestone or concretions of calcium carbonate, 2 mm to 2 inches in diameter.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 50 to 80 percent.\nThe R layer is platy to massive limestone that is fractured in the upper part and massive below.  The upper 1 to 3 feet can be ripped."

The soil formed in calcareous clayey sediments over limestone of Lower Cretaceous Age.  Climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 35 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 68 degrees F. and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 46 to 56."
