Reaction ranges form moderately acid to very strongly acid in the A and BA and strongly acid to extremely acid in the Bt, 2Bt and 2BC horizons. Coarse fragments of range from 0 to 35 percent in the A and BA horizons; 0 to 15 percent by volume in the Bt horizon and 15 to 60 percent by volume in the 2Bt and 2BC horizons. Depth to the lithologic discontinuity ranges from 30 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value 4, and chroma 2 through 4, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4. Some pedons have the thin A1 horizons with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 3. Texture is silt loam, loam, gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, chroma of 4 through 8, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6 or 8; or hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8. Iron accumulations and depletions range from none to common in shades of brown or red. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mena soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping uplands in broad valleys of the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma. They formed in pedisediments and old alluvium over shale bedrock or interbedded shale and sandstone bedrock. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. Average annual precipitation ranges from about 46 to 56 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees."

Ceda soils are on floodplains, have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and no argillic horizon. Kenn soils are on\nfloodplains and low terraces, have a fine-loamy particle size control section and a 40 to 60 inch solum. Littlefir soils formed in residuum of shale or interbedded shale and sandstone, have a 20 to 50 inch solum, and are on adjacent uplands. Nashoba are on adjacent uplands, have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section and 20 to 40 inch solum. Sallisaw soils occur on similar landscapes, have fine-loamy particle size control sections and higher base saturation. Sherless soils occur on adjacent uplands, have a fine-loamy particle size control section and a 20 to 40 inch solum. Speer soils occur on floodplains and low terraces, have a fine-loamy particle size control section and higher base saturation.
