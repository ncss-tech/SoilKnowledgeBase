  "OVERVIEW": "The Mellott series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying glaciofluvium and loamy till. Mellott soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mellott soils are on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying glaciofluvium and loamy till. The till is friable and contains strata of coarser textures in many places. In places, sandy and or gravelly layers more than 91 cm (36 inches) thick are at depths of 2.4 to 3.6 meters (8 to 12 feet). In most areas, this soil is on the lower lying portions of the till plains adjacent to terraces and floodplains. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 965 mm (35 to 38 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F)."
