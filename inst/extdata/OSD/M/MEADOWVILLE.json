  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Meadowville series are very deep and moderately well to well drained. Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid. They formed on uplands in local alluvium and underlying residuum weathered from basic and acidic rocks. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches and mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",

Allenwood and Chilmark soils have rock fragments subrounded by glacial action.  Arendtsville, Aura, Birdsboro, Chetwynd, Eubanks, Shouns and Thurmont soils have all or a part of the B horizon 2.5YR or redder.  Bedington, Bucks, Butano, Frankstown, Gilpin, Leck Kill, Nixon, Rayne, Shelocta, Ungers, and Whiteford soils are dominated with shale rock fragments.  Chester soils have mica in the lower B horizon.  Collington and Freehold soils contain glauconite.  Edgemont, Edneytown, Glenelg, Quakertown and Syenite soils have sola less than 40 inches thick and do not have a lithologic discontinuity in the series control section.  Elsinboro soils have sola less than 40 inches thick and water worn pebbles in the particle size control section.  Murrill soils are dominated with limestone rock fragments.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Meadowville soils are on undulating to rolling uplands of the northern Piedmont Plateau and possibly the Blue Ridge.  They are around the heads of drainageways, in saddles or depressions on concave or slightly convex slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in material washed down from associated soils on higher adjacent slopes.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The mean\nannual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches."
