  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 80 inches or more.  Reaction is very strongly acid to medium acid, except for the surface layer in areas that have been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 3, or 4, and chroma of 0; or it is mottled in shades of brown and gray.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, with mottles in shades of brown.  In some pedons the lower part of the Btg horizon is mottled in shades of gray, yellow, or brown.  Soft shale fragments commonly make up about 10 percent of the volume.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The upper 20 inches of the Btg horizon has 35 to 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand.\nThe BC horizon and C horizon, where present, have the same color and texture range as the Btg horizon, or they are mottled in shades of gray, yellow, and brown.  Soft shale fragments commonly make up as much as 10 percent or more of the volume; soft weathered shale bedrock is below a depth of 60 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Balwin, Panola, Sessum, and Wilson series of the same family and the closely related Adaton, Dowellton, Eutaw, Kipling, Midland, Oktibbeha, Tensas, Vaiden, and Wilcox series.  Baldwin and Midland soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the Bt horizon and do not have shale fragments in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Panola and Sessum soils are underlain by calcareous clay.  Wilson soils are in a drier climate with less than 45 inches of average annual precipitation.  Adaton soils have a fine-silty particle size class and do not have high shrink-swell properties.  Midland soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the Bt horizon and do not have shale fragments.  Dowellton soils have a very-fine particle size class and are underlain by hard limestone.  Eutaw and Vaiden soils have a very-fine particle size class, and they have intersecting slickensides within a depth of 40 inches.  Kipling soils have a Bt horizon with chroma of 4 to 8 in the upper part are underlain by marly clay or chalk.  Oktibbeha soils are yellowish red in the upper part of the Bt horizon and have a very-fine particle size class.  Tensas soils have a browner Bt horizon, do not have high shrink-swell properties, and have a 20 percent decrease in clay within 40 inches of the soil surface.  Wilcox soils are mottled red and gray in the upper part of the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mayhew soils formed in acid clayey sediments that are underlain by weathered soft clay shale.  These are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 48 inches near the type location."

Poorly drained Eutaw soils are on broad, level slopes in uplands.  Moderately well drained Oktibbeha and somewhat poorly drained Kipling, Vaiden, and Wilcox soils are in similar positions as the Mayhew soils.  Somewhat poorly drained Bude soils, which have a fragipan, are in similar positions as the Mayhew soils.  Moderately well drained Providence and Savannah soils, which have a fragipan, are mainly on slightly higher ridges."
