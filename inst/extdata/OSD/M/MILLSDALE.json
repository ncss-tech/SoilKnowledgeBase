    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Millsdale soils are on till plains, lake plains, and low terraces of late Wisconsin age. In some areas, they are on monadnocks on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Millsdale soils formed in till overlying limestone or dolostone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 213 to 305 meters (700 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderately slow."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In the past, Millsdale soils have ranged to include soils that are outside the current concept represented by the type location description. In Illinois, soils lacking argillic horizons have been included in the series; in Indiana, the series has ranged to include soils that are in the fine-loamy particle-size family.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, A horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 89 cm (Btg horizon).\nLithic contact: at 89 cm (top of the 2R layer).\nAquic conditions: redox features visible in lower part of the mollic epipedon and throughout the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for HK-40, the previous typical pedon.\nRepresentative data mapunit is DMU ID 130016 in MO 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
