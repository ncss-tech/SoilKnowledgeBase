  "OVERVIEW": "The Millsdale series consists of moderately deep, very poorly drained soils formed in till overlying limestone or dolostone. They are on till plains, lake plains, and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In the past, Millsdale soils have ranged to include soils that are outside the current concept represented by the type location description. In Illinois, soils lacking argillic horizons have been included in the series; in Indiana, the series has ranged to include soils that are in the fine-loamy particle-size family.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, A horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 89 cm (Btg horizon).\nLithic contact: at 89 cm (top of the 2R layer).\nAquic conditions: redox features visible in lower part of the mollic epipedon and throughout the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for HK-40, the previous typical pedon.\nRepresentative data mapunit is DMU ID 130016 in MO 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
