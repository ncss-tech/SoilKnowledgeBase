  "OVERVIEW": "The Montmorenci series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loam till. Montmorenci soils are on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
