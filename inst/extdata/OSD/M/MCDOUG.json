These soils are moderately acid or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A and AB horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.\nThe Bw and BC horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.

Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 31 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."
