  "OVERVIEW": "The McDoug series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains and low terraces at elevations of 800 to 1,600 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
