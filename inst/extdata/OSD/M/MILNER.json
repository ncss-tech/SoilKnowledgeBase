  "OVERVIEW": "The Milner series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from calcareous and gypsiferous sediments. Milner soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
