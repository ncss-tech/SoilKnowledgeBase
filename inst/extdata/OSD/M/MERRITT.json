  "OVERVIEW": "The Merritt series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Merritt soils are on recent alluvial fans and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is between 60 degrees and 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature does not go as low as 41 degrees F.  The control section between depths of 10 and 40 inches has 18 to 30 percent clay and averages less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand.  Pebble-size fragments make up less than 5 percent of the soil.  The soils between depths of 4 and 12 inches are dry from mid June until early November and are moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The soils are calcareous in some or all parts between depths of 10 and 40 inches and may be calcareous above depths of 10 inches and below a depth of 40 inches.  Some pedons are saline or saline-sodic.\nThe A horizon has colors of 10YR 5/2, 5/1, 4/1; 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 5/2 or 5/1.   Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/1, 2/1; 2.5Y 3/2, 2/2; 5Y 3/2, 3/1 or 3/1.   This horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  It contains 1 to 4 percent organic matter which decreases irregularly with depth.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has colors of 10YR 6/2, 5/2, 2.5Y 6/2 or 5/2.   Moist colors are 10YR 5/2, 4/3, 4/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2; 5Y 5/2 or 4/2.  It has distinct or prominent mottles in 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y hues.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon is effervescent with disseminated and segregated lime.\nThe C or C' horizon has colors of 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/2; 2.5Y 6/4; 5Y 6/2 or 6/1.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 4/3, 3/3; 2.5Y 4/3, 4/2; or 5Y 5/2.  It has distinct or prominent mottles.  It is stratified but the most common texture is very fine sandy loam.  It is mainly moderately alkaline but some pedons are strongly alkaline with pH ranges of 8.8 to 9.0.\nAb horizons may be present in some pedons below the C horizon and have the same colors, texture and reaction as the A horizon.\nWhere present, the Cg horizon, below 40 inches, has colors of 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 5/2; N5/0; 5Y 6/2; 5GY 6/1, 5/1; or 5G 5/1.  Moist colors are 2.5Y 4/2; 5Y 4/2; N4/0, 5GY 4/1; or 5G 4/1.  It has distinct or prominent mottles.  It is stratified ranging from loamy fine sand to clay.  These horizons are moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline."
