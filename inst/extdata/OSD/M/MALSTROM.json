  "OVERVIEW": "The Malstrom series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in medium textured eolian and alluvial sediments.  These soils are nearly level very gently sloping uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
