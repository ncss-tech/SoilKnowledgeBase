  "OVERVIEW": "The Makaalae series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash overlying `a`a lava.  Makaalae soils are on uplands and have slopes of 7 to 40 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 75 inches and mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
