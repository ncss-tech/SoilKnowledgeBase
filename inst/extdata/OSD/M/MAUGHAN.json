Cobbles and gravel average 5 to 15 percent in the A horizon and 10 to 35 percent in the E and B horizons.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature at 20 inches is 60 to 63 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 2 or 3 dry, chroma of 1 or 1.5 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam.  It is medium acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is clay, clay loam, cobbly clay and cobbly silty clay, or cobbly clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.  It is medium acid to slightly acid."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There presently are no competing series in the family.  Similar soils are the Elzinga, Flygare, LaPlatta, Lucky Star, Scave, and Smarts series.  Elzinga soils have albic horizons that tongue into very cobbly clay loam argillic horizons having more than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Flygare soils have cryic temperature regimes.  LaPlatta soils lack albic horizons and have horizons of carbonate accumulation.  Lucky Star and Scave soils have mollic epipedons less than l6 inches thick and cryic temperature regimes.  Smarts soils have mollic epipedons with chroma of 2 or more and lack albic horizons."

The soils formed in colluvium from interbedded sandstone and limestone.  The climate is moist subhumid, with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches, mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 60 to 65 degrees.  The freeze-free period is 80 to l20 days."
