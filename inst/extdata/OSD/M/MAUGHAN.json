  "OVERVIEW": "The Maughan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed colluvium from sandstone and limestone on mountainsides, mesas and plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature at 20 inches is 60 to 63 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 2 or 3 dry, chroma of 1 or 1.5 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam.  It is medium acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 to 6.

Elzinga soils have albic horizons that tongue into very cobbly clay loam argillic horizons having more than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Flygare soils have cryic temperature regimes.  LaPlatta soils lack albic horizons and have horizons of carbonate accumulation.  Lucky Star and Scave soils have mollic epipedons less than l6 inches thick and cryic temperature regimes.  Smarts soils have mollic epipedons with chroma of 2 or more and lack albic horizons."
