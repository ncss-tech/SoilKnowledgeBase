  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact of igneous bedrock.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 57 degrees F.; average January soil temperature is 34 to 38 degrees F; average July soil temperature is 64 to 79 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from March 10 to December 10 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from April 15 to November 20.  The soil is dry between the 7 and 18 inch depths from mid-July until mid-October and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The soil has 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and includes stones, cobbles and pebbles.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent in the surface 2 to 5 inches, but is less than 1 percent below a depth of 5 inches.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral and the base saturation ranges from 80 to 95 percent.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown, dark brown, dark yellowish brown, grayish brown, brown, or yellowish brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4).  Moist colors are very dark brown, very dark grayish brown or dark brown (10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2).  It is sandy loam or loam and averages between 12 and 25 percent clay and is stony in most pedons.\nThe B2t horizon is dark brown, dark yellowish brown, brown, or yellowish brown (10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4).  Moist colors are very dark grayish brown to dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4).  It is massive in place, but has weak prismatic or subangular blocky structure when displaced.  It is heavy loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay.  The clay increase is at least 3 percent absolute or 1.2 times more clay in the B2t horizon than in the A horizon.\nThe B3t horizon has the same hue and value as the B2t horizon but commonly is a chroma higher.  The clay content ranges from 20 to 30 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bancas, Blakeport, Bull Trail, Hilt, Morical and Steinbeck series in the same family and the Duzel and Facey series in other families.  Bancas soils lack a lithic contact, have soil temperatures above 47 degrees F. by mid-February, and are dry about 180 days.  Blakeport soils are medium acid or strongly acid and lack a lithic contact.  Bull Trail and Steinbeck soils lack a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Also, Bull Trail soils have a soil temperature above 47 degrees F. by mid-February, and Steinbeck soils have a thick A2 horizon.  Duzel soils have a mollic epipedon.  Facey soils have a mollic epipedon and lack a lithic or paralithic contact at a depth of 40 inches.  Hilt soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches and hard bedrock at depths below 40 inches.  Morical soils have 20 to 40 percent ash and pumice."

The amount of cobbles and/or stones on the soil surface is 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 2,500 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm to hot dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 11 to 18 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 8 to 36 inches.  Mean January temperature is 30 to 36 degrees F.;\nmean July temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 46 to 51 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."

The Jenny, Lassen and Montague soils have clay texture and cracks that extend to the surface when dry.  The Kuck and Terwilliger soils have a fine argillic horizon.  Also, Kuck soils have a mollic epipedon and Terwilliger soils have a paralithic contact.  Louie and Salisbury soils have a strongly cemented duripan at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The color of the A horizon qualifies as a mollic epipedon.  However, on the basis of the Hilt and Stoner soil laboratory data, California SSIR No. 24, it is assumed the organic matter is concentrated in the upper 5 inches of the epipedon and is less than 1 percent below 5 inches.  Therefore, this soil has an ochric epipedon because it is too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.  Last revised by state on 10/78.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
