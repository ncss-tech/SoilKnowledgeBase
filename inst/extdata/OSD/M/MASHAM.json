  "OVERVIEW": "The Masham series consists of shallow, well drained soils on crests and side slopes of hillslopes on low hills, in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). These very slowly permeable soils formed in material weathered from red shales of Permian age. Slope ranges from 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 860 mm (34 in).",
