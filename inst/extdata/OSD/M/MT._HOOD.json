  "OVERVIEW": "The Mt. Hood series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in moderately coarse textured glacial till weathered mostly from porphyritic andesite and basalt rocks. Mt. Hood soils are on hillsides in glaciated valleys in mountainous areas and have slopes of 5 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 105 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F. with an O horizon and full shade. The soils have a udic moisture regime but have a short dry period of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. The solum ranges from 12 to 30 inches thick. The 10- to 40-inch control section is fine sandy loam or sandy loam and has less than 10 percent clay and averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments, dominantly cobblestones.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or less. It is fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam. Stones cover up to 0.1 percent of the surface. Rock fragments range from 5 to 40 percent by volume. This horizon is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe B2ir horizon has dominant hue of 7.5YR but variegated with 10YR and 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry. Rock fragments range from 30 to 60 percent and are dominantly cobblestones. This horizon is medium or strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has loose to hard and friable or firm consistence. It has 50 to 80 percent rock fragments, dominantly cobblestones. This horizon is medium or slightly acid."

Dinzer soils have intermittent A2 horizons less than 1/2 inch thick and lack the variegated colors in hue of 5YR. Lastance soils have firm and very firm consistence and hue of 5YR or 2.5YR throughout the upper part of the spodic horizon."
