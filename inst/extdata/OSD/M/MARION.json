  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 30 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control averages less than 10 percent sand.  An abrupt textural change is at depths of 5 to 18 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. Surface horizons when mixed to a depth of 6 inches have value of 4 or higher.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is extremely acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. The upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon commonly has dominant chroma of more than 2 in both the matrix and on faces of peds, but may be 2 when lacking accumulations of iron. The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 and dominant chroma of 2 or less. It is silty clay or silty clay loam.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages between 45 and 60 percent clay and less than 10 percent sand. Reaction commonly is extremely acid to strongly acid, but it is moderately acid in the lower part of some pedons.\nThe 2BCg or 2Cg horizon, where present below depths of 40 inches, has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."
