  "OVERVIEW": "The Marion series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on uplands and terraces. These soils formed in loess or loess and pedisediment. Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches.",

The upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon commonly has dominant chroma of more than 2 in both the matrix and on faces of peds, but may be 2 when lacking accumulations of iron. The Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6 and dominant chroma of 2 or less. It is silty clay or silty clay loam.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages between 45 and 60 percent clay and less than 10 percent sand. Reaction commonly is extremely acid to strongly acid, but it is moderately acid in the lower part of some pedons.\nThe 2BCg or 2Cg horizon, where present below depths of 40 inches, has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.
