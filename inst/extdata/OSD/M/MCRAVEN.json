  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to the buried soil ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  The 10- to 40- inch control section has 6 to 18 percent clay.  The buried soil has a well defined polygonal pattern formed by coarse prisms that are separated by gray seams.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt or silt loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4, and mottles, if present are in shades of brown and gray, or the horizon is mottled in these colors.  It is silt loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, with mottles in shades of brown or gray.  It is silt loam.  It is medium acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bgcxb horizon has coarse prismatic structure throughout.  The interior of the prisms either is mottled in shades of brown and gray, or there is a matrix with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, with mottles in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Coatings on faces of prisms and the seams between the prisms are gray silt, or silt loam or pockets of very fine sand.  This horizon is slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Convent is the only series in the same family.  Closely related soils in other families are the Belden, Commerce, Falaya, Gillsburg, and Riedtown series.  Convent soils have bedding planes or thin strata within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Belden and Commerce soils have a fine-silty particle-size class.  Falaya and Gillsburg soils have an acid reaction class. Riedtown soils are better drained and do not have a horizon with a matrix with chroma of 2 or less within 20 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The McRaven soils are on flood plains or low terraces along streams that drain areas of the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Area.  The soil formed in silty alluvial sediments that overlie a buried silty soil with strong coarse prismatic structure.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and the annual precipitation is about 57 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Belden, Gillsburg, and Riedtown series, and the Adler series.  These soils are across the nearly linear surfaces of floodplains.  The somewhat poorly drained Belden and Gillsburg soils are in similar positions as the McRaven soils.  The moderately well drained Riedtown soils are in slightly higher areas.  The well drained Adler soils, which have bedding plains, are on natural levees and in areas bordering channels."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderate permeability.  These soils are subject to occasional or frequent flooding for brief durations.  The seasonal water table is at a depth of 1 to 1.5 feet during seasons of high rainfall in winter and spring."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of the soil are used for growing soybeans, cotton, corn, pasture, and hay.  Small areas are used for growing bottom land hardwoods.  Common trees are cherrybark oak, eastern cottonwood, green ash, sweetgum, American sycamore, water oak, and willow oaks."
