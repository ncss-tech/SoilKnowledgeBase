The reddish subsoil and mica flakes are considered to be a marker of Colorado River sediments.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil survey office lab data available on the typical pedon (NASIS user site id of S2015TX3212500).\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
