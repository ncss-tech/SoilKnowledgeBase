    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is about 30 to 42 inches.  Depth to phosphatic limestone bedrock is about 5 to 10 feet.  Depth to the fragipan is 17 to 28 inches and averages about 23.  Base saturation 30 inches below top of the fragipan is 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly to very strongly acid.  Phosphate content is medium to high in the B horizon and high in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chromas of 4 to 6.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6 with mottles in shades of gray, brown or yellow.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  In some profiles the B horizon has some waterworn pebbles.\nThe 2c horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 through 6, with mottles in shades of brown, yellow or gray or is mottles horizon in shades of brown, yellow or gray.  Texture is silty clay or clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aldino, Ava, Boston, Cincinnati, Grantsburg, Hildebrecht, Hosmer, Lawrenceville, Nicholson, Omulga, Otwell, Rainsboro, Weisburg, and Zanesville soils of the same family.  Mercer soils has higher phosphate content that any of these.  Hildebrecht, Mercer, Nicholson and Weisburg are the only soils that have horizons of silty clay or clay below the fragipan except as minor strata.  Hildebrecht soils have a thicker solum and are underlain by dolomite limestone.  Nicholson soils have a thicker solum and are underlain by residuum of limestone, calcareous shales, and siltstone.  Weisburg soils have a thicker solum and are formed in loess, Illinoian Age till, and residuum from interbedded limestone and gray calcareous shale.  Aldino soils have 5Y hues in the fragipan and angular quartzite pebbles below the fragipans.  Ava soils have more sand and less clay in the horizons below the fragipan.  Boston soils contain glacial pebbles in the fragipan.  Cincinnati soils contain glacial pebbles below the fragipan.  Grantsburg and Hosmer soils contain less clay in the lower part of the fragipan and below and in addition formed in loess more than 4 feet thick.  Lawrenceville soils have less than 27 percent clay in the fine earth fraction of horizons below the fragipan.  Omulga soils have a thicker solum and are formed in loess, colluvium or old alluvium and in most areas underlying locustirine sediments.  Otwell soils are more stratified in the lower part of the control section.  Rainsboro soils have water-sorted sands and gravel in the lower part of the series control section.  Zanesville soils have thinner sola and contain less coarse fragment in the fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mercer soils are on ridgetops and side slopes around the head of drains in the uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  These soils formed partly in loess or old alluvium and partly in the underlying clayey residuum of phosphatic limestones.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 48 inches."
