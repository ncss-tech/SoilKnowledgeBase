  "OVERVIEW": "The Madge series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level or very gently sloping soils are on treads of stream terraces on allurvial plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",
