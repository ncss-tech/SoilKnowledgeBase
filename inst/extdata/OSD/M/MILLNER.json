    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually dry from the about April 30 to November 30, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  Aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric. The soil temperature is above 8.3 degrees C. from about March 1 to December 15, but is rarely below 5 degrees C.  The mean annual soil temperature is 15 to 17.2 degrees C.  The surface pavement covers 35 to 60 percent of the soil surface, with 0 to 5 percent stones.  The soil is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Electrical conductivity is 0 to 2 dS/m.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 8/3, 7/3 or 6/3, and moist color is 10YR 6/3, 5/3, 4/3; or 2.5Y 4/2.  Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 60 percent with 0 to 5 percent angular stones, 1 to 20 percent angular cobbles, and 5 to 40 percent angular gravel.  Textures are gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam or stony sandy loam.  The organic carbon content is 0.15 to 0.3 percent.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR 7/3, 6/3 or 6/4, and moist color is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 2.5Y 4/2.  Rock fragment content averages 35 to 60 percent in the textural control section with 0 to 10 percent angular stones, 5 to 30 percent angular cobbles and 5 to 50 percent angular gravel.  Textures are stratified sandy loam, very gravelly or very cobbly sandy loam and fine sandy loam, or cobbly sandy loam.  The C horizon is slightly or strongly effervescent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Millner soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 5 to 15 percent.  Many of these fans are dissected with small shallow washes and drainages.  Narrow stringers of angular stones and cobbles radiate down the fans from the canyon mounts.  The soils formed in alluvium from metasedimentary and metavolcanic rock sources.  Elevations range from 4,400 to 5,500 feet.  Mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, some as snow.  Mean January temperature is about 1.7 degrees C.; mean July temperature is about 23.8 degrees C.  The mean annual temperature is 11.2 to 13.3 degrees C.  Frost-free season is 150 to 160 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 18 cm (A1 and part of the  A2 horizons)\n1.1 Color values for the surface do not meet mollic color criteria (10YR 8/3, 7/3, 6/3).\nOther Soil Characteristics:\n1.  The soil lacks a subsurface diagnostic horizon because:  no clay films, structure, or well defined layer of segregated lime.\n2.  Organic carbon content is assumed to be less than 0.6 percent and is assumed to decrease regularly with depth.\n3.  Mixed mineralogy is assumed.  Calcareous family due to effervescence throughout control section.\n4.  Particle-size control section is loamy-skeletal (greater than 35 percent rock fragments by volume).  Textural analysis using the hydrometer method employed; stone, cobble, and coarse gravel content estimated by visual inspection; finer gravel content determined using number 10 sieve.\n5.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric - estimated using Thornthwaite water balance method on local meteorological data, limited soil moisture data and vegetation indicators.\n6.  MAP is 6 to 8 inches - determined by extrapolating between weather stations, taking topographical influences into account and using vegetation as indicators.\n7.  The soil temperature regime is on the cool end of thermic.  This is extrapolated from actual soil temperature data over the past years using 12 month averages and Rod Arkley's formula.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
