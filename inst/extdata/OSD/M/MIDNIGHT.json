Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact are 5 to 16 inches.  Angular sandstone and shale fragments range from 35 to 90 percent by volume in the control section.  The soils are neutral or mildly alkaline and range from noncalcareous to calcareous.  The A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It has weak to strong very fine and fine granular structure with moderate to medium plates in the surface inch.  The C horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y.  It is clay loam or loam and ranges in coarse fragments from 75 to 90 percent by volume."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Midnight soils are on steep and very steep, stony and bouldery, convex mountain and foothill slopes at elevations that range from 7,000 to 9,000 feet.  The soils formed in medium and moderately fine textured, stony colluvial, alluvial material weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale.  The climate is continental with mean annual temperature estimated as 44 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature estimated as 63 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is estimated as 17 inches."
