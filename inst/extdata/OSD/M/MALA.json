  "OVERVIEW": "The Mala series consists of well drained soils that formed in recent alluvium. Mala soils are on bottoms of drainage ways and alluvial fans on coastal plains. Slopes are 0 to 7 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 445 millimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 24 degrees C. (75 degrees F.)",
