  "OVERVIEW": "The Mancos series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium derived mostly from shale and sandstone.  Mancos soils are on structural benches and mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
