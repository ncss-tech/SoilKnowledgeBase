Edwardsville, Hacreek, and Higginsville soils have a mean annual temperature above 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F). Harco soils have more than 5 percent sand throughout the series control section. Keller and Loran soils have more than 30 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Also, Loran soils have a paralithic contact between 102 and 152 cm (40 and 60 inches). Nira soils do not have matrix hue range of 10YR or 2.5Y and matrix chroma range of 2 to 4 in the lower third of the series control section (see Remarks)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Muscatune soils are on moderately wide and wide upland ridges or divides and on high stream benches. In a few places, they occur on gently sloping head slopes of drainageways, but this is not the typical landscape. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. They formed in loess typically 1.8 to 3 meters (6 to 10 feet) thick, but extending to 6.1 meters (20 feet) in places. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 991 mm (32 to 39 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.9 to 13.3 degrees C (48 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 140 to 190 days. Elevation is 155 to 313 meters (508 to 1027 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Atterberry, Buckhart, Osco, Sable, Stronghurst and Tama soils. Well drained Osco and Tama soils are on both upslope and downslope positions. Moderately well drained Buckhart soils are on slightly higher positions. Poorly drained Sable soils are in lower positions and are typically surrounded by Muscatune soils. Muscatune soils form a hydrosequence with the Tama, Osco, Buckhart, and Sable soils. They form a biosequence with the Atterberry (intergrade) and Stronghurst (Alfisol) soils, which are on similar landforms."

Seasonal high water table is at depths of 30 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) during the months of November to July in normal years. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Formerly correlated as a taxadjunct of the Muscatine series (Aquic Hapludolls). Data indicates that most pedons of the Muscatine series in northwestern Illinois, and southwestern Wisconsin, and some pedons in eastern Iowa, have at least a 1.2 clay increase within the upper 31 cm (12 inches) of the argillic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from a depth of 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 inches) (Ap, A, and AB horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 51 to 127 cm (20 to 50 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Btg, horizons).\nDifferentia between Nira and Muscatune series needs further study.\nADDITIONAL DATA: An extensive data record, including for the above typical pedon (1986IL187100) is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
