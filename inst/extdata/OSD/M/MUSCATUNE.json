In a few places, they occur on gently sloping head slopes of drainageways, but this is not the typical landscape. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. They formed in loess typically 1.8 to 3 meters (6 to 10 feet) thick, but extending to 6.1 meters (20 feet) in places. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 991 mm (32 to 39 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.9 to 13.3 degrees C (48 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period ranges from 140 to 190 days. Elevation is 155 to 313 meters (508 to 1027 feet) above mean sea level."

Well drained Osco and Tama soils are on both upslope and downslope positions. Moderately well drained Buckhart soils are on slightly higher positions. Poorly drained Sable soils are in lower positions and are typically surrounded by Muscatune soils. Muscatune soils form a hydrosequence with the Tama, Osco, Buckhart, and Sable soils. They form a biosequence with the Atterberry (intergrade) and Stronghurst (Alfisol) soils, which are on similar landforms."
