  "OVERVIEW": "The Manzanst series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on alluvial fans, plains, terraces, drainageways, and valley side slopes.  They formed in fine textured alluvium and loess.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",
