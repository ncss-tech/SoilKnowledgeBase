  "OVERVIEW": "The Murphill series consist of shallow , well drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in residuum from vitric tuffs and basalt.  Murphill soils are on foothills and structural benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 9 inches, and average annual temperature is 51 degrees F.",
