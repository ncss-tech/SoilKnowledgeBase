Colors are for air dry soil unless otherwise stated.)\nA--0 to 3 inches; light yellowish brown (2.5Y 6/4) very gravelly fine sandy loam, olive brown (2.5Y 4/4) moist; moderate fine platy structure parting to moderate fine granular; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; few very fine and fine roots; many very fine and fine vesicular and interstitial pores; 30 percent gravel, 5 percent cobbles; strongly effervescent; mildly alkaline (pH 7.8); clear smooth boundary.

Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  These soils formed in residuum from vitric tuffs and basalt.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and hot and dry in the summer.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches, and average annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 105 to 150 days."
