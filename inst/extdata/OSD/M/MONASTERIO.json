    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Monasterio soils are nearly level to rolling on structural benches and foothills at elevations of 1,463 to 1,981 meters.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium from vitric tuff and basal flow-breccias.  The climate is cool and moist in the winter and warm and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 330 to 460 mm, and average annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 95 days."

Avtable, Cleavage, and Wickahoney soils are less than 50 cm deep to bedrock and on more exposed, higher landscape positions.   Fuego soils lack argillic horizons and are on similar landscape positions.  Saturday soils are loamy-skeletal and are on rocky ridges.  Sharesnout soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section and are on similar landscape positions.  Thacker and Yatahoney soils have indurated duripans between 50 to 100 cm and are on lower fan terraces."
