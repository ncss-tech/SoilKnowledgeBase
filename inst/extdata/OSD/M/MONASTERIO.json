  "OVERVIEW": "The Monasterio series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in residuum and slope alluvium from vitric tuff and breccia.  Monasterio soils are on structural benches and foothills. Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
