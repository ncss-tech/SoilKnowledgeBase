  "OVERVIEW": "The Meadowridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in tuffaceous sediments overlain by loess and ash.  Meadowridge soils are on benches and north-facing slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
