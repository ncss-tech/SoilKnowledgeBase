    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness is 60 inches or\nmore.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in all horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or N, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of\n1 or less.  Texture is loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.  Organic matter content of the A horizon ranges from about 5 to 12 percent.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or\n2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  Total thickness of the A and E horizons is 17 to 30 inches.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma\nof 2; or hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nTexture is sand or fine sand.   The Bh horizon is usually\nsaturated with water and there is little or no cementation.\nHowever, when dry, a weak cementation is evident in most pedons.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3;\nor value of 5, and chroma of 3, with or without dark brownish mottles.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  In some pedons, this\nhorizon is absent.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1\nto 3.  In some pedons, this horizon has few to common gray,\nyellow, or brown mottles.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or N, value of 5 or 6, and chroma\nof 2 or less, or value of 4, and chroma of 1 or less, with or\nwithout yellow and brown mottles.  Texture is fine sandy loam,\nsandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  In some pedons, this horizon contains a few fine streaks and masses of coarser textured\nmaterial in the lower part.  Some pedons have a BC' horizon with\nhue of 10YR or N, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Where present, it ranges from loamy sand to sandy loam in texture.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1\nor 2.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam."

Heaviest rainfall usually occurs during the summer months from about June to October.  Mean annual temperature\nis about 73 degrees F."

Placid soils are sandy to depths of more than\n80 inches.  Jumper, Lochloosa, Pompano, and Sparr soils are better drained and do not have spodic horizons.  In addition, Jumper and Lochloosa soils have thinner A and E horizons and Pompano soils\nare sandy to depths of more than 80 inches."
