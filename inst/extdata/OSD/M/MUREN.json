Glenford soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section and have an irregular decrease in clay content below the maximum within the argillic horizon. Keene soils average more than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

Muren soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Alford soils and the somewhat poorly drained Iva soils. Alford soils are on higher landform positions and do not have iron depletions in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Hosmer soils are on similar landform positions and have fragipans. Princeton soils are on similar landform positions and have fine-loamy argillic horizons. Iva soils are on lower landform positions, have grayer colors in the subsoil and have a water table within a depth of 30 centimeters (1 foot) in most years."
