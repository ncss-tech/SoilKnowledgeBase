Appleriver soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Blair, Bunkum and Geff soils have, in some part of the series control section, a horizon that averages more than 7 percent sand. Fishhook soils average more than 32 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Freeburg soils have a dominant chroma of 2 or less in the series control section. Glenford soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section and have an irregular decrease in clay content below the maximum within the argillic horizon. Keene soils average more than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Reesville, Sugarvalley, Torox and Xenia soils contain carbonates in the series control section within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Muren soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping ridgetops and side slopes on loess hills. The slope gradient is dominantly 0 to 6 percent, but ranges to 30 percent. Muren soils formed in more than 203 cm (80 inches) of loess. The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm  (40 to 46 inches), frost free days range from 170 to 210 days and elevation ranges from 104 to 259 meters (340 to 850 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Alford, Hosmer, Iva, and Princeton soils. Muren soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Alford soils and the somewhat poorly drained Iva soils. Alford soils are on higher landform positions and do not have iron depletions in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Hosmer soils are on similar landform positions and have fragipans. Princeton soils are on similar landform positions and have fine-loamy argillic horizons. Iva soils are on lower landform positions, have grayer colors in the subsoil and have a water table within a depth of 30 centimeters (1 foot) in most years."

The depth to an intermittent apparent high water table is 30 to 76 cm (1.0 foot to 2.5 feet) from December to April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/sec) in the subsoil. Permeability is moderate (0.6 to 2.0 inches per hour)."
