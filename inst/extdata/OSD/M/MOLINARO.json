  "OVERVIEW": "The Molinaro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from noncalcareous sandstone and shale.  Molinaro soils are on terraces, valley floors, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
