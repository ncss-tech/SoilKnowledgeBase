  "OVERVIEW": "The Madeline series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, tuff and andesite.  Madeline soils are on plateaus, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."
