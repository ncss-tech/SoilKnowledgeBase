  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Madeline soils are plateaus, hills, and mountains.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt, tuff, and andesite.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

Karlo soils have more than 60 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are more moderately deep to lithic contacts.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The type location was moved to Washoe County, Nevada, North Part, in 2002 to better represent the series.  Taxonomic classification and range of characteristics were not affected by the move.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 36 cm (A1, A2, and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 48 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 48 cm to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 15 to 48 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nClassification was updated to 11th edition on 07/2011 changed from Lithic Argixerolls to Aridic Lithic Argixerolls.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Previous authors and editors include GAM-DD-TM.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
