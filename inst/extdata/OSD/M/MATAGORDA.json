The E horizon is gray (10YR 5/1), light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/1, 7/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2).  The A and E horizons are very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Within pedons, thickness of the epipedon ranges from 3 to 19 inches within horizontal distances of 3 feet; ranges of average thickness over any pedon are those given in the pedon description.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nInteriors of the peds of the Btg horizon are yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4; 2.5Y 6/4), brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4, 5/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4), grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2).  Fine and medium mottles are in shades of gray, brown, yellow, and red.  Ped Exteriors of the Btg1 horizon are black (10YR 2/1), very dark gray (10YR 3/1), and dark gray (10YR 4/1).  Ped exteriors of the Btg2 horizon are dark gray (10YR 4/1), gray (10YR 5/1), or light gray (10YR 6/1).  The Btg horizon is sandy clay, clay, or clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  The Bt horizon ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline; exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  Salinity ranges from free to moderately affected.  The BC horizon has the same color range as the Btg, except peds are not coated.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.\nThe C horizon is light gray (10YR 7/1, 7/2; 2.5Y 7/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), pinkish gray (7.5YR 6/2), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), pale brown (10YR 6/3), light yellowish brown (10YR 6/4; 2.5Y 6/4), brownish yellow (10YR 6/6), or olive yellow (2.5Y 6/6).

Jarron soils have higher salinity and a different native plant community.  In addition, Jarron soils are ponded for longer periods.  Lindsey, and Verdun soils have mean annual soil temperatures of less than 72 degrees F.  Livia soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and a higher silt content.  Willamar soils have less than 35 percent clay in the Bt horizon."
