  "OVERVIEW": "The Monwebb series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in saline, clayey alluvium derived from the tertiary aged sediments. These nearly level to very gently sloping, occasionally flooded soils are on floodplains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in).",
