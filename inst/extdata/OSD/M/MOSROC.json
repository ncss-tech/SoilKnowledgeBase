  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 9 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick.  The soil is typically noncalcareous throughout, but some pedons are calcareous immediately above the bedrock.  About 25 to 60 percent of the surface is covered with angular pebbles, cobbles, or stones.  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 54 to 49 degrees F.  Stoniness class ranges from 0 to 3.  Rockiness class ranges from\n0 through 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  Coarse fragments range from 15 to 50 percent pebbles, 0 to 20 percent angular cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  Matrix texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 30 to 55 percent pebbles, 0 to 30 percent angular cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon when present has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR; value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Matrix texture is loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Coarse fragments range from 30 to 55 percent pebbles, 5 to 30 percent angular cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mosroc soils are on granite mountain ridges and hillslopes.  Schist and gneiss dikes have dissected the area.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from granite.  Slopes range form 1 to 15 percent.  Elevation is 7,000 to 8,500 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches.  The estimated frost-free season is 60 to 90 days but frost can occur at any time."
