  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from about 14 to 52 cm. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 19 to 25 cm and in some pedons extends into the Bss horizon. When the soil is dry, cracks 1 to 5 cm wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum. The particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. Most pedons do not have rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist or 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bss horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist or 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist or 2 to 4 dry. It typically is clay or silty clay, but is silty clay loam in some pedons. It is slightly or moderately alkaline. Dark tongues ranging from 1 to 5 cm in thickness with a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist or 3 or 4 dry, extend through the Bss horizon.\nThe Bkss horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist or 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It typically is clay or silty clay, but is silty clay loam in some pedons. It is slightly or moderately alkaline. Dark tongues ranging from 1 to 5 cm in thickness with a hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist or 3 or 4 dry extend through the Bkss horizon. Slickensides and pressure faces are often present in this horizon.\nSome pedons have Bk, BC, BCk, or BCy horizons. These horizons have slight to strong effervescence and silty clay textures.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist or 5 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 3 moist or 2 to 4 dry. It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam. Most pedons have inherent redoximorphic features throughout the C horizon. Crystals of gypsum are in some pedons. The C horizon below depths of about 36 inches is laminated in some pedons. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have Cy horizons. These horizons have slight to strong effervescence and silty clay textures."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Minot soils are nearly level to strongly sloping on uplands. Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent. The Minot soils formed in calcareous clayey glacio-lacustrine sediments of ice-walled lakes. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 8 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 340 to 570 mm. Growing season is about 110 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 350 to 470 mm; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000. (Mountrail)"

Mondamin soils have fine argillic horizons. Wildrose soils have mollic epipedons more than 40 cm thick and are on smooth nearly level to gently sloping areas in close association with the Minot soils. Sakakawea soils are coarse-silty. They are on higher positions near the outer rims of the lake plains. The Williams and Zahl soils are formed in glacial till on nearby uplands."
