    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the salic horizon ranges from O to 8 inches. These soils are saturated within depth of 40 inches for one to two months during most years unless artificially drained. The mean annual soil temperature is 63 to 70 F. The 10- to 40-inch control section is clay or silty clay. Subhorizons of clay loam or silty clay loam are in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 1OYR, value of 5, 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2, 3 or 4. The salic horizon has 2 to 3 percent salt and ranges from 16 to 35 inches thick. Small to moderate amounts of gypsum commonly are in subhorizons of most pedons. pH ranges from 7.9 to 9.6."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium dominantly from limestone, quartzite, basalt, latite and shale. The climate is arid with a mean annual precipitation of 4 to 8 inches; a mean annual temperature of 61 to 66 F.; and a frost-free season of approximately 180 to 240 days."
