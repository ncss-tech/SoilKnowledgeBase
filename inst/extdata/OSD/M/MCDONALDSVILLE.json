  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sand typically is 28 to 36 inches and ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 15 to 24 inches in thickness and tongues extend into the B horizon to depths of as much as 30 inches in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam containing 35 to 60 percent clay.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 3 or 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  It is clay, silty clay or clay loam that typically contains 45 to 60 percent clay.  However, the clay content ranges to 35 percent in some pedons.  The Bw horizon is calcareous in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Where chroma is higher than 2, it has low chroma mottles.  It is moderately alkaline.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand or very fine sand.  Some pedons have thin strata of sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or coarse sand.  The 2C horizon contains as much as 5 to 15 percent coarse fragments."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Acasco series as previously classified.  The Acasco soils formed in alluvium principally from basalt, do not have a zone of carbonate accumulation and have up to 35 percent gravel fragments in the particle-size control section and from 15 to 45 percent in the 2C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McDonaldsville soils are on nearly level glacial lake plains, terraces, and deltas.  Slope gradients are less than 3 percent.  The soils formed in glaciolacustrine clay overlying sandy sediments.  The climate is cool, subhumid with long cold winters and short warm summers.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 18 to 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dovray, Fargo, Hegne and Ryan soils on the same lake plains.  These soils do not have sandy 2C horizons within depths of 40 inches.  Other soils on nearby areas are the Bearden, Brantford, Gardena, Glyndon, Overly, Vang and Walsh soils.  Bearden and Overly soils are fine-silty.  Brantford and Vang soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Gardena and Glyndon soils are coarse-silty.  Walsh soils are fine-loamy."
