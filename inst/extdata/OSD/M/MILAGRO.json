  "OVERVIEW": "The Milagro series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitoid rock. The Milagro soils are on alluvial fans and fan skirts. Slope is 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 152 mm (6 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C. (64 degrees F.).",
