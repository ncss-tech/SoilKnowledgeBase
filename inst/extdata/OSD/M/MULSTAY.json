  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 40 to 80 inches thick.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 15 percent and are mainly 10 to 24 inches in diameter.  Rock fragments in the upper two feet are dominantly basalt cobbles and stones and range from 0 to 10 percent by volume.  Rock fragments in the lower part of the profile are mainly fine shale chips which increase in quantity with increasing depth.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 38 to 40 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  This horizon is commonly loam but ranges to light clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist; 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 5.  This horizon is heavy clay loam or clay and averages more than 35 percent clay.  The lower part ranges from clay loam to heavy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y and ranges from clay loam to clay."

The soils formed in material weathered from basalt over material weathered from shale.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F., mean summer temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 40 to 50 days."
