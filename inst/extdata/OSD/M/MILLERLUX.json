  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Millerlux series consists of shallow, well drained soil that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt and tuff with a minor component of loess. Millerlux soils are on basaltic plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
