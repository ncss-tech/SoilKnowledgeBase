    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: MacDunn soils occur on summit (interfluve component), backslope (head slope or side slope components) and footslope positions (base slope component) on steep to very steep side slopes of foothills and mountains along the margins of the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The summit position typically has a convex-linear slope shape; the backslope position is typically concave-convex or convex-convex in shape; while the footslope position is typically linear-convex or convex-concave in shape. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. Elevation is 240 to 2,200 feet. The soils formed in clayey colluvium derived dominantly from the Siletz River Volcanics Formation. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 70 inches. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."

Jory, Nekia and Yamhill soils occur on foothills along the margins of the Willamette Valley, Oregon. Price, Ritner and Witzel soils occur on steep to very steep side slopes of foothills and mountains. Jory and Nekia soils have argillic horizons. Yamhill soils have mollic epipedons and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Price soils are fine textured, have less than 35 percent total rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock. Ritner soils are fine textured, have more than 35 percent total rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Witzel soils are shallower than 20 inches to a lithic contact and have more than 35 percent total rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from 1 to 15 inches (A, AB horizons).\nHumic subgroup - meets color requirements to a depth of 51 inches.\nCambic horizon - from a depth of 15 to 51 inches (Bw1, Bw2, Bw3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - from depths of 11 to 41 inches (part of the AB, all of the Bw1 and Bw2, and part of the Bw3 horizons)\nThis soil was not previously recognized in the Benton County Area Soil Survey report. Field observations and documentation from several counties in the Willamette Valley update area, indicate the MacDunn soils occur consistently and extensively enough to be recognized and mapped as a named soil series. MacDunn soils occur on the Looney geomorphic surface. Depths to diagnostic horizons and features in the range of characteristics start from the mineral soil surface. Lab data from the MacDunn type location and on similar soils indicate a superactive CEC activity class and more than 60 percent base saturation. This resulted in a change in classification to clayey-skeletal, mixed, superactive, mesic Humic Haploxerepts\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data available for sample # S00OR-003-005, NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
