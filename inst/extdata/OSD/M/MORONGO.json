  "REVDATE": "11/2015",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Morongo series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Morongo soils are on fan aprons, inset fans, fan remnants and in drainageways. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 138 millimeters (5.5 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 18.5 degrees C (65 degrees F).",

Azulugar, Bluepoint, Brazito, Cajon, Koehn, Maynard Lake, Moapa, Toquop, and Yturbide soils allow effervescence throughout the control section. In addition, Azulugar soils receive more than 200 millimeters (8 inches) of precipitation, and are moist for more than 20 days cumulative between July and September. Brazito, Copia and Yturbide soils are also intermittently moist in the soil moisture control section for more than 20 days from July to September. Bigcanyon soils formed in colluvium over residuum and have a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 centimeters (20 and 40 inches). Birdcanyon and Koehn soils are not intermittently moist in some part of the control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September following summer convection storms. Bluepoint and Hembrillo soils formed in eolian materials and allow gypsum in the control section with Hembrillo soils having between 20 and 50 percent gypsum in the control section. Copia soils formed from mixed alluvium and have hues of 2.5YR to 7.5YR. Maynard Lake soils contain more than 20 percent pumice and volcanic ash. Moapa soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 53 to 98 centimeters (21 to 38 inches), are formed from eolian sands, and are on sand sheets over sandstone rock pediments. Pintura soils have hues of 2.5 YR or 5YR and formed in eolian sands derived from sandstone. Yander soils are formed in alluvium over granitic residuum on fan aprons over pediment and have a paralithic contact between 100 and 150 centimeters (40 and 60 inches)."
