Electrical conductivity is 2 to 16 mmhos. throughout.  The soil is calcareous in all parts with disseminated carbonates.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick.  The particle-size control section has 35 to 50 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe Ap and Akn horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.  It is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bkn and Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry.
