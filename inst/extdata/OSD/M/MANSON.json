  "OVERVIEW": "The Manson series consists of very deep, well-drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous, loamy sediments derived from the upper part of the Ogallala Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These soils are on gently to moderately sloping interfluves or broad erosion remnants.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 496 mm (18 in) and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
