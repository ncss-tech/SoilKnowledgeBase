These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, or calcareous siltstone.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,130 to 3,355 meters.  The climate is dry-subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 460 mm.The mean annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C.The frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
