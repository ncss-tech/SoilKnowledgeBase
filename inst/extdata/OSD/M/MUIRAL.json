  "OVERVIEW": "The Muiral series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone, dolomite, or calcareous siltstone. Muiral soils are on mountains. Slopes are 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
