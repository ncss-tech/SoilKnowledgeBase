  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mosesprairie series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils derived from organic material over glaciolacustrine deposits. Mosesprairie soils are on proglacial lakes on till plains with slopes of 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 110 inches, the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Depth to sapric material is 24 to 35 inches.\nThe Oi horizon has hue of 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 2.5 moist and 3 dry, and chroma of 1 moist and dry, broken, rubbed, or pressed. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Oe layer has hue of 10YR, value of 2 moist and 3 dry, and chroma of 1 moist and dry, broken, rubbed, or pressed. Reaction is ultra acid or extremely acid.\nThe Oa layer has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 moist and 3 dry, and chroma of 1 moist and dry, broken, rubbed, or pressed.

There is a greater thickness of hemic material within the subsurface tier than any other type of organic material, therefore, hemist.\nThe organic material contains a layer of sapric material from 26 to 55 inches, therefore, sapric subgroup.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
