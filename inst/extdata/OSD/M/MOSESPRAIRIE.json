The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 120 inches. The average January temperature is about 40 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. The frost free season is 160 to 220 days."

There is a greater thickness of hemic material within the subsurface tier than any other type of organic material, therefore, hemist.\nThe organic material contains a layer of sapric material from 26 to 55 inches, therefore, sapric subgroup.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
