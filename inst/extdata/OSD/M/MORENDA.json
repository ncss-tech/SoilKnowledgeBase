  "OVERVIEW": "The Morenda series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist. Morenda soils are on treads of low stream terraces and inset fans of valley floors. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

(upper boundary of the 2Cg1 horizon)\nEndosaturation - - Observed saturation at 58 inches and also inferred from the low chroma in the 2Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and part of the BC horizon)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006."
