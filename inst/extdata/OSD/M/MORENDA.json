    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Morenda soils are on treads of low stream terraces and inset fans of valley floors. They formed in alluvium derived from Precambrian granite, gneiss, and schist. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,800 to 8,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches with about 40 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."

Espanola soils are loamy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons, and occur on risers of high stream terraces. Fiesta soils are fine-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on footslopes of valley sides."

(upper boundary of the 2Cg1 horizon)\nEndosaturation - - Observed saturation at 58 inches and also inferred from the low chroma in the 2Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons.\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the Bw1, Bw2, Bw3, and part of the BC horizon)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon sampled as S99NM-049-001 by NSSL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
