  "OVERVIEW": "The Mirand series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived dominantly from rhyolite and tuff.  Mirand soils are on sideslopes of mountains and canyons and have slopes of 0 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 25 inches and about 60 percent of the precipitation is from snow and winter rain and 40 percent from heavy summer storms.
