  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in old alluvium from various sources but mainly rhyolite and tuff.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 25 inches and about 60 percent of the precipitation is from snow and winter rain and 40 percent from heavy summer storms.  The frost-free period is 60 to 115 days.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 to 46 degrees F."
