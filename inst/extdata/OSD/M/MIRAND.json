  "OVERVIEW": "The Mirand series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived dominantly from rhyolite and tuff.  Mirand soils are on sideslopes of mountains and canyons and have slopes of 0 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
