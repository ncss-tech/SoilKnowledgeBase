  "OVERVIEW": "The Moltke series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits on lake plains, outwash plains, and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.6 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
