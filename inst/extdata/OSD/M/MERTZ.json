  "OVERVIEW": "The Mertz series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvial or glacial material derived from limestone containing various amounts of chert fragments.  Slopes range from 3 to 35 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 42 inches and dominantly exceeds 72 inches.  Rock fragments are primarily chert but some are angular sandstone and shale, particularly in the lower horizons.  Fragments in individual horizons of the soil range from 15 to 50 percent by volume in the upper part of the solum and from 15 to 80 percent in the lower part and C horizon.  The weighted average rock fragment content of the top 20 inches of the Bt horizon is 35 to 50 percent by volume.  The reaction ranges from neutral to strongly acid in the upper part of the solum and is strongly or very strongly acid below about 40 inches.  Lithologic discontinuities in the solum are common but are absent in some pedons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4; dry value is 6 or 7.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have a thin silt loam E horizon and others have a BA or BE horizon which is less than 10 inches thick.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8; the redder hues are normally in the lower solum.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam.  The weighted average clay content in the top 20 inches of the Bt horizon ranges from 27 to 35 percent.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine through coarse subangular blocky or blocky.  Some pedons have coarse or very coarse prismatic structure.  Consistence is firm or friable.\nSome pedons have C horizons with color and texture similar to the B horizon."

Elliber soils average more than 50 percent rock fragments and less than 27 percent clay in the top 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Gainesboro, Hartleton, and Irondale have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Lew soils contain fragments of greenstone.  Pattenburg soils have hue of 2.5YR or redder."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 48 inches, and the frost free season ranges from 150 to 210 days."
