  "OVERVIEW": "The Marshneck series consists of very deep, subaqueous soils permanently submerged beneath up to 250 cm of tidal estuarine water on flood tidal delta slopes and shoals in coastal lagoons and bays. Marshneck soils are formed in coarse loamy marine and estuarine sediments transported by flood tidal currents and estuarine silts settling in low energy areas. Slope ranges from 2 through 5 percent, mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm.",

Peraquic feature - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 0.6 m of water at the time of coring).\n2. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 19 cm (A horizon).\n3. Sulfidic materials - the zone from 19 to 97 cm (CAse, Cse, CA'se, and C'se horizons).\n4. High n-value - the zone from 0 to 19 cm (A horizon) has an n-value greater than 0.7, as surmised by the moderately fluid manner of failure.\n5. Haplic Feature - the zone from 19 to 303 has an n-value of 0.7 or less.\n6. Particle size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of the CAse, Cse, CA'se, C'se, and part of the Cg horizons)."
