  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This subaqueous series is being proposed in areas previously mapped as water in the Rhode Island and Connecticut Soil Surveys.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Peraquic feature - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 0.6 m of water at the time of coring).\n2. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 19 cm (A horizon).\n3. Sulfidic materials - the zone from 19 to 97 cm (CAse, Cse, CA'se, and C'se horizons).\n4. High n-value - the zone from 0 to 19 cm (A horizon) has an n-value greater than 0.7, as surmised by the moderately fluid manner of failure.\n5. Haplic Feature - the zone from 19 to 303 has an n-value of 0.7 or less.\n6. Particle size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 cm (part of the CAse, Cse, CA'se, C'se, and part of the Cg horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon sample RI009-2007-014-PJ in Washington County, Rhode Island, by University of Rhode Island.  Additional pedons used to determine ranges include RI009-2000-002-NP, RI009-2007-012-PJ, RI009-2007-005-PJ, and RI009-2006-015-QP (Sampled by the University of Rhode Island).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
