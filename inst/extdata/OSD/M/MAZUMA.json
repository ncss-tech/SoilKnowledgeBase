Fang soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days between July and October and have quantities of volcanic glass.  Fruitland soils have sodium adsorption ratios of less than 13, do not have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates, and lack significant stratification in the particle-size control section.  Ganaflan, Vanderhoff, Wentridge, and Worland soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Geer soils average 15 to 30 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section.  Kumiva soils have sodium adsorption ratios of less than 13 and texture of silt loam and loam in the particle-size control section.  Jeddito soils have sodium adsorption ratios of less than 13 and are intermittently moist between July and September.  Jenrid and Shotnick soils have sodium adsorption ratios of less than 13 and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C.  Marcou soils are intermittently moist between July and September and have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR.  Moepitz soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Piltdown soils have sodium adsorption ratios of less than 13, have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C., and do not have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mazuma soils are on basin-floor remnants, lagoons, beach plains, alluvial flats, fan skirts, and stream terraces  These soils formed mainly in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Surface deposits of eolian sand occur in some areas.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent in Nevada and California and range up to 30 percent in Idaho.  Elevations are 1,180 to 1,920 meters in Nevada and California and 700 to 945 meters in Idaho.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is 7 to 12 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days in Nevada and California and 130 to 150 days in Idaho."
