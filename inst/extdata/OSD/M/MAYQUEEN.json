Brinkerhoff soils have gypsum at 20 inches. Chacoan soils are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock. Delp soils have an argillic horizon composed of lamellae and are slightly or strongly effervescent and very strongly alkaline in the series control section. Enos soils have paralithic contacts of 20 to 40 inches.   Granshaw soils have Btk and Bk horizons. Shiprock and Wallson soils lack sandy textures within 40 inches of the surface.  Woolsey soils have gravelly argillic horizons and are calcareous throughout."

Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations range from 5,600 to 6,400 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches.  Average annual air temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F.  Average frost-free season ranges from 140 to 160 days."

New Mexico is proposing transferring the series and type location to San Juan County, New Mexico.  The soils previously mapped Mayqueen in Nevada have been correlated into the Patna series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
