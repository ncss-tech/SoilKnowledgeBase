  "OVERVIEW": "The Monte series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in medium textured alluvium from rhyolite or latite rocks.  Monte soils are on fans and flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  The soils range from neutral to strongly alkaline.  The control section averages 0 to 5 percent gypsum.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos above a depth of 24 inches except that thin subhorizons totaling less than 4 inches in thickness and containing more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium or with conductivity exceeding 14 millimhos occur inconsistently in some pedons.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent fine or coarser sand and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments that range mainly in diameter from 1 to 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3."
