Depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  The soils range from neutral to strongly alkaline.  The control section averages 0 to 5 percent gypsum.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent and conductivity ranges from 0 to 14 millimhos above a depth of 24 inches except that thin subhorizons totaling less than 4 inches in thickness and containing more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium or with conductivity exceeding 14 millimhos occur inconsistently in some pedons.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent fine or coarser sand and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments that range mainly in diameter from 1 to 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3."
