  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness commonly ranges between 36 and 66 inches.  Typically, carbonates are absent to a depth of many feet below the solum; however, some pedons have carbonates oriented along cleavage faces in the lower part of the 2Bt horizon.  The solum typically averages between 5 and 15 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam with a clay content ranging from 28 to 34 percent.  The A horizon typically is medium or slightly acid but ranges to neutral in some pedons.\nThe 2Bt horizon typically has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  If the matrix has 10YR hue, reddish mottles are in the 2Bt horizon and range in abundance from common to many.  Few to many mottles with value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 are in the 2Bt horizon.  Mottles increase in size and abundance with depth.  The 2Bt horizon is silty clay with a clay content ranging from 40 to 50 percent.  Clay films are distinctly evident, but many of these are probably related to the paleosol rather than the present modern soil.  Many of the properties of the B horizons are believed to be inherited from the exhumed paleosol.  B/A clay ratios are greater than 1.2.  The 2Bt horizon typically is slightly acid or neutral.  A 2BC horizon is in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  The average clay content typically is 28 to 35 percent but the range is to 38 percent.  It is slightly acid or neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adair, Arispe, Chase, Flanagan, Greenton, Grundy, Herrick, Ipava, Keller, Lagonda, Lamoni, Macksburg, Mahaska, Martin, Mayberry, Pawnee, Rutland, Seymour, Shorewood, Tina, and Wymore soils in the same family.  All of these soils except the Adair and Mayberry soils are less red in hue.  Adair soils contain more that 15 percent sand in the solum and, in addition, have a stone line in the upper part of the B horizon.  Mayberry soils typically have thicker sola and, in addition, contain more sand throughout the solum and more clay in the lower part of the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Malvern soils are on low convex summits of narrow interfluves and convex sideslopes on uplands.  They most commonly occur as a narrow band on sideslopes where geologic erosion has exhumed the Sangamon paleosols.  Slope gradients range from 5 to 14 percent.  These soils formed in Sangamon paleosols formed in Loveland loess, except the upper 10 to 20 inches formed from Wisconsin loess.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 49 to 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 28 to 34 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Adair soils and the Ida, Marshall, Monona, and Shelby soils.  Ida, Marshall, and Monona soils lack the reddish hues and silty clay textures and are on slopes above the Malvern soils.  Adair and Shelby soils are downslope and contain more sand and gravel-size material."
