  "OVERVIEW": "The Manido series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on outwash plains, stream terraces, lake plains and outwash fans. These soils formed in sandy outwash. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
