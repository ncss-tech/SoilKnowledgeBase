  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bechyn, Bendena, Copaston, Emeline, and Huntley series. Bechyn soils overlie granite, gneiss, or quartzite bedrock. Bendena and Emeline soils have more than 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Copaston and Huntley soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 25 cm (10 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marblehead soils are on reefs on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in a thin mantle of loamy glaciolacustrine deposits over limestone or dolostone of Silurian or Devonian age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 238 meters (600 to 780 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the well drained Castalia and Dunbridge soils. Both soils are underlain with limestone or dolostone at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). In addition, the Castalia have a cambic horizon with rock fragment content between 35 and 90 percent. They are on backslopes and summits of convex reefs. Also, the Dunbridge soils have an argillic horizon. They are on positions on reefs and beaches where thicker deposits of loamy glaciolacustrine material accumulated."
