  "OVERVIEW": "The Marias series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium or glaciolacustrine or lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, lake plains, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
