  "OVERVIEW": "The Meadowport series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on terraces.  They formed in glacial lake-laid sediments and old alluvium derived from granite and schist, with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F and average annual precipitation is about 60 inches.",
