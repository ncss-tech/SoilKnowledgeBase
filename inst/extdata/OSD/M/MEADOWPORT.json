These soils formed in glacial lacustrine sediments and old alluvium derived from granite and schist, with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Elevations range from 3700 to 4000 feet.   The average annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F, average annual precipitation is 50 to 65 inches, and frost-free season is 30 to 100 days (9 in 10 years to 1 in 10 years, respectively)."
