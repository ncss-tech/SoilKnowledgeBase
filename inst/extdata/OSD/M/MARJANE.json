Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 6,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches with about half falling as winter snow and half falling as rain from high intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
