  "OVERVIEW": "The Marjane series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to sandstone.  Marjane soils formed in eolian and residuum derived from sandstone on footslopes of undulating plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
