Blackmagic soils have an accumulation of gypsum within 40 inches of the surface.  Blackmagic, Haps and Tres Hermanos soils contain 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Blackmagic, Jagerson, Kidwell, Lanip and Poachie soils occur in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30), receive mostly winter precipitation and are moist for less than 20 days cumulative during July-September.  Brenda soils have gravelly sand or fine sand in the lower part of the profile below the argillic horizon.  Cornville soils contain more than 50 percent sand in the particle size control section.  Cornville soils also have Bt horizons thicker than 10 inches and have solum thickness greater than 25 inches.  Dona Ana soils have the base of the argillic horizon within 28 inches of the surface.  Also they have BA horizons.  Dona Ana soils are effervescent throughout the PSCS and have calcic horizon beginning at 2 inches depth.  Elizario soils have a calcic horizon at depths greater than 20 inches.  Jagerson soils have greater than 15 percent rock fragments in the series control section.  Kidwell soils have greater than 15 percent rock fragments in the series control section.  Mcnew and Nutt soils argillic horizons thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches thick.\nMohave soils contain 27 to 40 percent clay in the PSCS.  Mohave soils have less than 50 percent sand in the series control section.  Nutt soils have a soil temperature of 59-62 degrees F. and have a calcic horizon above the argillic horizon.  Poachie soils have cambic horizon above the argillic horizon.\nTres Hermanos soils are effervescent throughout.  Tres Hermanos and Cornville soils clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent in the PSCS."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mcnew soils are on alluvial flats of basin floors at elevations of 3,900 to 4,300 feet.  These soils formed in eolian sands over alluvium.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The driest months are March and April. Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.  The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."
