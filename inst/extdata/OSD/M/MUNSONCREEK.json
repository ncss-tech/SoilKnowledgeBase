The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. The depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. The umbric epipedon is 15 to 35 inches thick. The hue is 10YR or 7.5YR throughout. Andic soil properties do not extend beyond 14 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is medial silt loam and has 0 to 15 percent grave; and 0 to 15 percent paragravel. It has an acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, phosphate-retention of more than 85 percent, and 15-bar moisture of more than 15 percent (air dried).\nThe AB horizon, when present, has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry.

If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
