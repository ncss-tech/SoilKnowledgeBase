  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Millington soils are on flood plains. Slope gradients are less than 2 percent. The soils formed in dark colored, stratified calcareous alluvium derived principally from Mollisols that formed in drift and loess of Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6 to 12 degrees C (43 to 54 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 640 to 940 mm (25 to 37 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 130 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 165 to 457 meters (540 to 1500 feet) above mean sea level."

Lawson and Otter soils are noncalcareous and are on similar positions. In addition, they contain less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle-size control section."

Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 46 cm (1.5 feet) below the surface at some time in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) but can range to 42.34 micrometers per second in the substratum. Permeability is moderate but can range to  moderately rapid in the substratum. This soil is subject to rare to common flooding"
