Mean annual air temperature ranges from 6 to 12 degrees C (43 to 54 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 640 to 940 mm (25 to 37 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 130 to 180 days.

The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) but can range to 42.34 micrometers per second in the substratum. Permeability is moderate but can range to  moderately rapid in the substratum. This soil is subject to rare to common flooding"
