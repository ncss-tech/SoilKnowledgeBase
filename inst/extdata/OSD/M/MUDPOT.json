  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is inundated with water during the winter and early spring.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to mottles is 3 to 15 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 10 to 30 inches.  The subsoil cracks and develops slickensides; cracks extend upward to the base of the A horizon.  The cracks are open from about mid-August through mid-November.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 5 percent gravel and 40 to 60 percent clay.  Hue is 2.5Y or 5Y.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry, 2 moist.\nThe Bw horizon is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  It has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.\nThe Bk horizon is silty clay or clay.  It has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist."

The soils formed in lacustrine sediments derived primarily from basalt and tuff.  Water ponds in winter and spring after snow melt and heavy rains.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."

Langslet soils are somewhat poorly drained, have an aridic soil moisture regime, and are on the adjacent higher terrace.  Spangenburg and Swalesilver soils have an argillic horizon and are on the higher terraces."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This series is not presently classified as a vertisol because the cracks do not extend through the A horizon to the surface. The proposed changes to Soil Taxonomy will probably place this series as Aquerts\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - moist value of 4 and 5 to a depth of 14 inches.\nCambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 60 inches.\nAquic soil moisture regime - mottling with chroma of 2 or less from 5 to 14 inches.\nTypic subgroup of Haplaquepts - moist chroma of 2 or less throughout the profile.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
