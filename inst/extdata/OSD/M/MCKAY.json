  "OVERVIEW": "The McKay series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and old alluvium.  McKay soils are on alluvial fans below the foothills of the Blue Mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
