  "OVERVIEW": "The Martineck series is a member of the clayey-skeletal, montmorillonitic, mesic, shallow family of Aridic Durixerolls.  Typically, Martineck soils have grayish brown and gray, platy, medium acid, extremely stony sandy loam A1 horizons, brown, prismatic, medium acid, extremely stony, sandy clay B2t horizons underlain by an indurated pan at a depth of 19 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a very strongly cemented or indurated horizon is 10 to 20 inches.  The soil is moist from about November 15 until June 15.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 48 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F. from March 15 to November 15 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from April 1 to November 1.  Stones and cobblestones cover 3 to 15 percent of the surface.  The soil profile above the duripan contains 40 to 80 percent by volume of rock fragments.   Fragments are mostly cobblestones and stones.  The soil is slightly to medium acid throughout.  The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  It is coarse sandy loam to loam.  The B2t horizon has value of 3 through 5.  It is sandy clay loam to clay.  The upper boundary of the Bt horizon is clear or gradual or there is a transition horizon.  The absolute increase in clay from A horizon to B2t horizon is somewhat less than 15 percent in 1 inch or 20 percent in 2 1/2 inches.  The IICm horizon has silica coatings resembling lime but is noneffervescent.  This horizon lacks the rock fragments of the overlying solum."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bieber, Gacey, and Zoate series.  Bieber soils have less than 35 percent by volume of rock fragments.  Gacey soils are neutral and have gravel in the cemented duripans.  Zoate soils are underlain by bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches and are neutral to mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Martineck soils are gently sloping to moderately steep and are on undulating to hilly terraces at elevations of 4,500 to 5,200 feet.  They formed in cobbly and stony alluvium mostly derived from basic igneous rock sources and are underlain by indurated to consolidated lake sediments.  The climate is cool semiarid with mean annual precipitation of about 12 to 18 inches.  The average January temperature is about 28 degrees F., July average temperature is about 68 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is about 30 to 90 days."
