  "OVERVIEW": "The McCrosket series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed on mountains and foothills. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite, that is influenced with mixed volcanic ash and loess in the surface layers. Slopes range from 5 to about 65 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

They occupy northerly aspects at lower elevations, and they occupy southerly aspects and ridgetops at higher elevations. Slopes range from 5 percent to 65 percent. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite with a mantle of loess mixed with minor amounts of volcanic ash. Elevations range from 2200 to 4000 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 35 inches.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is from 90 to 130 days."
