  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McCrosket soils are on mountains and footslopes. They occupy northerly aspects at lower elevations, and they occupy southerly aspects and ridgetops at higher elevations. Slopes range from 5 percent to 65 percent. They formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from metasedimentary bedrock, predominantly siltite and fine grained quartzite with a mantle of loess mixed with minor amounts of volcanic ash. Elevations range from 2200 to 4000 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 35 inches.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is from 90 to 130 days."

Ardenvoir soils have an ochric epipedon and occupy all aspects of adjacent mountains and foothills. Huckle soils have thick volcanic ash mantles and occupy northerly aspects on adjacent mountains and foothills. Tekoa soils have an argillic horizon, are moderately deep, and occupy convex positions on southerly aspects. Rasser soils are very deep, have an ochric epipedon, and occupy easterly aspects on linear positions of adjacent foothills and mountains."
