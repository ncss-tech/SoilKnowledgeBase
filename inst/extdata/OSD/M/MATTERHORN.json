  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches and may include part of the Bk1 horizon. The depth to the calcic horizon is 10 to 15 inches. The particle-size control section averages less than 5 percent clay and more than 65 percent rock fragments.\nThe Ak horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry and has 5 to 10 percent clay. The Ak1 horizon has 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. The Ak2 horizon is cobbly sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 10 percent in the Ak horizons. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk1 horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. The Bk2 and Bk3 horizons are multicolored. The texture is loamy sand or sand with 20 to 50 percent cobbles, 15 to 50 percent gravel, and 0 to 10 percent stones. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 20 percent in the Bk1 and Bk2 horizons and 5 to 10 percent in the Bk3 horizon."
