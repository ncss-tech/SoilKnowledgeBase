  "OVERVIEW": "The Mulgon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium.  Mulgon soils are on mountains and alluvial fans along mountain fronts.  Slopes range from 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

(Bt/E horizon)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 17 to 33 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nRemarks:\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nPercent base saturation for assignment to the mollic subgroup is estimated.\nGlossic horizon is assumed to exist based on the presence of the Bt/E but cannot be confirmed since the description lacks percentages of Bt vs. E.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This soil formally classified as Mollic Cryoboralfs prior to the 1996 Keys.  Classification according to the 1996 Keys was Glossic Cryoboralf, loamy-skeletal, mixed, superactive.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
