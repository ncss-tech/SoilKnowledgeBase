  "OVERVIEW": "The Mindego series comprises dark-colored, fine-textured, well-drained soils developing under timber in weathered basic igneous rocks.  They appear to be grumusolic in some respects, but have textural B horizons.  They form in Coast Range valleys in California where the climate is mild and humid.  Summers are warm, rainless and foggy; winters are cool and wet.  Average annual rainfall is from 40 to 50 inches, mean annual temperature from 53 to 57 degrees F.  Parent rocks are mainly basalt and diabase, probably with some mantle of slope wash from Mindego and related soils.  Sweeney soils form in the same kind of parent material, but they are browner colored, generally shallower to bedrock, develop under grass with scattered trees, and have more distinct horizonation.",
