  "OVERVIEW": "The Mott series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy and sandy alluvium.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy sediments and rapid in the sandy sediments.  These soils are on fans and terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 14 inches.",

Belain, Bitterroot, Chincap, and Vebar soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches. Hopley and Tally soils have carbonates higher in the profiles.  Panguitch and Victor soils contain more coarse fragments.  In addition, Panquitch soils have a Bk horizon.  Relan soils have redder hue.  Chinook soils are dry for longer periods.  Manning soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Parshall and Ruso soils are pachic.  Shambo soils are fine-loamy."
