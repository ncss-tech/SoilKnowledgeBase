The soil contains 1 to 10 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It typically is sandy loam but the range includes loam and sandy clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is sandy loam or fine sandy loam but the range includes loam.\nThe upper C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe lower C horizon typically is coarse sand or loamy coarse sand; but contains thin strata of coarser or finer textures in some pedons."

Belain, Bitterroot, Chincap, and Vebar soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches. Hopley and Tally soils have carbonates higher in the profiles.  Panguitch and Victor soils contain more coarse fragments.  In addition, Panquitch soils have a Bk horizon.  Relan soils have redder hue.  Chinook soils are dry for longer periods.  Manning soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Parshall and Ruso soils are pachic.  Shambo soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mott soils are on nearly level and gently sloping fans and terraces that extend several miles from the base of buttes.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in loamy and sandy alluvium containing some bentonite clay.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 14 to 17 inches.  Most of the precipitation falls in the spring and summer."
