  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 11 to 30 inches.  The depth to soft shale, sandstone, or siltstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Glacial stones are common in the surface layer in the eastern and northern part of the geographic range of the soil.  Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam and commonly 20 to 26 percent clay, but a range of 18 to 35 percent is permitted.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It typically has moderate or strong coarse to fine prismatic and angular or subangular blocky structure.  Peds in the Bt horizon have faint continuous or patchy clay films.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It contains both diffuse and segregated carbonates.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 10 to 20 percent.\nSome pedons have a C horizon above the Cr horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Morton soils are on level to rolling plains.  Slope gradient is commonly 0 to 6 percent, but it ranges to 15 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from soft calcareous silty shales, siltstones, mudstones, and fine grained sandstones.  Some areas have a thin glacial till mantle.  Mean annual air temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Farland soils and the Arnegard, Belfield, Flasher, Grail, Regent, Rhoades, Savage, Vebar, Werner and Williams soils. The Farland and Savage soils are mainly in the stream valleys and on foot slopes.  Savage soils are fine and do not have soft bedrock within depths of 40 inches.  Arnegard and Grail soils are in concave swales and flats below the Morton soils. They have a mollic epipedon greater than 16 inches thick and do not have soft bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches.  Belfield, Regent, Rhoades and Vebar soils are on the same plain as the Morton soils. Belfield and Rhoades soils have natric horizons and are fine.  Regent soils are fine.   Vebar soils are coarse-loamy and underlain by soft sandstone.  Flasher and Werner soils are on the steeper hilltops and ridges.  They are less than 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  In addition, Flasher soils are sandy.  Williams soils are associated with Morton soils in a few localities where thick glacial till is intermixed with silty residual material.  They are fine-loamy and are formed in glacial till."
