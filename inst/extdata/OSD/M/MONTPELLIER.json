  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Dense weakly cemented layers are at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F and the temperature remains above 47 degrees F throughout the year.  The soil is dry between 6 and 18 inches in most years from June 1 to October 15, moist in all parts from Dec 1 to May 1 and moist in some part the rest of the year.  Weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is 25 to 35 percent clay.  They have more than 15 percent coarse plus very coarse sand throughout.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 5YR 4/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/2, 4/4; 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/4, 5/3 or 5/2.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/4, 3/4; 10YR 4/4, 4/3 or 4/2.  Texture is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Content of gravel is 0 to 5 percent.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  The AB or BA horizons when present may have faint mottles and slightly greater clay content.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 2.5YR 5/6, 5/5, 5/4; 5YR 6/6, 6/4, 5/4, 5/6, 4/4; Moist color is 2.5YR 4/6, 4/4, 3/4; 5YR 5/4, 4/6, 4/4.  Faint mottles or manganese stains are present in some pedons.  Texture ranges from coarse sandy loam to sandy clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  The Bt horizons are dense and clay films fill the pores.  Clay content and clay films decrease with increasing depth.\nWhen a Btq horizon is present below a B horizon, it has similar color and reaction as Bt horizons.  They have clay films with weak silica cementation.  The horizon is dense and brittle, but not a duripan, and crushes to a sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Content of gravel is 0 to 5 percent.  In some pedons, a C horizon is present."

The Accelerator and Pomo soils have less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand, have 10YR or 2.5Y Bt horizons and have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.  Arbuckle soils have 10YR or 7.5YR Bt horizons and formed in gravelly alluvium.  Blasingame, Bressa, Sesame and Tivy soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Borden soils have mildly to strongly alkaline argillic horizons that are calcareous below 21 inches.  Creviscreek soils have a lithologic discontinuity within 40 inches and have a solum thickness of 25 to 39 inches.  Fallbrook soils have argillic horizons that usually have 18 to 25 percent clay content and have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.  Snelling soils have 10YR or 7.5YR hues in the control section.  Wasioja soils are calcareous in the argillic horizon and are aridic bordering on xeric.  Wyman soils have less than 15 percent coarse and very coarse sand in the control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Montpellier soils occur on nearly level to hilly dissected terraces formed on old alluvium from granitic rock sources.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  They occur at elevations of 100 to 500 feet in a dry subhumid climate with mean annual rainfall of 10 to 20 inches, with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is 60 to 62 degrees F., average January temperature 43 degrees F., and average July temperature 78 to 81 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 250 to 300 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The soils were formerly classified in the (medial) Noncalcic brown group.\nThis update moved the Type Location from Stanislaus County to San Joaquin County.  Soils mapped in Stanislaus County (18,309 acres) have solum thickness and depth to a restricted layer ranging from 12 to 26 inches.  In addition the AWC is 1 to 4 inches.  It is assumed that the moisture control section (MCS) will not meet the requirements for the Typic Haploxeralfs subgroup and they will classify as Aridic Haploxeralfs as proposed by California as an amendment to Soil Taxonomy.\nSoils mapped in Eastern Fresno, Merced and San Joaquin Counties are representative of the series concept.  About 159 acres mapped in Merced County with slopes 30 to 45 percent, will also be excluded from the series concept.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in January of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 11 inches (A1,A2)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 20 to 43 inches (Bt1,Bt2,Bt3)\nCemented underlying layers - the zone from 55 to 60 inches (Btq).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
