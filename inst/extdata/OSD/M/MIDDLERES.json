Elevations range from 4,900 to 5,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches much of which comes as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 0.8 and 1.7 feet (shallow free water occurrence class) from January to June.  Water levels drop as low as 4 feet between July and December.  Cumulative annual duration class is Permanent.  These soils are susceptible to frequent ponding for very long duration from March through June with water up to 1 foot deep.  Some phases are susceptible to rare flooding for brief periods between March and May."
