  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 34 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of about 20 inches is about 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time. The soil is usually dry and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days.  Estimated electrical conductivity ranges from 20 to 70 mmhos/cm and SAR is 13 to 40 in the solum.\nThe varnished desert pavement consists of well rounded or subangular pebbles or cobbles ranging from 3/8 to 5 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon is light yellowish brown or very pale brown (10YR 6/4, 7/4).  Moist colors are yellowish brown or very pale brown (10YR 6/4, 7/4).  Moist colors are yellowish brown or dark yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 4/4).  This horizon is typically sandy loam with 5 to 12 percent clay and 5 to 10 percent fine gravel.  Structure ranges from weak thin to strong thick platy.  A few pedons have moderate fine subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon is yellowish red, reddish yellow, or reddish brown (5YR 5/6, 6/6, 5/4).  Moist colors are yellowish red or reddish brown (5YR 4/6, 4/4).  This horizon is sandy clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam, or clay loam and averages 20 to 30 percent clay.  Fine gravel is 10 to 35 percent.  This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe B3t horizon is reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6, 7/6; 5YR 7/8).  Moist colors are strong brown or yellowish red (7.5YR 5/6; 5YR 5/8).  This horizon is gravelly sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy loam with 20 to 35 percent fine gravel.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Lime is disseminated and the horizon is weakly to strongly effervescent.  Lime occurs as filaments, threads, or fine and medium soft masses in lower parts.  Some pedons lack carbonates in this horizon.\nThe C horizon is light yellowish brown or very pale brown (10YR 6/4, 7/3, 7/4).  Moist colors are yellowish brown, pale brown or light yellowish brown (10YR 6/3, 5/4, 6/4).  This horizon is gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand.  Fine gravel is 20 to 50 percent.  This horizon is strongly or violently effervescent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 8 to 15 percent mainly disseminated."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Anway, Avenal (T), Berino, Bryman, Bucklebar, Chimenea (T), Cornville, Dona Ana, Garlock, Hap, Hi Vista, Madurez, Milham, Mohave, Neuralia, Palomas, Palo Verdes, Tijeras and Tres Hermanos series.  All of these have salt content less than 20 mmhos/cm and an SAR of less than 13. Also, Anway and Madurez have sola less than 20 inches thick.  Avenal soils have less than 35 percent total sand throughout.  Berino, Cornville, Hap and Mohave soils have a calcic horizon above a depth of 40 inches.  Bucklebar soils have a thin A2 surface horizon and have less than 15 percent gravel in the control section.  Chimenea soils are underlain by highly weathered granite at a depth of 6 to 20 inches.  Hi Vista soils have a lithic contact a depth of less than 40 inches.  Neuralia soils have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR in the argillic horizon.  Dona Ana and Tres Hermanos soils are calcareous throughout and thickness of sola is less than 34 inches.  Palomas soils are 36 to 50 inches deep to carbonates.  Tijeras soils have sola less than 34 inches thick.  Bryman soils have prismatic structure in the upper part of the B2t horizon.  With the exception of Avenal, Bryman, Garlock, Milham and Neuralia, the soil moisture control section of the competing series is intermittently moist in summer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mirage soils are on old stream terraces and have gradients of 2 to 5 percent.  They formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly form granitic sources.  Elevation ranges from 2,600 to 3,400 feet.  A well developed erosion pavement covers 70 to 90 percent of the surface.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, partly moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 or 6 inches, most of the moisture falls as rain in the winter.  Some moisture falls occasionally as snow.  The average January temperature is 46 degrees F; the average July temperature is 84 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F.  The frost free season is 210 to 255 days."

Cajon soils lack an argillic horizon and have a sandy control section.  Cuddeback soils have a duripan at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Joshua soils have a silica cementation in the C horizon.  Nebona soils have a duripan at a depth of less than 20 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Mirage soils could be classified as Salic Haplargids if an ammendment to the Soil Taxonomy establishing a salci subgroup is adopted.  They lack the structure required for a natric horizon.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 11/2015. The last revision to the series was 2/2003.
