  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to 90 inches.  Cracks up to 2 inches wide at the soil surface extend to 20 inches or more when the soil is dry and are 1/4 to 1/2 inch wide at 20 inches.  Coarse fragments range from a few scattered to 20 percent sandstone fragments to 3 inches in diameter in the lower B2t and B3t horizons.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 34 inches thick, and the amplitude of waviness of the lower boundary is about 6 to 12 inches.\nThe A horizon is dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2; 10YR 3/3, 4/3), brown (7.5YR 5/2), or dark grayish  brown (10YR 4/2).  It is loam or clay loam and ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons are brown (7.5YR 4/4, 5/2, 5/4), or dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 4/2; 10YR 4/3).  The Bt3 and Bt4 horizons are reddish brown (7.5YR 5/4), reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 4/4, 5,4), reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6, 6/8, 7/8), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).  Texture of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon is clay or clay loam.  Clay content is 35 to 50 percent.  Texture of the lower Bt horizon is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction of the Bt1 horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline, and the soil is moderately alkaline below the Bt1 horizon.  The BC horizons are strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), reddish yellow (7.5YR 6/6, 6/8, 7/8), pale brown (10YR 6/3), yellowish brown (10YR 5/6, 5/8), brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) or yellow (10YR 7/6, 7/8).  Secondary carbonates range from about 5 to 15 percent by volume in the Bky horizon.  A few to common selenite crystals occur in the lower Bky horizons.  Clayey marine shale fragments comprise from 5 to 30 percent of the volume of the lower BCky horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include Laparita series and the similar Clareville, Coy, Elmendorf, Luling and Topia soils.  Laparita soils have sola less than 60 inches thick and have higher salinity levels.  Clareville soils lack cracks 1/4 inch wide at 20 inches when dry.  Coy and Elmendorf soils have hues of 10YR or yellower throughout, and also have a greater amplitude of waviness of horizon thickness.  Topia soils have soil temperatures of less than 72 degrees F., Luling soils have intersecting slickensides."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marcelinas soils occur in level to gently sloping uplands with slope gradients ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Slopes are plane to convex.  The soil formed in calcareous, clayey and loamy materials generally containing thin strata of weakly cemented sandstone and clayey marine shale.  The climate is subhumid with an average annual rainfall of 27 to 36 inches, and an average annual air temperature of 70 to 73 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 31 to 44."
