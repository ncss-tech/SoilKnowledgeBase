  "OVERVIEW": "The Merimod series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils which are moderately deep to siliceous sand.  These soils formed in silty alluvium and in underlying loamy alluvium which is underlain by siliceous sandy alluvium on stream terraces and pediments. Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy alluvium, rapid in the sandy alluvium, and moderate to moderately rapid in the stratified sandy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the silty alluvium ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Depth to siliceous sandy alluvium ranges from 25 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay and 15 to 45 percent fine sand or coarser.  The sandy alluvium has less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the 0.02 - 2 mm fraction.  Typically, these soils have no coarse fragments but volume of sandstone gravel or channers ranges from 0 to 15 percent in individual subhorizons.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Redox features are within 72 inches and are commonly within 40 inches.  Saturation occurs at 40 to 72 inches for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.  Saturation occurs within 40 inches, in some pedons, but it is present less than 1 month per year or less than 6 out of 10 years, or both.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 3 or 4.\nThe 2Bt horizon has colors like the Bt horizon described above.  It is loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam. Loam or sandy loam layers have more than 17 percent clay or are transition layers less than 5 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a 3BC or 3Bt horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6.  Is is loamy sand or sand.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is sand or fine sand.  A few thin strata of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand are in the 3C horizon in some pedons."
