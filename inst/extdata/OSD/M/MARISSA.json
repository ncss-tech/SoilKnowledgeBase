  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Corley, Ebbert, Edgington, Knight, Normal, Speed, Thorp, and Vesser series. Corley, Ebbert, Normal, and Vesser soils do not have carbonates within the depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Edgington and Speed soils are more than 61 cm (24 inches) to the top of the argillic horizon. Knight soils have compete closely on soil properties and differentiae need to be more clearly defined. Typically, Knight soils are in cool, mesic regions and have lower mean annual air and soil temperatures, although currently the ranges overlap. Thorp soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower part of the series control section."
