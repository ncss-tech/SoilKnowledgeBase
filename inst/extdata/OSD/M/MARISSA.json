  "OVERVIEW": "The Marissa series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained or poorly drained soils formed in silty material on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).",

Corley, Ebbert, Normal, and Vesser soils do not have carbonates within the depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Edgington and Speed soils are more than 61 cm (24 inches) to the top of the argillic horizon. Knight soils have compete closely on soil properties and differentiae need to be more clearly defined. Typically, Knight soils are in cool, mesic regions and have lower mean annual air and soil temperatures, although currently the ranges overlap. Thorp soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower part of the series control section."
