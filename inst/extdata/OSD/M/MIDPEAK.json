These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon thickness is 7 to 15 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper 7 to 15 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.00 to 1.20 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section has 40 to 75 percent rock fragments and 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 4 or 5 dry, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 30 to 40 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hues of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, values of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam, very cobbly sandy loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  It has 30 to 55 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles."

The Bearspring, Cassal, Scoap, and Yellcreek soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock.  Frint soils have 18 to 25 percent clay.  Mineral soils are formed in granite and have coarse sandy loam textures in the 2C horizon.  Peahke soils have 18 to 30 percent clay.  Shalrock soils lack 5YR and 7.5YR hues in lower substratum.  Cherrycreek soils are deep to bedrock.  Eastpine soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and have a surface bulk density of 0.75 to 0.95 g/cc.  Longs soils are deep to bedrock.  Shilling soils are very deep."
