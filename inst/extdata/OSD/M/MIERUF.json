The soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section from late July through early October.  They are usually moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  Rock fragment content ranges 0 to 35 percent gravel throughout, with the larger amounts commonly in the uppermost horizons.  Base saturation (sum of cations) is 2 to 25 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4 or 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, or 4/4.  It is 3 to 7 inches thick.  It is gravelly or very gravelly loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 24 percent.  It is medium acid through strongly acid.  Organic matter content averages 5 to 10 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/6, 6/8; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/6, 6/8, 7/6; 5YR 4/6 or 5/6.
