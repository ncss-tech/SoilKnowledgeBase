  "OVERVIEW": "The Mill series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in till on Wisconsinan age plains and moraines. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the subsoil and moderately low in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1065 mm (42 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Aquic conditions - begin at the surface.\n3. Cambic horizon - from a depth of 28 to 102 cm (11 to 40 in) (Bg/E, Bw1, Bw2 and Bw3 horizons)\nThe 5YR and 7.5YR matrix hues of the BC and C horizons is generally associated with Keefus Till."
