Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Aquic conditions - begin at the surface.\n3. Cambic horizon - from a depth of 28 to 102 cm (11 to 40 in) (Bg/E, Bw1, Bw2 and Bw3 horizons)\nThe 5YR and 7.5YR matrix hues of the BC and C horizons is generally associated with Keefus Till.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to pedon AB-124 for characterization data on the typical pedon, sample numbers 26759 to 26773 from Ashtabula County, Ohio; samples analyzed by The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
