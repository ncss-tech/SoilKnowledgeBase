  "OVERVIEW": "The Mounthat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountains.  These soils formed in debris flow material weathered from andesite and ash.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
