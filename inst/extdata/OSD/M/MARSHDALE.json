  "OVERVIEW": "The Marshdale series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Marshdale soils are on flood plains and drainageways, and have slopes of 0 to 4 percent. Permeability is moderate. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

It was never mapped in Colorado, and South Dakota has only very limited acreage of this soil. The type location was transferred to Idaho in 1980. Idaho has about 20,000 acres of this soil.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nMollic epipedon - zone from the soil surface to approximately 47 inches (Ap, A, Bg1, and Bg2 horizons)\nSoils have aquic moisture regime\nSoils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth\nParticle - size control section - 10 to 40 inches (parts of A2, Bg1, and Bg2 horizon)"
