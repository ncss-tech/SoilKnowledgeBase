    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marshdale soils occur on nearly level bottomlands or gently sloping alluvial fans at elevations of 4,800 to 6,700 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The soils formed in alluvium from mixed sources. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains. The mean annual air temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 100 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brinegar, Hapur, Hutton, Picabo, and Strom soils. Brinegar soils have an argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained. Hapur soils are calcareous to the surface. Hutton soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the control section. Picabo soils are somewhat poorly drained. Strom soils have argillic horizons. Brinegar and Picabo soils occur on stream terraces. Hapur, Hutton, and Strom soils occur in bottomlands and on flood plains."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series type location was originally in Colorado. It was established in South Dakota in the South Meade County Survey. It was never mapped in Colorado, and South Dakota has only very limited acreage of this soil. The type location was transferred to Idaho in 1980. Idaho has about 20,000 acres of this soil.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:\nMollic epipedon - zone from the soil surface to approximately 47 inches (Ap, A, Bg1, and Bg2 horizons)\nSoils have aquic moisture regime\nSoils have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth\nParticle - size control section - 10 to 40 inches (parts of A2, Bg1, and Bg2 horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
