The native vegetation in excellent condition is composed of 90 percent grasses, 5 percent woody plants, and 5 percent forbs. In excellent condition, mid grasses dominate; blackbrush and lotebush are dominant woody plants; the major forbs are velvet bundleflower, orange zexmenia and bushsunflower. As retrogression occurs, woody plants, especially blackbrush, increase in density. Grasses which increase or invade are red grama, Hall's panicum, threeawns, and Texas bristlegrass.

Selected analyses of two satellite pedons were also determined by NSSL; Lab Sample Nos. 80-903 to 80-908. Particle size analysis was performed at the local project office for 4 pedons from Duval County. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from Webb County, Texas.
