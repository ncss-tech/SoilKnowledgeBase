  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Fragments of shale, siltstone or sandstone, mostly channers, range from 5 to 30 percent in the solum and 35 to 80 percent in the C horizon. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the profile, except the upper layers where limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. An E horizon is present in many pedons and has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Fine-earth texture of the A and E horizons is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Fine-earth texture is silt loam or loam. A few faint clay films are present in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has colors and textures similar to the lower B horizon. Lithochromic mottles in shades of brown, yellow, red or gray are common in some pedons. A Cr horizon is present in many pedons and is more common in areas of shale or siltstone bedrock.\nThe R horizon is commonly hard sandstone, siltstone, or shale but grades to a more fractured and rippable condition in some areas."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ayersville and Citico series. Ayersville soils formed in residuum weathered from Triassic aged siltstone, mudstone, and shale. Citico soils formed in colluvium weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite, slate, and slightly metamorphosed shale, siltstone or sandstone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Muskingum soils are in rugged topography on dissected plateaus. Slopes range from 2 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded shale, siltstone and sandstone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 55 inches and mean annual air temperatures from 50 to 57 degrees F."

Dekalb, Lehew, Petros and Sharondale soils are loamy-skeletal. Gilpin, Jefferson and Lily soils are fine-loamy and they have argillic horizons. Marrowbone soils are coarse-loamy. Ramsey soils are loamy.  Kimper soils have umbric surface horizons and Sharondale soils have mollic surface horizons. Petros and Ramsey soils are less than 20 inches deep over bedrock. Jefferson, Kimper and Sharondale soils are more than 40 inches deep over bedrock. Dekalb, Jefferson, Lehew and Lily soils have siliceous mineralogy."
