  "OVERVIEW": "The Modena series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks. Modena soils occur on alluvial fans and floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 56 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 65 to 72 degrees F. These soils are dry more than 1/2 of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but are continually moist 25 to 30 percent of the time. The organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth.\nThin A horizons have developed where the soils are under irrigation; where present, they have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. They have weak granular and platy structure. The A horizon is mildly through strongly alkaline. It is O to 9 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has a hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. The C horizon is mildly through strongly alkaline. It is usually massive but in some pedons has weak granular or subangular blocky structure. This horizon is stratified but is dominantly sandy loam and fine sandy loam. In some pedons, up to 15 percent gravel occurs in thin lenses above a depth of 40 inches and 0 to 70 percent gravel occurs below 40 inches. In some pedons, strata of silt loam and silty clay loam occur below 40 inches."

These soils formed in alluvium from mixed sedimentary and igneous parent material. The climate is semiarid. The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 66 to 73 degrees F., and the freeze-free period ranges from 115 to 145 days."
