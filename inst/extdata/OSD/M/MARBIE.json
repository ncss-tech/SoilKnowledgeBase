  "OVERVIEW": "The Marbie series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils along drainageways, on toeslopes, and in depressions.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium weathered dominantly from limestone with inclusions of shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone over residuum. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 55 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",

Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 8.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.
