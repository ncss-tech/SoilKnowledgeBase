Rock fragments of chert, shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and Bt horizons, 0 to 35 percent in the Btx horizon, and 0 to 25 percent in the 2Bt and 2C horizons.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 8.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It ranges from loam through clay in the fine-earth fraction."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marbie soils formed in colluvial and alluvial materials weathered dominantly from limestone with inclusions of shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone over residuum in limestone valleys.  Marbie soils are in nearly level to moderately steep concave upland drainageways, toeslopes, sinks, and saddles in the Ridge and Valley province.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 55 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches."

Austinville, Chiswell, Frederick, Groseclose, and Litz soils do not have fragipans and are on convex ridgetops and sideslopes.  Timberville and Wyrick soils do not have fragipans and occur on similar landscape positions.  Wurno soils are shallower to bedrock and are on convex ridgetops and sideslopes."
