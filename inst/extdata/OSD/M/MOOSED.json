  "OVERVIEW": "The Moosed series consists of very shallow and shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone.  Moosed soils are on plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
