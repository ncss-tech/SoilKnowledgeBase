  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Milford soils are on low broad summits or in depressions on glacial lake plains thought to be of Wisconsin Age. They formed in lacustrine sediments. Some areas have a thin mantle of outwash overlying the lacustrine sediments. Slope gradients commonly are less than 1 percent, but the range is 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 53 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 1016 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 155 to 305 meters (510 to 1,000 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Catlin, Markham, Morley, and Ozaukee soils and the somewhat poorly drained Beecher, Del Rey, Elliott, Flanagan, Martinton, and Swygert soils are on higher elevations or are more sloping, or both. The poorly drained Bryce, Drummer, and Selma soils are on similar landscape positions nearby. The Bryce soils have a 2B horizon in till and do not have strata in the lower part of the solum. The Drummer soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Selma soils are fine-loamy."

The apparent seasonal high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the soil surface to 31 cm (1.0 foot) below the surface at some time during the spring in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/s). Permeability is moderately slow."

A till substratum phase has been recognized for pedons underlain by till within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). These phases will be evaluated during MLRA update activities to determine if new series need to be established.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon 0 to 56 cm (0 to 22 inches) (Ap, A, and BA horizons); cambic horizon 56 to 127 cm (22 to 50 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, and Bg3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: For laboratory analyses refer to Illinois Nos. 18495-18501.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
