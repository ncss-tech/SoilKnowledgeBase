The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is silt loam or loam in the upper 20 inches and sandy loam, loam or silt loam below this depth.  It has an average of 10 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The solum is 21 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is 12 to 18 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid through slightly acid.  It is 7 to 10 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or silt loam and averages 12 to 18 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is stratified sandy loam, loam, and silt loam.  Loamy sand commonly is below 60 inches.  It averages 8 to 18 percent clay above the loamy sand horizon.  It is very strongly acid through moderately acid."
