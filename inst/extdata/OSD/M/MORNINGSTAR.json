  "OVERVIEW": "The Morningstar series consists of very deep, well drained soils on forested areas.  They formed in colluvium weathered from argillite and rhyolitic tuffs and breccias.  Slopes are 12 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
