The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to over 60 inches.  Depth to the Bt horizon is 10 to 20 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 40 to 80 percent in the control section.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  The solum ranges from neutral to slightly acid and is less than 50 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 55 to 65 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam or loam, averaging 25 to 35 percent clay and 40 to 60 percent sand.  It has 50 to 60 percent gravel and 5 to 20\npercent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

Fergie soils are dry 90 to 120 days during the summer and do not have O horizons. Fraval soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Henhoit soils have solums thicker than 50 inches.  Sattleg soils are dry for more than 80 consecutive days during the summer.  Little Wood soils are less than 34 inches deep to the base of the argillic."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered mainly from argillite and\nrhyolitic tuffs and breccias.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
