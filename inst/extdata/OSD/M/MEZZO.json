  "OVERVIEW": "The Mezzo series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian deposits derived from sandstone.  Mezzo soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
