  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Manahaa soils are on upper elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai and Mauna Loa volcanoes at elevations from 1067 to 1768 meters (3,500 to 5,800 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of nearly level to very steep pahoehoe lava flows that are 5,000 to 10,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over pahoehoe lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 1780 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
