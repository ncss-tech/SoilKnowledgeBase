  "OVERVIEW": "The Mosher series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium on flood plains, terraces, and uplands.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent slopes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonate typically ranges from 15 to 35 inches, but some pedons have carbonate at the surface.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches or more and it extends into the Bt horizon.  The natric horizon has ESP or SAR of 10 to 20.  Accumulations of salts are below depths of 16 inches and are typically in the lower Bt horizon or Bk horizon.  The soil particle size control section contains more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 1 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon commonly is silt loam but in some pedons it is loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam.  The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon commonly is silt loam but is loam or very fine sandy loam in some pedons.  It has value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It ranges from moderately acid or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay.  It has value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bkz horizon is silty clay loam or clay loam but is clay in some pedons.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bkyz horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, silty clay, clay or sandy clay loam and is commonly stratified with layers of loamy fine sand to clay.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have buried horizons below 40 inches."
