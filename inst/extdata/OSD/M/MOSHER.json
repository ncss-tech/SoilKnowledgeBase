  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonate typically ranges from 15 to 35 inches, but some pedons have carbonate at the surface.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches or more and it extends into the Bt horizon.  The natric horizon has ESP or SAR of 10 to 20.  Accumulations of salts are below depths of 16 inches and are typically in the lower Bt horizon or Bk horizon.  The soil particle size control section contains more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and less than 1 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon commonly is silt loam but in some pedons it is loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam.  The A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon commonly is silt loam but is loam or very fine sandy loam in some pedons.  It has value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It ranges from moderately acid or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam averaging between 35 and 60 percent clay.  It has value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bkz horizon is silty clay loam or clay loam but is clay in some pedons.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bkyz horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, silty clay, clay or sandy clay loam and is commonly stratified with layers of loamy fine sand to clay.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have buried horizons below 40 inches."

In addition, DeGrey soils contain less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  Dwight soils are less alkaline, underlain by limestone and have a warmer soil temperature control section.  Farmsworth soils contain less than 15 percent fine sand and more coarser.  Wood River soils have a warmer soil temperture control section  and mean annual air temperature greater than 49 degrees F."

Slope gradients typically are less than 3 percent but range up to 6 percent. Microrelief commonly is evident.  Mosher soils formed in loamy alluvium.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 12 to 24 inches.  Growing season ranges from 125 to 160 days; growing season precipitation is about 11 to 17 inches; growing season degree days range from 2600 to 3300."
