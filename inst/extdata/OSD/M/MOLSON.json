    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Molson soils formed from glacial till of mixed mineralogy with a mantle of volcanic ash. The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. The frost free season is 95 to 130 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Molson soils are associated with the Chesaw, Hunters, Koepke, Mires and Republic soils. Chesaw soils are sandy-skeletal and are on terraces, terrace escarpments and eskers. Hunters soils are fine-silty and are on terraces. Koepke soils have a mollic epipedon over 20 inches thick and are on footslopes and backslopes of glaciated hills and mountains and are forested. Mires soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on terraces. Republic soils are coarse-loamy and are on alluvial fans, terraces, footslopes and backslopes of mountains."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon  - the zone from 0 to 18 inches (Ap and A horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 42 inches (2Bw horizon)\nAndic soil properties - the zone from 0 to 18 inches (Ap and A horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 0 to 40 inches (Ap, A, 2Bw, and part of the 2BC horizon)\nDensic contact -50 inches\nPermeability rate of the till material needs review as it is typically considered to be slow or very slow.\nThis series was previously classified as medial over loamy, mixed, frigid Mollic Vitrandepts. In 2001 it was reclassified to to ashy over loamy, glassy over mixed, superactive, frigid Humic Vitrixerands.\nThis series along with associated Humic Vitrixerands in 43A in Washington need analysis for andic soil properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
