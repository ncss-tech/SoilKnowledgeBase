  "OVERVIEW": "The Molson series consists of deep to densic material, well drained, soils on footslopes and backslopes of glaciated hills and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. They formed in a mantle of volcanic ash over glacial till of mixed mineralogy. The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

Chesaw soils are sandy-skeletal and are on terraces, terrace escarpments and eskers. Hunters soils are fine-silty and are on terraces. Koepke soils have a mollic epipedon over 20 inches thick and are on footslopes and backslopes of glaciated hills and mountains and are forested. Mires soils are ashy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are on terraces. Republic soils are coarse-loamy and are on alluvial fans, terraces, footslopes and backslopes of mountains."

In 2001 it was reclassified to to ashy over loamy, glassy over mixed, superactive, frigid Humic Vitrixerands.\nThis series along with associated Humic Vitrixerands in 43A in Washington need analysis for andic soil properties."
