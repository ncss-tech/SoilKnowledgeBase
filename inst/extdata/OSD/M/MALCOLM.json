Ashdale soils formed in thinner loess; the lower part of the solum formed in residuum weathered from limestone and limestone bedrock is at depths of 3 to 5 feet.\nBroadwell, Catlin, Plano, Proctor, Richwood, Sidell, and Toddville soils all have more sand in their lower sola.  Cotter, Sibley, and Troxel soils have thicker mollic epipedons.\nDinsdale soils have loam or clay loam glacial till within a depth of 40 inches.\nDouglas soils have lower base saturation in the B horizon.  Elmont soils have more clay in the lower part of the B horizon and C horizons of weathered shale.\nHealing soils typically have redder B horizons and contain pebbles in the lower B and C horizons.\nLycurgus, Meadowbank, Tecumseh and Wakenda soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick and are in an area with higher precipitation.\nMendota soils have glacial till within a depth of 40 inches.  Ogle soils have a lower solum formed in glacial till.  Ripon soils have limestone bedrock within 40 inches.\nWaupecan soils have a drier control section and formed in sandy and gravelly outwash.\nWiota soils have thicker mollic epipedons and contain more clay in the C horizons."
