Slopes are dominantly 6 to 12 percent but range from 2 to 40 percent. The soils formed in a thin mantle of organic material and volcanic ash overlying `a`a lava. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,524 to 3,048 millimeters (60 to 120 inches). The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1,270 to 1,905 millimeters (50 to 75 inches).
