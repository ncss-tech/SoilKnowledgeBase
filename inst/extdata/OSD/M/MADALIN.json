Arkport and Dunkirk soils formed in silty to fine sand deltaic deposits. Bath, Danley, Honeoye, Langford, Lansing, and Ontario soils formed in till. Howard and Palmyra soils formed in glacial outwash. Hudson soils formed in materials similar to that of Madalin soils but are moderately well drained. Rhinebeck soils formed in similar materials but are somewhat poorly drained. Fonda soils lack an argillic horizon and have more than 10 percent organic matter in the A horizon."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series was previously defined as poorly and very poorly drained. The very poorly was removed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon (NASIS User Pedon ID 77NY073003) include:\n1. Mollic subgroup - meets the requirements for mollic epipedon, except thickness, after mixing the upper 18cm where the Ap horizon is less than 25 cm thick and the lower boundary of the argillic horizon is below 75 cm.\n2. Argillic horizon - from 20 to 84 cm (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3 horizons).\n3. Endoaqualfs great group - Endosaturation from 20 cm (Btg1 horizon) to more than 200 cm.\n4. Aquic moisture regime as evidenced by redoximorphic features in all layers between 25 cm and 40 cm, and within the upper 12.5 cm of the argillic horizon, more than 50% redox depletions with a chroma of 2 or less on faces of peds (reduced matrix in all subsurface horizons), and redox concentrations within peds.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
