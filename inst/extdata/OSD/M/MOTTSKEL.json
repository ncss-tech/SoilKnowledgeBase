    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mottskel soils are on alluvial fans.  They formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,425 to 2,015 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
