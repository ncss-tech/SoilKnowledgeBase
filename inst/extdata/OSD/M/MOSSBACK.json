  "OVERVIEW": "The Mossback series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy till overlying sandy glaciofluvial deposits on end moraines and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
