  "OVERVIEW": "The Mountom series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in hydrophytic plant material over alluvium from mixed rock sources. Mountom soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 16.1 degrees C.",

Organic layers\na. Surface tier 0 to 30 cm - 75% identifiable plant\nparts and bulk density 0.1 -0.2 g/cm3.\nb. Subsurface tier 30 to 64 cm - 25% identifiable\nplant parts.\nc. Pyrophosphate extractable color assumed to have value\nless than 7 based on similar Medihemist soils in other\nareas.\nd. The pH in .01 CaCl is >4.5 throughout the O horizon.\n2. Mineral layers fall within the control section of 0 to 130 cm.\na. The portion of the control section between 64 and 130 cm (the lower part of the subsurface tier and all\nof the bottom tier) is mineral soil and averages about\n10% clay and 23% gravel (loamy).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
