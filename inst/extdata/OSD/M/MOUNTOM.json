The MAAT would suggest thermic, but the MAST averages mesic due to the cooling effect of the high water table.\nDiagnostic horizons and other soil properties recognized in the profile are:\nHistic epipedon: Zone from the 0 to 64 cm (Oe1, Oe2, Oe3, Oa)\n1. Organic layers\na. Surface tier 0 to 30 cm - 75% identifiable plant\nparts and bulk density 0.1 -0.2 g/cm3.\nb. Subsurface tier 30 to 64 cm - 25% identifiable\nplant parts.\nc. Pyrophosphate extractable color assumed to have value\nless than 7 based on similar Medihemist soils in other\nareas.\nd. The pH in .01 CaCl is >4.5 throughout the O horizon.\n2.
