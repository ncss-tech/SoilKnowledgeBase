  "OVERVIEW": "The Mayswell series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils on hills and mountains.  These soils formed in alluvium over residuum from basalt and rhyolite.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
