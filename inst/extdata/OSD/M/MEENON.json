Depth to the sandy substratum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle and from 0 to 2 percent in the clayey lacustrine deposits and in the sandy substratum.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the sandy mantle and from extremely acid to slightly alkaline in the clayey subsoil.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly  acid in the sandy substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy sand.\nUncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe 2Bt or 2Btg horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The weighted average clay content is 50 to 80 percent.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Texture is sand or fine sand, but some pedons have thin strata of loamy sand or sandy loam."

Meenon soils formed in a mantle of sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits over clayey lacustrine deposits underlain by sandy outwash or sandy lacustrine deposits on  lake plains or outwash plains.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 29 inches.  The frost free period ranges from about 110 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 960 to 1,100 feet."

The very poorly drained Dody(T), and the moderately well drained Karlsborg(T) soils form a drainage sequence with the Meenon soils.  The moderately well drained Perida(T) soils occupy  slightly higher landscape positions and the somewhat poorly drained Stengel (T) soil occupy similar landscape positions than Meenon soils, but  the sandy mantle is more than 40 inches thick."

Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, slow or very slow in the clayey deposits, and rapid in the sandy substratum.  These soils have a perched seasonal high water table for at a depth of 1.5 to 2.5 feet at some time during the period September to May in most years."
