  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mescal soils are developed under a continental climate with an average annual precipitation of about 13 inches. March, April, May, June, October and November are the driest months, each with less than 1 inch per month. January average temperature is about 41 degrees F., July average about 78 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. The average frost-free period is about 200 days. These soils occupy gently rolling uplands (5-25 percent slopes) at an elevation of about 4,000 feet."

Karro and Penthouse soils are very deep and have calcic horizons. Retriever soils are shallow and have carbonatic mineralogy. Stagecoach soils have redder color, lack cobbles and are from more uniform parent material."
