Copenhaver and Nieman soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Donkehill soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates and are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Hogmalat soils average 35 to 55 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have mean summer soil temperature of 54 to 57 degrees F.  Layview soils have lithic contacts that are within 14 inches of the soil surface and average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Maygal soils have mean summer soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F.  Mosroc soils have mean summer soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F., have less than 60 percent rock in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Nielsen soils have mean summer soil temperature of 55 to 59 degrees F., are dominated by channers, and have rock fragments that are sandstone or quartzite.  Notstew soils have lithic contacts that are within 14 inches of the soil surface, average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, and have mean summer soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mountpatterson soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder positions.  They formed in volcanic ash and in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, tuff, or metavolcanic rocks.   Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 10,000 to 11,600 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches, the mean annual temperature is 33 to 38 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
