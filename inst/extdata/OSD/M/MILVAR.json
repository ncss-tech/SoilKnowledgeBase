  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the nonlimiting very gravelly loamy sand substrata ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  Bedrock occurs at depths greater than 60 inches.  EC is less than 2 mmhos throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Coarse fragments are variable but range from 10 to 40 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 1 to 5 percent stones.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nAn AB or BA horizon is present in some pedons and has similar properties of both the A or Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Matrix texture is heavy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay with 35 to 60 percent clay and from 10 to 35 percent coarse fragments, mainly pebbles with a few cobbles.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has similar properties to the Bt horizon except for the pedogenetic lime accumulation occurring as common seams and pendants on rock fragments.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is typically very gravelly loam but is very gravelly sandy loam in some pedons.  Clay ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 60 percent and include mainly pebbles with 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges form 15 to 30 percent and occurs as many large masses, seams, and as moderately thick pendants on rock fragments.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is typically very gravelly loamy sand and less commonly very gravelly loamy fine sand.  Clay ranges from 3 to 10 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 35 to 60 percent, which are mainly pebbles and include 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Calcium carbonates range from 5 to 10 percent and are mainly disseminated with a few soft masses or seams.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Milvar soils are on relict terraces, outwash plains, and mountain toeslopes.  These soils formed in old alluvium derived dominantly from mixed sources.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations are 6,700 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  About half falls as snow and less commonly rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees and ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F.  The estimated frost-free season ranges from 90 to 120 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and local air drainage."
