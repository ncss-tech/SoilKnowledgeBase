    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Midas soils are on toe slopes of alluvial fans. Elevations are 1,370 to 1,495 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in silty alluvium and loess with moderate amounts of pyroclastic material over mixed very gravelly loamy and sandy alluvium.  The average annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C.; average annual precipitation is 175 to 200 mm; and frost-free season is about l00 to l05 days."
