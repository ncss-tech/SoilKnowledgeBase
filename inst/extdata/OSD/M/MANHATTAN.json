  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Manhattan series includes Brown soils developed in fine-sandy lacustrine deposits. The original material consisted of wind-blown fine or very fine sand which fell into a former lake, forming what is known as the Bozeman Lake Beds. These soils differ from those of the Amsterdam series in having less silt in their composition. They resemble Greeley soils but are on old lake beds and high alluvial colluvial benches instead of stream terraces. Their parent materials have been reworked more by wind than have those of the Greeley soils.",
