  "OVERVIEW": "The Milarch series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on lake plains and deltas. They formed in loamy lacustrine deposits and the underlying sandy lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
