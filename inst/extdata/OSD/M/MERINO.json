  "OVERVIEW": "The Merino series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium derived from quartz-monzonite and other granitic rocks.  Merino soils are on mountain slopes.  Slope ranges from 10 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

(R horizon)\nCryic soil moisture regime.\nStopped here\nTaxonomic Version: Classified according to the Keys of Soil Taxonomy, 10th Edition, 2006.\nColorado assumed responsibility from Montana for the series in May, 1993.\nA cambic horizon was recognized in this soil and the classification changed from nonacid Lithic Cryorthents to superactive Lithic Eutrocryepts in February 1999.\nThe concept was narrowed to the ustic udic moisture regime. The elevation, MLRA, and the precipitation were also narrowed.
