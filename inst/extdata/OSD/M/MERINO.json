(R horizon)\nCryic soil moisture regime.\nStopped here\nTaxonomic Version: Classified according to the Keys of Soil Taxonomy, 10th Edition, 2006.\nColorado assumed responsibility from Montana for the series in May, 1993.\nA cambic horizon was recognized in this soil and the classification changed from nonacid Lithic Cryorthents to superactive Lithic Eutrocryepts in February 1999.\nThe concept was narrowed to the ustic udic moisture regime. The elevation, MLRA, and the precipitation were also narrowed.
