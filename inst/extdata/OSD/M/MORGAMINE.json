These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from dacite tuff.  The mean annual precipitation is 23 to 25 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F.  The frost free period is 140 to 180 days."
