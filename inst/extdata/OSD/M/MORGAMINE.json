  "OVERVIEW": "The Morgamine series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from dacite tuff.  Morgamine soils are on mountain side slopes.  Slopes range from 55 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
