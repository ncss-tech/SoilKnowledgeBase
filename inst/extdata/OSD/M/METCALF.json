Abita and Glenmora soils do not have a discontinuity to Tertiary materials, and have are in an active activity class. Bernaldo, Evangeline, Frizzell, Keithville and Scottville soils do not have a glossic horizon. In addition, Scottsville soils have an abrupt textural change at the discontinuity. Fred soils have mixed mineralogy. Hicota and Wanilla soils are coarse-loamy in the control section. Messer and Tippo soils are coarse-silty in the control section. Pooleville soils do not have a clayey discontinuity. Raino and Scottsville soils have an abrupt textural change within the control section. Rodessa soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Timpson soils are coarse-silty in the control section and are 45 to 60 inches to the clayey discontinuity."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was updated in 2002 to allow the glossic horizon to begin at the top of the argillic horizon in some pedons. The classification was changed in October, 2004 from and Aquic Glossudalf to a Glossaquic Paleudalf due to a change in 9th ed. Keys to Taxonomy which places Paleudalfs higher on the key than Glossudalfs.  Paleudalfs now may have a Glossic horizon.  Diagnostic and other features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon.............the zone from 0 to 8 inches deep (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon............the zone from 8 to 65 inches deep (Bt, Bt/E and Btg horizons)\nGlossic horizon.............the zone from 30 to 38 inches deep (Bt/E horizon)\nLithologic discontinuity....at 38 inches deep (top of the 2Btg1 horizon)"
