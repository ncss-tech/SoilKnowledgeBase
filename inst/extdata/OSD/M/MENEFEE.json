  "OVERVIEW": "The Menefee series consists very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from shale.  Menefee soils are on hillslopes, mesas, breaks and mountainsides.  Slope ranges from 2 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 8.9 degrees C.",

Laboratory data is needed to verify carbonate content.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
