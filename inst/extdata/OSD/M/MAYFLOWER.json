  "OVERVIEW": "The Mayflower series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from sandstone, siltstone and shale. They are on hills, ridges, stream terraces, and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
