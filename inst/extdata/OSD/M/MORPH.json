    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum ranges from 19 to 50 inches.  Free carbonates begin at depths below 22 inches.  In the argillic horizon, average clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent, but subhorizons in some pedons have as much as 40 percent; content of fine and coarser sands ranges from 15 to 60 percent.  Some pedons have as much as 3 percent by volume of fine gravel.\nSome pedons have an 0 horizon as much as 3 inches thick consisting mainly of leaves and twigs.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or is neutral having value of 2.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has few to many high chroma mottles.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E/B horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has high chroma mottling.  It has average texture of loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, clay loam or silt loam, but may have thin strata with more or less clay.  In some pedons, the Bt horizon consists of lamellae separated by sandy strata.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 2 or 1.  It has high chroma mottling.  It is stratified with textures loamy sand to silty clay loam, but averaging less than 27 percent clay.  It has disseminated free carbonates in most pedons, some pedons have soft rounded masses or threadlike carbonate concentrations, a few are leached in the upper part.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Dancy series in this family.  Other soils in closely related families are the Blomford, Chilgren, Cowhorn, Freer, Sandwick, Shooker, and Spooner series.  Dancy soils are deeper to carbonates and formed in till with more coarse fragments.  The Blomford and Sandwick series have sandy epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick; the Sandwick series also is a bisequum.  The Chilgren and Shooker series formed in loamy, calcareous glacial till with higher content of coarse fragments.  The Cowhorn series formed in sediments that are primarily very fine sand and lack an argillic horizon.  The Freer series formed in 15 to 30 inches of silty mantle and underlying acid reddish brown, dense, loamy glacial till.  The Spooner soils formed predominantly in silty calcareous sediments and have a fine-silty argillic horizon."

They formed in sediments more than 40 inches thick that are predominantly loamy, but have significant sandy stratification.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees to 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 23 to 28 inches."

The very poorly drained Cathro, Greenwood, Lupton, and Mooselake soils formed dominantly in organic materials in depressions.  The moderately well drained Rosy series and the depressional, very poorly drained Sago series are hydrosequence associates.  The poorly drained Spooner soils are intermingled and on nearby landscapes."
