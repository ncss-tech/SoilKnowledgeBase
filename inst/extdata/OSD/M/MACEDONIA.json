  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than l00 inches.  Rock fragments larger than 3 inches are less than 5 percent within the particle-size control section and 5 to l0 percent below.  Gravel content is usually less than l5 percent in the particle size control section, but can have individual horizons that range to 25 percent.  Below the particle size control section the rock fragment content ranges up to 50 percent.  Approximately 75 percent of the chert content is l/4 inch to 3 inches in size.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to extremely acid with acidity increasing with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has a hue of l0YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Gravel content is 0 to 35 percent.\nThe E horizon has a hue of l0YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture in the A horizon is silt loam or gravelly silt loam. Gravel content is 0 to 35 percent.\nThe BA, AB, or Bt horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam, gravelly silt loam, gravelly silty clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has l0YR or 7.5YR and rarely 5YR and 2.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay in the upper part and silty clay or clay in the lower part, but gravelly textures are within the range.  Most pedons have mottles in the lower part of the B2t that are either redder or grayer than the matrix color."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Macedonia soils are on ridgetops and side slopes. Slope gradients range from 2 to l5 percent.  In most places they occupy fairly broad ridges above very cherty soils on steep slopes.  The soils formed in a thin layer of loess or silty slope alluvium and the underlying residuum from clayey shales and cherty dolomite or cherty limestone."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Captina, Clarksville, Coulstone, Doniphan, Lebanon, Poynor, Viraton, and Wilderness soils.  The high rock fragment content of their upper solums distinguishes Clarksville, Coulstone, Doniphan, and Poynor soils from the Macedonia soils.  These cherty soils are on steeper slopes or narrow ridgetops.  A fragipan distinguishes the Captina, Lebanon, Viraton, and Wilderness soils from the Macedonia soils.  These soils are on the wider ridgetops generally upslope from the Macedonia soils."
