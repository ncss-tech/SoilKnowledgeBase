Depth to accumulations of calcium carbonate is typically 13 to 20 inches, but ranges to 34 inches in some pedons.  It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments throughout.  Electrical conductivity is 0 to 4 millimhos per centimeter.  The moisture control section is usually moist in some or all parts in March through June.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam or silt loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have an AB horizon up to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7,5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay or clay.  It has 35 to 50 percent clay and 10 to 30 percent fine and coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moorhead soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, plateaus, terraces, valley fill positions, hills and ridges.  They formed in alluvium derived primarily from shale.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
