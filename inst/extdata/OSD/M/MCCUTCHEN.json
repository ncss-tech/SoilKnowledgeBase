Kaito soils have bedrock at 100 to 150 cm. Kinan, Moffat and Nakai soils have hues redder than 10YR and lack pyroclastic materials. Nuahs soils have a depth of 5 to 30 cm to the top of the calcic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McCutchen soils are on toe slopes of alluvial fans near or adjacent to playas.  They have developed in alluvium derived mainly from ignimbrite, and have been influenced by precipitation of carbonate in the lower horizons when the playas contained water.  These soils are at elevations of 1,370 to 1,585 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm.  The mean annual air temperature is10 to 13 degrees C and the frost-free period 130 to 150 days."
