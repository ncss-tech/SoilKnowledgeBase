  "OVERVIEW": "The McCutchen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from ignimbrite with an influence of carbonates from ground water. McCutchen soils are on toe slopes of fan remnants and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 175 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

They have developed in alluvium derived mainly from ignimbrite, and have been influenced by precipitation of carbonate in the lower horizons when the playas contained water.  These soils are at elevations of 1,370 to 1,585 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm.  The mean annual air temperature is10 to 13 degrees C and the frost-free period 130 to 150 days."
