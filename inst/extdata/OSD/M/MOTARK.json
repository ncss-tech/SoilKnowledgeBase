  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Motark series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in silty alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 53 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 33 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has color value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Pedons that have thin strata of very dark brown (10YR 2/2), very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or dark brown (10YR 3/3) are within the range of the series if they are in a sequence of stratified sediments and not surface layers of buried soils. Iron stains and masses are mostly on the faces of bedding planes and are few to common increasing in the Cg horizon. They have hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8. The C horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline. Texture of the C horizon is dominantly silt loam with less than 18 percent clay but some pedons have thin strata of silty clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Motark soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains of tributary streams that flow across the slack water areas of flood plains of larger rivers and on narrow flood plains of tributary streams in uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in noncalcareous silty alluvium from soils formed in loess. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 49 to 55 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dockery, Dupo, Luton, Napier and Wabash soils. Dockery soils are on slightly lower elevations. Dupo soils are slightly lower in elevation and are clayey in the lower part. Luton and Wabash soils are lower in elevation, have more clay throughout and are poorly or very poorly drained. Napier soils are on foot slopes and alluvial fans, have very thick dark surface layers and are well drained."
