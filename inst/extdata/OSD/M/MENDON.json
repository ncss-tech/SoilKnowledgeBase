  "OVERVIEW": "The Mendon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in light colored tuff, conglomerate, tuffaceous sandstone and limestone. The Memdon soils are on gently sloping lake terraces and moderately steep rolling dissected foothills.  Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 degrees to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 65 degrees to 68 degrees F. The soil is usually moist, but it is dry for 60 consecutive days in the 4-to 12-inch depth in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 32 inches in thickness, and commonly includes all of the A and B horizons.  Depth to carbonates is 20 to 32 inches.  The ratio of cation exchange capacity to clay is 0.7 to 0.9.\nThe A horizon has hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 dry and 1 through 3 moist, and chroma is between 1 and 1.5.  It has weak fine to medium granular or subangular blocky structure. It ranges from neutral to slightly alkaline and is usually noncalcareous, but in some pedons it is slightly calcareous due to recent deposition or rodent activity.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam, and contains less than 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It has moderate medium subangular blocky structure or moderate medium prismatic structure.  It has thin to moderately thick common to continuous clay films.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe layer of calcium carbonate accumulation extends from the lower part of the B horizon into the upper part of the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or lOYR, value of 7 or 8 dry and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma is 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  It is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline, and strongly to very strongly calcareous."

Bothwell soils have chroma of 2 or more in the A horizon and are calcareous in the argillic horizons.  Parleys soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and chroma of 2 or more in the A horizon.  Squaw soils have chroma of 2 or more in the A horizons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes gradients are 0 to 20 percent.  The soil formed in light colored tuff, conglomerate, tuffaceous sandstone and limestone. The climate is moist subhumid.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 18 inches, mean annual temperature 45 degrees to 48 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 65 degrees to 70 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 120 to 150 days."

Wheelon soils, in addition, lack mollic epipedons. Crookstown soils have loam argillic horizons that contain more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand."
