  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Molen series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian sands and colluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from interbedded shale and sandstone.  Molen soils are on cuestas, structural benches, and escarpments on edges of mesas.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C.",
