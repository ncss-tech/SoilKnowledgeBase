    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Depth to bedrock or unconforming substrata is more than 60 inches. The soil ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BAg horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Some pedons have a clay loam texture in the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon has a range for color and texture the same as that given for the Bt horizon.  Gravel or cobble-size rock fragments make up 0 to 15 percent of the C horizon of some pedons."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Toms and Tygart soils, these are the well drained Berks, Gilpin, and Weikert soils on nearby uplands and the Allegheny, Cotaco, and Monongahela soils on adjacent terraces.  Except for Tygart and Toms, all of these soils have less clay and less gray colors throughout than Maurertown soils. In addition, Berks and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock and have more rock fragments, and Monongahela soils have a fragipan."
