  "OVERVIEW": "The Mantlemine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from interbedded limestone and sandstone.  Mantlemine soils are on structural benches, alluvial fans, and fan remnants.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
