  "OVERVIEW": "The Megwil series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in marine deposits derived from mixed sources.  Megwil soils are on nearly level to gently sloping, dissected marine terraces and have slopes 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",

Elevations are 4 to 183 meters (10 to 600 feet). These soils form in marine deposits derived from mixed sources. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2085 millimeters (35 to 90 inches). Mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F). Frost free season is about 275 to 325 days."
