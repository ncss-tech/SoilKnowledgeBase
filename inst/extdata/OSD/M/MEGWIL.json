  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Megwil soils are on nearly level to gently sloping, slightly dissected marine terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Elevations are 4 to 183 meters (10 to 600 feet). These soils form in marine deposits derived from mixed sources. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2085 millimeters (35 to 90 inches). Mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F). Frost free season is about 275 to 325 days."

Timmons soils lack redoximorphic features within the upper 100 centimeters. Cannonball soils occur under mixed conifer forest of Sitka-spruce and redwood, where the difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperatures is less than 6 degrees C."
