  "OVERVIEW": "The Marblecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils on mountains.  They formed in material weathered from schist and quartzite bedrock with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high.  Slope ranges from 15 to 80 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C and the average annual precipitation is about 950 mm.",
