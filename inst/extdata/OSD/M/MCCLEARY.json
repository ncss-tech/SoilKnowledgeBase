  "OVERVIEW": "The McCleary series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a thin loess mantle.  McCleary soils are on lake plains and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
