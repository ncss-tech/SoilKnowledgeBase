  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McCleary soils are on lake plains and fan skirts adjacent to lake plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a thin loess cap.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,620 to 1,650 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Episaturation is present with a perched seasonal high water table between 15 and 46 cm (very shallow or shallow free water occurrence classes) between February and May.  Cumulative annual duration class is common.  These soils are susceptible to rare or occasional flooding."
