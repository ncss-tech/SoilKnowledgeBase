  "OVERVIEW": "The Marepas series consists of shallow over volcanic rock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff and volcanic rocks and volcanic ash. Marepas soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C.",
