  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Moston, Muskego, Toto, and Wawayanda series. Moston soils have more than 45 percent sand in the lower part of the control section. Muskego soils do not have mineral material within 130 cm (51 inches) of the surface. Toto soils have marly material (Lma) within the control section. Wawayanda soils do not occur on till plains and moraines and are in areas that receive more than 991 mm (39 inches) of annual precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Maxinkuckee soils are in depressions on till plains and moraines. Slope gradients range from 0 to 1 percent. They formed in herbaceous organic material over limnic material (coprogenous earth) over loamy till or lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 991 mm (35 to 39 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 10.6 degrees C (48 to 51 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 170 days. Elevation is 195 to 285 meters (640 to 935 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brookston, Muskego, Palms, Rensselaer, and Thomas soils. The Brookston and Rensselaer soils are loamy throughout and generally are at the outer margins of the depressions. The Muskego soils are not underlain by loamy sediments. The Palms and Thomas soils lack coprogenous earth."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the herbaceous organic material, moderately low in the coprogenous earth, and moderately high or high in the underlying loamy sediments."
