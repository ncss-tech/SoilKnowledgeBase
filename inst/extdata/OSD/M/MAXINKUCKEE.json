  "OVERVIEW": "The Maxinkuckee series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in herbaceous organic material over limnic material (coprogenous earth) over loamy till or lacustrine sediments in depressions on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

Muskego soils do not have mineral material within 130 cm (51 inches) of the surface. Toto soils have marly material (Lma) within the control section. Wawayanda soils do not occur on till plains and moraines and are in areas that receive more than 991 mm (39 inches) of annual precipitation."
