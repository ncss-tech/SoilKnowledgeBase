  "OVERVIEW": "The Marcetta series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces in intermountain valleys.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17  inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
