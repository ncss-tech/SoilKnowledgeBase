    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McCarey soils are on buttes and undulating lava plains. Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent. They formed in loess or silty alluvium and material weathered from basalt. The average annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 16 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F. Frost-free season is 60 to 110 days. Elevation ranges from 4,500 to 6,500 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Goodington, Manard, Rands, Portino, and Trevino soils. Goodington, Manard, and Rands soils are fine, montmorillonitic. Portino soils are coarse-silty. Trevino soils are shallow to bedrock. Goodington, Manard, and Rands soils are on older lava flows. Portino and Trevino soils are on landscape positions similar to McCarey but at lower elevations."
