  "OVERVIEW": "The McCarey series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess or silty alluvium and material weathered from basalt. Permeability is moderately slow. These soils are on undulating lava plains and have slopes of 0 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is 14 inches and the average annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",
