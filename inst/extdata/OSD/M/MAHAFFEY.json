  "OVERVIEW": "The Mahaffey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
