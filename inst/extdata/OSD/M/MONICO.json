  "STATES": "MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Monico series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty or loamy deposits, or both and in the underlying sandy loam or loamy sand till.  They are on ground moraines and in interdrumlin areas. Permeability is moderate in the silty or loamy deposits and moderately slow in the sandy loam or loamy till.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  The silty or loamy mantle on the till is as much as 30 inches thick.  The solum is extremely acid to slightly acid and the substratum is strongly acid to neutral.  Volume of pebbles ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the silty or loamy mantle and 5 to 25 percent in the till.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  Stony phases are recognized in some places.  Some pedons have a thin Oa or Oe horizon.\nThe A horizon has 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR hue; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  In some pedons the A horizon is discontinuous or so thin as to be impractical to describe.  The A horizon is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.\nThe E horizon has 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR hue; value of 4 to 6; and chroma is 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.\nThe Bs horizons have 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  When value and chroma are 3 in the horizon, it is less than 3 inches thick.  The Bs horizons are silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.  Some pedons have an E' horizon.  Some pedons have E/B, B/E, or 2Bw horizons.\nThe 2BC horizon has 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR hue; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.\nThe 2C horizon has 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR hue; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues."

Some pedons show an increase in clay below the Bs horizon but the increase is not enough to constitute an argillic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric horizon - zone from 0 to 7 inches (A and E); spodic horizon - zone from 7 to 21 inches (Bs1, Bs2); other features - frigid temperature regime - aquic moisture regime."
