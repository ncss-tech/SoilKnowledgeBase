  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  The silty or loamy mantle on the till is as much as 30 inches thick.  The solum is extremely acid to slightly acid and the substratum is strongly acid to neutral.  Volume of pebbles ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the silty or loamy mantle and 5 to 25 percent in the till.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  Stony phases are recognized in some places.  Some pedons have a thin Oa or Oe horizon.\nThe A horizon has 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR hue; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  In some pedons the A horizon is discontinuous or so thin as to be impractical to describe.  The A horizon is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.\nThe E horizon has 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR hue; value of 4 to 6; and chroma is 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.\nThe Bs horizons have 5YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  When value and chroma are 3 in the horizon, it is less than 3 inches thick.  The Bs horizons are silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.  Some pedons have an E' horizon.  Some pedons have E/B, B/E, or 2Bw horizons.\nThe 2BC horizon has 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR hue; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues.\nThe 2C horizon has 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR hue; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in silty or loamy deposits, or both and in the underlying sandy loam or loamy sand till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches."

The well-drained Goodman and moderately well-drained Iron River soils are adjacent on more sloping areas.  Cable soils are poorly drained and very poorly drained and in similar landscape positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Not all Monico pedons will meet the chemical requirements, as written, for a spodic horizon even though the podzolization process is well expressed.  Some pedons show an increase in clay below the Bs horizon but the increase is not enough to constitute an argillic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric horizon - zone from 0 to 7 inches (A and E); spodic horizon - zone from 7 to 21 inches (Bs1, Bs2); other features - frigid temperature regime - aquic moisture regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to NSSL sample numbers 82P1101-1104 and 82P1110-1114 for data on two Monico pedons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
