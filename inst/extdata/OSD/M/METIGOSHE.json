  "OVERVIEW": "The Metigoshe series consists of deep, well drained soils that are shallow over sand and gravel.  They formed in loamy alluvium underlain by sand and gravel alluvium on glacial outwash areas.  The permeability is moderate over very rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",
