The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 11 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has color value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon of sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and chroma of 1 moist or 2 dry. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has color value of 3 or 4 and 4 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is coarse sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy coarse sand. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has color value of 3 or 4 and 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2BC and 2C horizons have 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 to 6 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Metigoshe soils are on glacial outwash areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium underlain by sand and gravel.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 42 degrees F; and mean annual precipitation ranges from 21 to 27 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bottineau, Eramosh, Kelvin, and Rolla soils. Bottineau and Kelvin soils formed in glacial till and do not have the sand and gravel underlying material. Rolla soils formed in clayey glaciolacustrine sediments on nearby collapsed lake plains. Eramosh soils are in fens and are ponded during part of the growing season."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are primarily used for woodland pasture or wildlife habitat. Most areas remain in noncommercial stands of aspen, birch, oak and ash with an understory of shrubs. A few areas are used for the production of timber. Many lower-sloped areas have been cleared and used for small grains or hay."
