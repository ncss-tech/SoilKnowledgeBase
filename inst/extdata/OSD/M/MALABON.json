Awbrig and Conser soils are poorly drained and occur in depressions and on low terraces. Courtney soils are poorly drained and occur in depressions. Clackamas and Oxley soils are somewhat poorly drained. In addition, Clackamas soils have a very gravelly or extremely gravelly C horizon. Oxley soils are loamy-skeletal. Clackamas and Oxley soils occur on terraces. Darby soils occur on footslopes. Coburg soils occur on high flood plains and terraces. Redbell soils occur on low terraces."

Those soils associated with the low Winkle surface have a flooding hazard.\nThe Mart soils as defined in Washington are very similar. More investigation is needed to adequately separate."
