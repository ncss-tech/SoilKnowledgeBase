The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 55 degrees F. The pscs has 35 to 45 percent clay.  The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick and has 0 to 5 percent gravel. Up to 15 percent gravel are in some horizons in some pedons. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has 27 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent gravel.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe AB or BA horizon, when present, has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay. Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 moist to 20 inches or more, and 3 or 4 below 20 inches, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry.

Darby soils have a mollic epipedon 30 to 50 inches thick and are darker colored by 1 or 2 units of value in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Dixonville soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Silverton soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Mart soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 52 degrees F."

Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in loamy and clayey alluvium from mixed materials. The summers are warm and dry and the winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches. The mean January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."

Awbrig and Conser soils are poorly drained and occur in depressions and on low terraces. Courtney soils are poorly drained and occur in depressions. Clackamas and Oxley soils are somewhat poorly drained. In addition, Clackamas soils have a very gravelly or extremely gravelly C horizon. Oxley soils are loamy-skeletal. Clackamas and Oxley soils occur on terraces. Darby soils occur on footslopes. Coburg soils occur on high flood plains and terraces. Redbell soils occur on low terraces."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features include:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 29 inches (Ap, AB, Bt1, Bt2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 42 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons)\nParticle-size control section - the zone from 12 to 32 inches\nThe Malabon soils are found on the high and low Winkle geomorphic surfaces as recognized in the Willamette Valley, Oregon. Those soils associated with the low Winkle surface have a flooding hazard.\nThe Mart soils as defined in Washington are very similar. More investigation is needed to adequately separate.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for one pedon 67Oreg. 20-15(1-6), by OSU and published in Soil Science, Volume 109, No.5, 1970.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
