The particle-size control section has 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser. It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent in Ap horizon and decrease irregularly below. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe Ap or A horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Myzel soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface. Elevation is 1,800 to 2,500 feet. These soils are in a climate with warm moderately dry summers and cool moist winter. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 40 inches. The average January temperature is about 24 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 80 to 110 days."

This soil has an apparent high water table from January to mid-October and most of acres have an irrigation-induced water table at 30 to 48 inches during mid-May to mid-October growing season. This soil ranges from having no flood hazard when found on alluvial fans, to occasional, brief periods of flooding when found on flood plains."
