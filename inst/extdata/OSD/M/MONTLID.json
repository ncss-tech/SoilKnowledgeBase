  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 degrees to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 64 degrees to 67 degrees F. The soils are saturated at a depth of 24 to 60 inches in most years. The 10- to 40-inch control section ranges from silt loam to silty clay loam, 18 to 35 percent clay and some pedons have up to 15 percent coarse fragments.  Calcareousness of the profile ranges from moderate to strong due to soil deposition rather than vertical movement of lime. Textural discontinuities occur in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3."
