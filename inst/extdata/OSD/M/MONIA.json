The midgrasses are sideoats grama, sand lovegrass, sand paspalum, fall witchgrass, hairy grama, blue grama, and dropseed, and perennial threeawns. Woody shrubs consist of yucca, skunkbush sumac, and sand sage, and the occasional sand plum thickets. This is a fragile site and is subject to severe wind erosion if not protected by cover. This soil has been correlated to the Sandy (R077BY658TX) ecological site in MLRA-77B, 12-17\" PZ."
