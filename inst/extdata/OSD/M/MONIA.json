  "STATES": "NM,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Monia series consists of very deep, well drained, and moderately permeable soils. These soils formed in calcareous, sandy and loamy eolian deposits of Holocene age. Monia soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and interdunes with slopes ranging from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 406 mm (16 in), and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C ( 54 degrees F).",

Woody shrubs consist of yucca, skunkbush sumac, and sand sage, and the occasional sand plum thickets. This is a fragile site and is subject to severe wind erosion if not protected by cover.
