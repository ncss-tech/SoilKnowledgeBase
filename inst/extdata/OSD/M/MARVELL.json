The A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3; 7.5YR 4/4), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The B1 horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 4/4), or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin strata or subhorizons that are loamy fine sand and very fine sandy loam.  The 11B horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6) mottled with shades of gray; or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) or light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/1, 7/2) mottled with shades of brown."

Except for Lagrange soils none of these soils has lithologic discontinuity between the upper and lower B horizons.  The Dubbs, Gallion, Memphis, and Rilla soils have between 18 and 35 percent clay in the control section.  Goldman and Lagrange soils have mottles of chroma 2 in the upper part of the B horizon and within 20 inches of the surface.  Sterlington soils have yellowish red colors within the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Marvell soils are on nearly level and gently sloping and undulating terraces and natural levees.   Gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in thin coarse-loamy alluvial deposits over silty materials.  Near the type location, average annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.; average annual precipitation is about 51 inches."

Calloway, Dundee, and Grenada soils are on adjoining higher areas and lack the fine sandy loam A horizon.  Lagrange soils are on depressions and lower flood plain positions and have grayer colors."
