    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 60 to more than 80 inches thick.   A11 horizons range from very strongly acid to medium acid except when the soil has been limed.  The A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3; 7.5YR 4/4), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  The B1 horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 4/4), or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin strata or subhorizons that are loamy fine sand and very fine sandy loam.  The 11B horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6) mottled with shades of gray; or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) or light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/1, 7/2) mottled with shades of brown."

Except for Lagrange soils none of these soils has lithologic discontinuity between the upper and lower B horizons.  The Dubbs, Gallion, Memphis, and Rilla soils have between 18 and 35 percent clay in the control section.  Goldman and Lagrange soils have mottles of chroma 2 in the upper part of the B horizon and within 20 inches of the surface.  Sterlington soils have yellowish red colors within the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Marvell soils are on nearly level and gently sloping and undulating terraces and natural levees.   Gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in thin coarse-loamy alluvial deposits over silty materials.  Near the type location, average annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.; average annual precipitation is about 51 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Beulah, Calloway, Dundee, Grenada, and Lagrange soils.  Beulah soils are on adjoining areas that have thick fine sandy loam deposits.  Calloway, Dundee, and Grenada soils are on adjoining higher areas and lack the fine sandy loam A horizon.  Lagrange soils are on depressions and lower flood plain positions and have grayer colors."
