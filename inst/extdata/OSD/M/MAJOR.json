  "OVERVIEW": "The Major series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  Major soils are on stream terraces and relict basin floors.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63   degrees F.",
