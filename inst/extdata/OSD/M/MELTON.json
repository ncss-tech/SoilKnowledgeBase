  "OVERVIEW": "The Melton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium from glacial outwash. Melton soils are on stream bottoms of outwash terraces and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
