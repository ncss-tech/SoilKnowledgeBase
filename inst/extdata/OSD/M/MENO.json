Reaction of pedon ranges from medium acid to neutral. Depth to subhorizons having mixed matrix color or with chroma of 2 or less ranges from 20 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A horizon is less than 10 inches thick where the moist values and chromas are less than 3.5.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6 or has redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, red, or gray.   Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  The clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent.\nThe C horizon has color and texture like the Bt horizon.  In some pedons, the C horizon is stratified with thin beds of material ranging from loamy fine sand to clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family.  Soils in similar families include the Dougherty, Heatly, Nimrod, Nobscot, Stidham, and Vashti series.  Dougherty, Heatly, Nobscot, and Stidham soils lack redoximorphic features within 30 inches of the surface.  Nimrod soils do not decrease in clay content within 60 inches and have siliceous mineralogy.  Vashti soils have a loamy fine sand A horizon less than 20 inches thick and has siliceous mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Meno soils are nearly level to very gently sloping soils on broad, slightly undulating, high stream terraces of uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in sandy wind-blown and loamy alluvial sediments of Quaternary age.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 44 to 64.  Frost free days range from 190 to 230."

All of these soils have an A horizon less than 20 inches thick, and except for Devol and Eda soils, they have a mollic epipedon.  Also, the Carwile soils have a fine control section.  Eda soils have a loamy fine sand argillic horizon."
