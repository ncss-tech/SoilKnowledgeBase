    "content": "REMARKS:  The series was formerly included in the Mercedes series and mapped as a ponded phase.  Activity class and mineralogy based on a study conducted on the similar Mercedes soil sample P01TX061-001 and P01061-002.  Although these soils have aquic conditions for short periods in most years, the g horizon suffix has not been used.  These soils have low chroma colors that are presumed to be relict and related to parent material.  Future study will verify the presence of gleying.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in). (A2, Bss, Bkss1 Bkss2, and Bss3 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 71 cm (0 to 28 in). (A1, A2 and Bss horizons)\nDepth to redox concentrations: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in). (A1, A2, Bss, Bkss1, Bkss2, Bkss3, BC1 and BC2 horizons)\nDepth to redox depletions: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in). (A1, A2, Bss, Bkss1, Bkss2, Bkss3, BC1 and BC2 horizons)\nVertic features: The presence of slickensides at 43 to 152 cm (17 to 59 in).  (Bss, Bkss1, Bkss2 and Bkss3 horizons)\nUstic feature: have cracks 5 mm or wider in normal years, through a thickness of 25 cm or more, within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface for 90 or more cumulative days per year.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Particle-size analysis, salinity and sodicity tests by the soil survey project office lab.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
