  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 25 to 56 centimeters thick.   It includes the BA horizon and may include the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Areas in native sod have an A1 horizon that ranges up to 15 inches thick. The particle size control section averages more than 5 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam, but clay is allowed in places where the soil is eroded.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  In places the BA horizon is absent.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe upper Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry. Redoximorphic features range from faint to prominent.  Organic stains and coatings are on the faces of peds with the uncrushed faces of peds being one value darker and one chroma higher than the ped interiors.  The Bt1 horizon averages between 40 and 50 percent clay.  It is typically clay, but in places it is sandy clay.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe lower Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is typically clay, but includes sandy clay.  Reaction is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is clay or clay loam. Thin strata of dissimilar material ranging from silty clay loam to sandy loam are in the BC horizon of some pedons, but generally in the lower part. Reaction is slightly acid throughou moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture includes stratified clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, or sandy loam.  It is dominantly clay loam with an average clay content of 30 to 40 percent. Reaction is slightly acid through moderately alkaline."

These soils have 10YR or yellower hue in the particle size control section.  Chase, Martin, and Tina soils have a mollic epipedon more than 22 inches thick.  Arisburg, Flanagan, Grundy, Herrick, Ipava Rutland Seymore and Wymore soils average less than 5 percent sand in the particle size control section."

The soil formed in material reworked from weathered Kansan till.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 34 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 51 to 56 degrees F."

Pawnee soils are usually on higher topographic positions in the landscape.  Wymore soils formed in loess and are above Mayberry soils in the landscape.  Malcolm soils formed in grayish silts.  The Morrill soils are on similar positions but have a fine-loamy control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 25 centimeters (Ap and BA horizons); argillic horizon--the zone from 25 to 109 centimeters (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); aquic conditions--saturation and redox features at depths less than 40 cm; vertic characteristics--clay content greater than 35 percent; estimate linear extensibility to be 6.0 cm or more in upper 100 cm; and udic moisture regime.  Classification changed from fine montmorillonitic, mesic Aquic Argiudolls due to changes in Soil Taxonomy, 1992.\nCL 6/2008 Removed SE units from document. Edited English errors and converted SE units to metric. Changed permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
