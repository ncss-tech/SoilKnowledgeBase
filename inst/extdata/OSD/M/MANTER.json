  "OVERVIEW": "The Manter series consists of very deep, well to somewhat excessively drained soils formed in thick, calcareous, eolian or outwash material.  Manter soils are on hills and plains.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (49 degrees F.) at the type location.",
