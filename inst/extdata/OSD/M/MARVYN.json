  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.  Flakes of mica in the lower part of the Bt horizon range from few to common and from few to many in the BC and C horizons. The upper 20 inches of the kandic horizon averages less than 20 percent silt.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma 3 or 4.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe BA or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is dominantly sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; or there is no dominant color and it is variegated in shades of yellow, brown or red.  Mottles in the shades of yellow and red range from one to common.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue from 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; or there has no dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of yellow, brown, red and gray.  Texture is mainly sandy clay or sandy clay loam but ranges to sandy loam and is often stratified.\nThe C horizon is generally thinly stratified and has no dominant matrix color.  Color of the strata ranges from a hue of 10R to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8. The coarser-textured strata are generally reddish or brownish in color, while the finer-textured strata are generally grayish in color. Texture ranges from sandy loam to clay.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, is stratified and variegated and has the same range of colors as the C horizon.  Texture is loamy sand or sandy loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Barnwell, Cowarts and Springhill series in the same family and the Cahaba, Emporia, Kempsville, Smithdale, Stringtown and Suffolk series in similar families of the Southern Coastal Plain.  Barnwell and Cowarts soils are on similar positions. In addition, Barnwell soils have densic horizons and Cowarts soils have a solum thickness of less than 40 inches.  Springhill soils are on similar to higher positions and have redder subsoils.  Cahaba soils are on lower terrace positions that are subject to rare flooding and have redder subsoils. Emporia, Kempsville, Suffolk and Stringtown soils are on similar positions. In addition, Emporia soils have a seasonal high water table within 60 inches of the surface and Kempsville soils have subsoil layers in which 20 to 60 percent of the matrix is brittle.  Smithdale soils are on similar to higher positions and have redder subsoils.  Suffolk soils have moderately rapidly permeable to rapidly permeable C horizons.  Stringtown soils are in the western coastal plain of Texas and contain fragments or strata of shale and sandstone in the BC and C horizons."

Dominant slopes are 2 to 5 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in marine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the average annual temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F, and the average mean annual precipitation ranges from 52 to 56 inches."
