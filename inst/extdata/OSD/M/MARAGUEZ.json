  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Maraguez series is well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy materials weathered from volcanic rocks.  They are steep and very steep soils on side slopes and ridges of the humid uplands.  These soils are silty clay loam slightly acid in the A horizon; clay loam slightly acid in the cambic horizon and loam or silt loam in the C horizon.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 24 inches.  Depth to the semi-consolidated volcanic rock is over 60 inches.  Consistence is slightly sticky and slightly plastic in the whole profile.  Reaction is medium or slightly acid.  Fine rock fragments range from 2 to 10 percent throughout.  Organic carbon decreases regularly with depth.  The mean annual soil temperature is 76 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 and 3.  Texture is silty clay loam.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular.\nThe B2 horizons have matrix colors in hues of 10YR, values or 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 and 4.  Texture of the B2 horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam.  Texture of the B3 horizon is loam or silt loam.  Structure of the B horizons is weak fine or medium subangular blocky.\nThe C horizon is loam or silt loam."

The Caguabo, Juncos, Junquitos, Mabi, Malaya, Maresua, Montegrande, Mucara, Pandura, Plata and Quebrada series are similar soils in related families.  The Marado soils are pinkish and are shallower to the semi-consolidated rock.  The Caguabo and Malaya soils are shallower to the volcanic rock.  The Juncos, Mabi, Montegrande and Mucara soils all have finer textured and have higher COLE values.  The Junquitos soils have finer texture and low chroma mottles.  The Maresua soils have finer texture and are gravelly throughout.  The Pandura are coarser textured and shallow to the weathered rock.  The Plata soils have more than 35 percent by volume of gravel.  The Quebrada soils are finer texture throughout."
