Hue is 2.5Y and yellower, value is 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 6 moist with chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Myoma soils are nearly level to rolling, have hummocky micro relief where unprotected and are at elevations of 200 feet below sea level to 1,800 feet above sea level.  The soil formed in sand blown from recent alluvium.  The climate is arid with an annual precipitation of 2 to 4 inches that occurs as gentle winter rain or erratic high intensity summer storms.  The average January temperature is about 53 degrees F., average July temperature is 92 degrees F. and the average annual temperature is about 72 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free season (32 degrees F.+) is about 290 days."

Niland soils have contrasting textures in the control section, sandy over clayey.  Salton soils have a fine-silty control section."
