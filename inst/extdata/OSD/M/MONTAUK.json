  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mineral solum and depth to the dense substratum from the mineral soil surface ranges from 50 to 100 cm. Rock fragments range from 3 to 35 percent in the solum and 5 to 50 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have Oi, Oe, and/or Oa horizons overlying the A horizon. Combined thickness of the O horizons is 0 to 10 cm thick.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Structure is granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Undisturbed pedons have an A horizon that has properties similar to the Ap horizon.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Structure is subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have an E horizon up to 8 cm thick.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. The lower part has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Structure is subangular blocky and may part to granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Some pedons have an E, C, or BC horizon immediately above the Cd.\nThe Cd layer has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from coarse sand to fine sandy loam, and at least one sublayer of the Cd is loamy fine sand or coarser. The horizon has plates of geogenic origin or is massive. Consistence is firm or very firm and is brittle. Some pedons have firm dark reddish brown bands up to 1 cm thick that are spaced 12 to 20 cm apart. Silt coatings on the upper side of stones and gravel are common."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amostown, Bernardston, Broadbrook, Horseneck, Nantucket, Paxton, Scituate, and Wethersfield series. Amostown and Scituate soils are moderately well drained and have redoximorphic features in the B horizon. The Bearnardston, Nantucket, Paxton, and Wethersfield soils do not have sandy substratums. Broadbrook soils have a silty mantle with more than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand. Horseneck soils formed in friable glacialfluvial deposits and do not have a dense substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Montauk soils are on undulating to hilly slopes of terminal and recessional moraines in MLRA 149B and on glaciated uplands, hills, and ground moraines in MLRAs 144A and 145. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in loamy friable till underlain by firm sandy lodgment or flow till derived from granite with lesser amounts of gneiss and schist. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual precipitation is 889 to 1422 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C. The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 3 to 122 m above sea level."

    "content": "REMARKS: The typical pedon was updated from 1975NY103005 to the lab-sampled pedon S1998NY081002 that better represents the typical textures, horizonation, and location.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 34 to 87 cm (Bw1 & Bw2 horizons).\n3. Densic material - the zone from 87 to 184 cm (2Cd1 and 2Cd2 layers).\n4. Oxyaquic subgroup - based on saturation in one or more layers within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface, for either or both 20 or more consecutive days or 30 or more cumulative days.\n5. Lithologic discontinuity - at a depth of 87 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Full characterization data for pedons with User Pedon IDs of S1973MA009003, S1987NY103002, S1993MA011001, S1998NY081002, and S02MA-011-002. Pedons analyzed by the KSSL, Lincoln, NE. Laboratory characterization data for these pedons and similar soils is available through the National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
