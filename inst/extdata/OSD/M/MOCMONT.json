  "OVERVIEW": "The Mocmont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium weathered from argillite, igneous rock, or sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, hills, and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
