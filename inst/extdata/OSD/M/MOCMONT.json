  "OVERVIEW": "The Mocmont series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or alluvium weathered from argillite, igneous rock, or sandstone.  These soils are on alluvial fans, hills, and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
