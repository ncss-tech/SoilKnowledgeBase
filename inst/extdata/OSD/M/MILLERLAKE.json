  "OVERVIEW": "The Millerlake series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and other sediments derived from sedimentary rock.  These soils are on fan aprons, terraces, structural benches, and lower mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 457 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
