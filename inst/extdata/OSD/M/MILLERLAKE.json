  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Millerlake soils are on fan aprons, terraces, structural benches, and lower mountain footslopes and toeslopes.  They formed in slope alluvium and other sediments derived from sedimentary rock.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Elevations are 6,500 to 9,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F. and ranges from 34 to 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is less than 60 days."
