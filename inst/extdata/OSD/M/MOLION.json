  "OVERVIEW": "The Molion series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Molion soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
