  "OVERVIEW": "The Maybell series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from medium grained sandstone.  Maybell soils are on hills, breaks, old dunes, and undulating to rolling plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F.  The moisture control section is usually dry in all parts in July and moist in some parts for 60 cumulative days in August through October when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or greater.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  This horizon is absent in active dunes.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Thin layers, 3 to 5 inches thick, of sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam occur below 40 inches in some pedons."

Tusler and Trey series has a paralithic layer at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Zeomont soils are not moist in some parts for 60 cumulative days in August through October.  Zeona soils receive most of their moisture in the period from March through June."
