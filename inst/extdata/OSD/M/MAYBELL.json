Texture is sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon, when present, has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  This horizon is absent in active dunes.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.
