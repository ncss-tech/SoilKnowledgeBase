  "OVERVIEW": "The Marr series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in regolith of unconsolidated, sandy sediments.  They are nearly level to very steep soils on the inner Atlantic Coastal Plain.  They typically have a fine sandy loam A horizon, over a strongly expressed Bt horizon, underlain by variegated fine sandy loam or laomy fine sand.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 28 to 40 inches.  Unless limed, the soil is strongly acid in the A horizon and strongly acid to very strongly acid below.\nThe A horizons have hues of 7.5YR and 10YR, values of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are fine sandy loam, loam, and very fine sandy loam.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, values of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 through 8.  It is very fine sandy loam to sandy clay loam, the very fine sandy loam and fine sandy loam being confined to B1 horizons.  Nearly all sand size particles are in the fine or very fine classes.\nThe C horizon is commonly variegated in color.  It has hues of 5YR through 10YR, values of 4 through 8, and chromas of 4 through 8.  It is fine sandy loam to loamy fine sand becoming coarser with depth. Some pedons have a IIC2 horizon below 5 to 6 feet that contains significant amounts of glauconite.\nCOMPETING SERIES  The Jefferson, Lily, Lonewood, Sassafras, and Sunnyside series are in the same family.  Jefferson, Lonewood and Riney soils have thicker sola.  Lilly soils have bedrock within 40 inches.  Sassafras soils have coarse fragments that have a weighted average of 5 to 20 percent in the solum.  Sunnyside soils have hue of 2.5YR or 10YR in the Bt horizon.  The Norfolk and Westphalia series are similar soils in related families.  Norfolk soils have thicker sola and are thermic.  Westphalia soils have a thiner sola and have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section."

They are in the north central parts of the dissected inner Atlantic Coastal Plain.  Slopes betwen 2 and 12 percent are dominant, but slopes up to 20 percent are common and in a few places slopes range to 45 percent.  The climate is temperate and humid; mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Annual snowfall ranges from 5 to 30 inches."

The Adelphia, Collington, Donlonton, Monmouth, and Shrewsbury soils have significant amounts of glauconite within the series control section.  Aura soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the IIB2t horizons.  Evesboro and Galestown soils have sandy particle size control sections.  Howell soils have clayey particle size control sections."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  The Marr soils have been farmed for nearly 300 years, and there are very few areas that have not at one time been tilled.  The most important crop is tobacco.  They are also used for growing general crops, soybeans, and hay.  Most of the present woodlands consist of mixed hardwoods, dominated by oaks.  Some areas have moderate to heavy stands of Virginia pine, and in places shortleaf pine."
