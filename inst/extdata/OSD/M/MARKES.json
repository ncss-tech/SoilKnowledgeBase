  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  Depth to shale bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of shale range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the A horizon, 35 to 80 percent in the B horizon, and 60 to 90 percent in the C horizon.  Thin subhorizons may contain fewer rock fragments.  Reaction when cultivated ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the Ap horizon, from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the B horizon, and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the C horizon.  Kaolinite and illite are the dominant clay minerals.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Fine-earth texture ranges from loam to silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or N, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2, with strong brown, yellowish brown, light gray or grayish brown mottles.  Texture ranges from loam to silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Structure is fine or medium subangular blocky or blocky.\nSome pedons have thin BA and BC horizons.\nThe C horizon has similar color and texture as the B horizon."

The soils developed in materials weathered largely from gray shale.  The climate is humid temperate with mean annual precipitation of 36 to 46 inches, mean annual air temperatures of 50 to 55 degrees F., and a frost free season of 150 to 190 days."

Blairton soils do not have dominant low chroma colors immediately below the A horizon.  Bedington, Berks and Weikert soils are well drained and do not have low chroma colors.  Bedington soils also have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Brinkerton and Comly soils have fragipans.  Weikert soils have shale bedrock within 20 inches."

Argillic horizon - the zone from 11 inches to a depth of about 27 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data are available on two pedons sampled in Franklin County, Pennsylvania:  S65Pa-28-6 (1-5) and S65Pa-28-8 (1-5).\nClassification only was changed in 11/94, competing series and other changes will be made later.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
