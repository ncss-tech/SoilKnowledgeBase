These soils developed in loamy and clayey alluvium and colluvium from mixed, but dominantly igneous sources (trachytic and rhyolitic rock).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 67 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 180 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 4,000 to 6,695 feet."
