  "OVERVIEW": "The Moccasinhill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from phyllite, slate, schist, or other metasedimentary rocks. The Moccasinhill soils are on canyons and hills. Slopes range from 30 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 830 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 15 degrees C.",
