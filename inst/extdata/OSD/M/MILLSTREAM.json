Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 42.33 micrometers per second) in the solum and very high ( greater than 141.11 micrometers per second) in the underlying material.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil was formerly mapped Millbrook in McHenry County. Through MLRA update activities the areas which were mapped Millbrook in several geologic deposits were found to average 15 to 70 percent gravel in the lower part of the series control section whereas Millbrook soils average less than 15 percent gravel.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 36 cm (14 inches) (Ap and E horizons); argillic horizon- the zone from approximately 36 to 109 cm (14 to 43 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons); discontinuities at a depth of 69 cm (27 inches) - the contact between the Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons and at a depth of 119 cm (47 inches) - the contact between the 2BC and 3C horizons. The 10YR 4/2 clay films in the Bt1, Bt2, 2Bt3, and 2Bt4 horizons are considered iron depletions.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
