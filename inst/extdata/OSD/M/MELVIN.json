  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 60 or more inches..  Coarse fragments, mostly rounded pebbles, ranges from 0 to 5 percent to a depth of 30 inches and below this depth individual subhorizons can range from 0 to 20 percent by volume.  Content of iron and manganese concretions ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline throughout the profile.  A few flakes of mica are in some pedons.\nThe Ap and A horizon have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is a silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YRto 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, black, and red range from none to common.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, black, and red, range from none to many.  Some pedons are an evenly mottled pattern in shades of gray, brown, and red.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or loam.  Below a depth of 40 inches, some pedons have stratified layers with variable textures."

These soils formed in silty alluvium derived from soils formed from limestone, shale, siltstone, sandstone, and loess.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 59.4 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 53.9 inches."

In addition, the Huntington soils are well drained.  The Dunning soils have fine texture.  Lindside, Newark, and Nolin soils are the better drained members in a drainage catena with Melvin."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are in pasture and woodland.  These soils, where previously drained, are used for corn, sorghum, soybeans, and hay.  Many areas are used for wetland wildlife habitat. Native vegetation consists of water-tolerant hardwoods, chiefly water oak, pin oak, and swamp white oak, American sycamore, black willow, alder, sweet and blackgums, red maple, box elder, and cottonwood. Some areas were in canebrakes."
