  "OVERVIEW": "The Marietta series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils on wide floodplains.  Permeability is moderate.  These are nearly level soils that formed in loamy alluvium along streams that drain areas of the Blackland Prairie and Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Areas.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 28 to 60 inches thick.  The reaction ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline, except the surface layers in areas that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon in hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4; mottles having chroma of 2 or less are within a depth of 24 inches of the surface and commonly increase in size and abundance with depth.  The lower part of the Bw horizon commonly is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, and gray; in some pedons, it is gleyed and has a matrix in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, with mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, or silt loam.  The 10- to 40-inch control section has 18 to 30 percent clay.  Black concretions are few to many in the lower part of the B horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, with mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and gray; or it is mottled in shades of these colors.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or silt loam.  Fine to coarse black concretions are few to common."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Hamblen is the only competing series.  Closely related series include the Belden, Bruin, Catalpa, Commerce, Leeper, Lobelville, Mantachie, Thenas, and Whitesburg soils.\nHamblen soils typically have thinner sola with thin fragments of shale or sandstone and pebbles or cobbles of quartzite are throughout.  Belden and Commerce soils are fine-silty in the particle-size control section.  Bruin soils are coarse-silty in the particle-size control section.  Catalpa and Leeper soils are fine in the particle-size control section; also, Catalpa soils have a mollic epipedon, 10- to 24-inches thick.  Lobelville soils are strongly acid to medium acid and have chert fragments throughout.  Mantachie soils have a grayish matrix within a depth of 20 inches and are very strongly to strongly acid throughout.  Thenas soils are coarse-loamy in the particle-size control section and have mixed mineralogy.  Whitesburg soils have a mesic temperature class."

These are somewhat poorly drained soils that are across the nearly linear surfaces of floodplains and are in similar positions as the Marietta soils, except the poorly drained Tuscumbia soils, which are in slightly lower areas or backwater sloughs.  Houlka and Tuscumbia are fine in the particle-size control section; and in addition, Houlka soils are acid."
