Redoximorphic  features are betweeen depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Saturation for 1 month or more per year in 6 out of 10 years occurs at 40 to 60 inches.\nThe Ap or A surface horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral where limed.\nThe AB horizon or subsurface A horizon have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction typically ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral where limed.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 4 to 6.
