  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to coarser textured sediments ranges from 36 to 50 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid.  The water table fluctuates from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon texture ranges from silty clay to clay.  Color of the A horizon ranges from dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) to light brownish gray (10YR 6/4).\nThe B horizon ranges in texture from sandy clay to clay.  Color of the B horizon ranges from gray (5Y 6/1) to greenish gray (5BG 5/1).  It contains common to many, 20 to 30 percent of the mass, medium to coarse mottles, having chromas of 4 or more, and common to many dark bluish gray (5B 4/1) mottles.  Structure of B horizons is dominantly weak medium to coarse subangular blocky.  Thin discontinuous coatings are on vertical ped faces and along root channels.  Horizontal cleavage planes are very weak and have small amounts of coatings."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are in the Bajura, Candelero, Fortuna, Josefa, Talante, and Vayas soils.  The Josefa soils have A and upper B horizons that are coarser textured and free of low chroma mottles, and the mottled horizon is deeper in the profile.  The Talante soils are similar in drainage but are coarser textured.  The Fortuna soils are similar in depth, color, texture and drainage but are less acid.  The Candelero soils have coarser textured A horizons, stronger subsoil structure and contain many quartz and feldspar crystals throughout.  The Bajura soils are similar in texture and drainage but are less acid and have dark colored surface horizons.  The Vayas soils are similar in drainage and texture, but they are browner, and less mottled, and they are neutral to moderately alkaline in reaction."

The regolith consists of fine textured sediments derived from granitic rock.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation is 87 inches, and average annual temperature about 79 degrees F."

All these soils are on the nearly level flood plains, and they have formed in sediments derived mainly from granitic rock.  The Yabucoa soils are moderately fine textured and moderately well drained.  The Vivi soils are deep, well drained medium textured soils occupying the high well drained positions on the flood plains.  The Reilly soils are shallow gravelly soils on levees along the streams."
