  "OVERVIEW": "The Middlecreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Middlecreek soils are on alluvial fans, flood plains, and flood plain steps.  Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
