  "OVERVIEW": "The Marmotland series consists of very deep, moderately well drained or well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or till from granitoid rock and volcanic ash. Marmotland soils are on moraines, ground moraines and mountain valley floors. Slope is 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches (1,168 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F (5.0 degrees C).",
