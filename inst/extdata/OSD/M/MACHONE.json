The soils formed in residuum weathered from granitic rock. Elevations are 2,375 to 3,400 feet. The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches. The mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days."
