  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Machone series consists of moderately deep to strongly weathered granitic rock, well drained soils on hills and rock pediments.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from granitic rock. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 5 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
