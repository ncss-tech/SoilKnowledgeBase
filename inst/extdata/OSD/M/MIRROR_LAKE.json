The mean annual soil temperature at depth of about 20 inches ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F.  The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section averages very cobbly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand or extremely cobbly loamy sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the fine-earth is sandy loam or loam, with gravelly or cobbly modifiers. It has 20 to 65 percent total fragments composed of gravel, cobbles and stones.  Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe EB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine-earth is sandy loam, with some pedons having loamy sand in the lower part.  It has gravelly or cobbly modifiers with 35 to 70 percent total rock fragments, composed of gravel, cobbles and stones.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture of the fine-earth is loamy sand or sand, with gravelly, cobbly or stony modifiers.  It has 35 to 75 percent total rock fragments.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in light colored acid glacial till derived mainly from quartzite and sandstone.  The mean annual air temperature is 35 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer air temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 25 to 42 inches, most of which falls as snow.  The freeze-free period is 30 to 70 days."
