Ayon soils averages more than 18 percent clay and is dominated by stone and cobble. Curabith soils have mean annual soil temperature of 49 to 52 degrees F., and have mollic surface layers of 7 to 10 inches. Hogadero soils have strongly cemented calcic horizons. Modyon soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Hubert and Pena soils do not have lithologic discontinuities in the lower pedon containing stratified materials."
