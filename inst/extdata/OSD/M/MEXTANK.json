  "OVERVIEW": "The Mextank series consists of very deep, well drained soils on alluvial fans and fan terraces.  These soils formed in limestone and sandstone colluvium and alluvium.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
