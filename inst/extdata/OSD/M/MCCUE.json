These soils are usually moist but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The surface horizon has 1 percent or more organic matter to a depth of 4 to 7 inches. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 40 percent clay but the 2Bt1 horizon may have 35 to 50 percent clay. There is 0 to 3 percent gravel in the profile above the duripan. Depth to secondary carbonates, if present, is 42 or more inches. Depth to the duripan is 40 to 60 inches and depth to bedrock is 60 or more inches. Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 4 to 7 inches.\nThe Ap horizon chroma is 2 or 3 dry or moist. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral. Base saturation is 70 to 90 percent.\nThe 2Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Base saturation is 75 to 90 percent. Organic matter content is 0.3 to 1.0 percent.\nThe 2Bt3 horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline. Base saturation is 75 to 90 percent.\nThe 3Bqm horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 4 or 6 dry or moist. Cementation is weak or moderate."

Badgermont soils are in drainageways on piedmont slopes and are loamy-skeletal. Broadax soils are on hills, are fine-silty, and have a mollic epipedon. Hanning soils are on uplands, are fine-silty and have a pachic mollic epipedon. Mondovi soils are on flood plains of intermittent streams and lack argillic horizons. Van Nostern soils are on plateaus, are fine-silty, and are moderately deep to basalt bedrock."
