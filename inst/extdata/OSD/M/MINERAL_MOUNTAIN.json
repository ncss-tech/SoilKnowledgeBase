  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 24 to 47 inches thick.  The Cca horizon is 12 to 30 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 degress to 46 degress F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 60 degrees to 63 degrees F.  These soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but are continually dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days during the summer months in more than 7 our of 10 years.  The Al horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak medium platy to weak or moderate fine granular structure and is 6 to 9 inches thick.  The B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It ranges from cobbly heavy clay loam to light clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent cobbles.  This horizon is hard, firm or very firm, sticky or very sticky, and plastic or very plastic.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The Cca horizon has high lime accumulation and is cobbly in dome pedons."

The soil formed in deep soil material from alluvium or colluvium of igneous origin.  The climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 16 inches. Freeze-free period is about 80 to 100 days."
