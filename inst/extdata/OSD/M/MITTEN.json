  "REVDATE": "10/2008",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mitten series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over colluvium derived from argillite and quartzite bedrock.  Mitten soils are on mountain slopes and escarpments.  Slopes are 8 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
