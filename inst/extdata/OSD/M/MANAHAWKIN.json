Organic layers consist of mostly sapric material. Some pedons have subhorizons or a surface horizon of hemic material up to 25 cm (10 inches) thick. Woody fragments range from 0 to 50 percent, by volume, in the organic layers. These fragments are mostly twigs, branches, or logs ranging in size from 3 mm to 51 cm (1/8 inch to 20 inches) in diameter and completely break down when rubbed or crushed. & RANGE OF INDIVIDUAL HORIZONS:\nOa horizon:\nColor--hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or are neutral in hue and have value of 2 or 3. Broken face and rubbed colors are similar, but may differ one or two units in value or chroma.\nTexture--typically, muck (sapric material), but include individual layers of mucky peat (hemic material), especially at the soil surface\nA/Cg horizon (if it occurs):\nColor--hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 2\nTexture (fine-earth fraction)--sand, loamy sand or silt loam with mucky analogs\nCg horizon:\nColor--hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral in hue with value of 2 to 5\nTexture (fine-earth fraction)--coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand or fine sandy loam with gravelly analogs."
