  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are dry above a depth of 12 inches for half or more of the cumulative time soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but they are continually moist more than 1/4 of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. in some part of the 4 to 12 inch depth in 7 out of 10 years. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F. Carbonate content ranges from 40 to 55 percent. Gypsum flakes or nodules range from few to common. Organic matter content decreases irregularly with depth or remains above .35 percent to a depth of 50 inches. The A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3, and is moderately to strongly alkaline. The C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from heavy loam to light silty clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay, and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand including rock fragments up to 7.5 cm. This horizon contains 20 to 35 percent rock fragments, usually shale fragments, to a depth of 40 inches. It is moderately to very strongly alkaline."
