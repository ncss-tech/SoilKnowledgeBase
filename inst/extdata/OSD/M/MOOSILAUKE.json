  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to stratified sand and gravel range from 18 to 28 inches.  Rock fragments are mostly gravel and cobbles and range from 0 to 25 percent of the A and B horizons and 0 to 50 percent of individual layers in the 2C horizon.  Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with similar texture, structure, and consistence.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons of loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon that has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is similar to the Bg horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.  The sand is dominantly of medium or coarse size.  Many pedons contain thin strata ranging from fine sandy loam to gravel."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Saganing is the only other series currently in this family.  Saganing soils are from outside of Region R.  They formed in less acid glacial outwash that contains less than 5 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moosilauke soils are nearly level to strongly sloping and are in low depressions and shallow drainageways of uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in a thin mantle of coarse-loamy drift underlain by sandy and gravelly drift largely from crystalline rocks.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches, mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 degrees to 47 degrees F., and frost-free growing season ranges from 90 to 140 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Hermon, Lyme, Monadnock, Naumburg, Peru, Pillsbury, and Sunapee soils.  The well drained Hermon soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and the well drained Monadnock soils have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal particle-size control section.  These soils are in higher positions on the landscape than Moosilauke soils.  Lyme soils are in similar positions on the landscape but have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  The poorly and somewhat poorly drained Naumburg soils are on adjacent terraces and have sandier solums with spodic horizons.  The moderately well drained Sunapee and Peru soils are generally in higher positions on the landscape than Moosilauke soils.  Sunapee  soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and Peru soils formed in dense basal till.  The poorly to somewhat poorly drained Pillsbury soils have dense basal till substrata and are in similar positions on the landscape."
