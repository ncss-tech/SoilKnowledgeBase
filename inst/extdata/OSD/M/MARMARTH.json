  "OVERVIEW": "The Marmarth series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from soft sandstone.  These soils are moderately deep to soft sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 13 inches.",
