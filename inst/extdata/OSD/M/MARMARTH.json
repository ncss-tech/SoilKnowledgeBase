Assinniboine, Bostwick, Eapa, Evanot, Evanston, Jarre, Joplin, Kenilworth, Kevin, Perrypark, Peyton, Reicess, Sugakool, Telstad and Turret soils do not have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Berlake soils do not have a Bk horizon within a depth of 40 inches.  Cheesman soils have hues redder than 7.5YR and are noncalcareous throughout.  Crittenden soils have a lithological discontinuity.  Duffson soils have a lithic contact. Udecide soils have more rock fragments in the Bt and Bk horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marmarth soils are on level to hilly sedimentary uplands.  Slopes are plain or convex.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from soft fine grained sandstone.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches. Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Boxwell soils do not have an argillic horizon. Cabbart, Fleak and Yawdim soils do not have mollic epipedons and have soft shale or sandstone at shallow depths.  Chinook soils are coarse-loamy and do not have argillic horizons.  Ralph soils are fine-silty.  Rhame soils are coarse-loamy."
