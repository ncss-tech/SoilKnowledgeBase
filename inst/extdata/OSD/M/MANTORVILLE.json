Lamellae have been observed to depths of about twelve feet.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nMollic epipedon--the zone from the 0 surface to a depth of 15 inches;\nArgillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 15 to 30 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons);\nUdic moisture regime.\nLamellic feature - the zone from a depth of 48 to 80 inches (Bt part of the E&Bt horizon); total thickness of lamellae is less than 3 inches within a depth of 80 inches.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, ninth edition, 2003.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
