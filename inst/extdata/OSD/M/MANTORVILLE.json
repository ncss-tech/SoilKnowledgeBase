  "OVERVIEW": "The Mantorville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy sediments and in the underlying sandy outwash. The Mantorville soils are on uplands and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
