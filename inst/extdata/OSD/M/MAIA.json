Alire soils have volcanic glass in the coarse silt and very fine sand fractions.  Banquito soils are inactive. Brumley and Goesling soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the calcic horizon.  Nomrah soils are deeper than 40 inches to the base of the argillic and calcic horizon includes the Btk and Bk horizons. Pollow soils are moderately deep to conglomerate bedrock. Todest soils are moderately deep to limestone."
