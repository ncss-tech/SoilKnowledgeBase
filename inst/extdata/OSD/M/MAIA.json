  "OVERVIEW": "The Maia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic rocks and sediments.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Maia soils are on terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
