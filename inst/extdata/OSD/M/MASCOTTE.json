Albany and Plummer soils do not have spodic horizons and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  In addition, the somewhat poorly drained Albany soils are on higher positions and Plummer soils are on similar positions.  Chipley, Lakeland, Rutledge, and Scranton soils do not have spodic horizons and are sandy throughout.  In addition, the somewhat poorly drained Chipley soils and excessively drained Lakeland soils are on higher positions, and the very poorly drained Rutlege soils have umbric epipedons.  Ellabelle, Pelham, and Surrency soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness and do not have spodic horizons.  In addition, the poorly drained Ellabelle and Pelham soils are on similar positions and have Ellabelle soils have umbric epipedons while the very poorly drained Surrency soils are on similar to lower positions and have an umbric epipedon.  Leon, Lynn Haven, and Ridgeland soils do not have argillic horizons beneath the spodic horizon.  In addition, the somewhat poorly drained Ridgeland soils are on higher positions.  Olustee and Sapelo soils have argillic horizons below a depth of 36 inches.  In addition, the poorly drained Olustee soils are on similar to higher positions and the poorly to somewhat poorly drained Sapelo soils are on higher positions."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Large areas of Mascotte soils are used for tame pasture, truck crops, planted pines, and range.  Natural vegetation consists of creeping and chalky bluestem, indiangrass, low panicums, and pineland threeawn.  Longleaf pine, slash pine, sawpalmetto, gallberry, fetterbush, and waxmyrtle are the dominant woody plants on flatwoods sites.  Depressional areas are dominated by cypress, slash pine, sand pine, loblolly bay, black gum, red bay, red maple, and sweetbay.  The understory includes chalky bluestem, cinnamon fern, club moss, yelloweyed grass, pitcher plant, greenbriar, and sedges."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 16 inches (A, E horizons).\nAlbic horizons - the zones between depths of 3 and 16 inches, and 28 to 34 inches. (E, E' horizon).\nSpodic horizon - the zone between depths of 16 and 28 inches (Bh1 and Bh2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone below 34 inches (Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons).\nThe water table is estimated to rise to within 18 inches of the surface for 1 to 4 months during most years.  It is within depths of about 40 inches for periods ranging to about 6 months, but during the driest seasons it recedes to depths of more than 40 inches.  Depressional areas are ponded for several months during most years.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nFL0047 MASCOTTE    0-  2   65- 70  230-310  50- 60   120- 135\nFL0408 MASCOTTE    0-  1   65- 70  230-310  50- 60   120- 135\nFL0409 MASCOTTE    0-  2   65- 70  230-310  50- 60   120- 135\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nFL0047 NONE          0.5-1.5  APPARENT MAR-SEP  60-60\nFL0408 NONE             -     APPARENT    -     60-60\nFL0409 NONE   OCCAS    0-1.0  APPARENT FEB-SEP  60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nFL0047  0- 3  FS S                    0-  0 100-100  0- 5   5- 20\nFL0047  3-16  FS S                    0-  0 100-100  0- 5   1-  5\nFL0047 16-28  FS S LFS                0-  0 100-100  3-10  10- 40\nFL0047 28-34  FSL S LFS               0-  0 100-100  1- 8   2-  5\nFL0047 34-60  SCL SL FSL              0-  0 100-100 14-35   5- 15\nFL0047 60-80  FS S LS                 0-  0 100-100  5-13   2-  5\nFL0408  0- 6  S FS                    0-  0 100-100  0- 5   5- 20\nFL0408  0- 6  MUCK                    0-  0    -     0- 0  90-200\nFL0408  0- 6  MK-S MK-FS              0-  0 100-100  2- 5  15- 30\nFL0408  6-20  FS S                    0-  0 100-100  0- 5   1-  5\nFL0408 20-36  FS LFS S                0-  0 100-100  2-10  10- 40\nFL0408 36-80  FSL SCL SL              0-  0 100-100 14-35   5- 15\nFL0409  0- 3  FS S                    0-  0 100-100  0- 5   5- 20\nFL0409  0- 3  MK-S MK-FS              0-  0 100-100  2- 5  15- 30\nFL0409  3-19  FS S                    0-  0 100-100  0- 5   1-  5\nFL0409 19-34  FS S LFS                0-  0 100-100  3-10  10- 40\nFL0409 34-38  FS S                    0-  0 100-100  1- 8   2-  5\nFL0409 38-80  SCL SL FSL              0-  0 100-100 14-35   5- 15\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
