  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Manteo series are shallow and somewhat excessively drained.  They formed in material weathered from very strongly acid serecite schist.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments of schist with some quartz, slate or granite, range from 3 to 60 percent in the A and E horizons and from 35 to 80 percent in the Bw and C horizons.  Finely divided flakes of mica are common in some pedons.  Reaction in the solum ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 through 4.  The Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 6.  The fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 6.  The fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  The fine earth fraction is silt loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, is multicolored silt loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction."

Pickens soils have rock fragments of shale.\nThe Bremo, Briery, Catlett, Goldston, Hazel, Klinesville, Lousia, Louisburg, Manor, Mt. Airy, Sherando, Watt and Weikert series are in related families.  Bremo, Briery, Goldston, Hazel, Louisburg, Manor, Mt.  Airy, Sherando and Watt soils are deeper than 20 inches to bedrock.  Catlett, Klinesville and Weikert soils have temperature less than 59 degrees F.  Louisa soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Manteo soils typically are in gently sloping to very steep uplands.  Slopes are irregular with gradients typically between 10 to 35 percent but ranging from about 2 to 60 percent.  The soils developed in materials weathered from brown, pink, yellow, and reddish yellow very strongly acid serecite schist.  Rock outcrops of quartz are in some areas and granite in others.  Many rounded quartz gravel, which are remnants of old alluvial deposits, are on the surface in a few areas.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degree F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches."
