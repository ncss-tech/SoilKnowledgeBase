    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Maljamar soils are on nearly level to undulating sandy plains.  Slopes are usually less than 2 percent but some range to 5 percent.  The soils formed in moderately sandy to sandy mixed sediments somewhat reworked by wind.  The climate is semiarid to arid continental.  The annual temperature at the type location is about 65 degrees F. and the annual precipitation is 13 inches.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index ranges between 12 and 24."
