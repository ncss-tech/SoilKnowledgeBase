  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Maljamar series consists of deep to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils formed in moderately sandy to sandy mixed sediments somewhat reworked by wind. Maljamar soils are on sandy plains and have slopes of 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
