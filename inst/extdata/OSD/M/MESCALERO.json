  "OVERVIEW": "The Mescalero series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed from limestone.  Mescalareo soils are on ridgetops, crests and saddles of limestone hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
