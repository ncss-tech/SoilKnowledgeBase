  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mescalero soils are on gently to strongly sloping ridgetops, crests and saddles of limestone hills and mountains at elevations of 7,200 to 9,000 feet.  The parent materials are weathered from limestone.  The soils occur in a dry subhumid climate.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 to 24 inches with a summer maximum.  The mean annual temperature is about 32 to 45 degrees F.  The Thornthwaite P-E Index is about 30 to 45."
