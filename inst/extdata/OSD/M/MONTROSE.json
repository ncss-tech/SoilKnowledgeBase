  "OVERVIEW": "The Montrose series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from calcareous sandstone and shale. Montrose soils are on stream terraces, strath terraces and eroded fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
