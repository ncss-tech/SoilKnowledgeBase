  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Montross series are very deep and moderately well drained with moderately slow permeability.  They formed in fluvial sediments.  They are nearly level to gently sloping soils on the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches and mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F.",

Coarse fragments make up 0 to 5 percent of the soil.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid unless limed.  Aluminum saturation on the exchange complex is greater than 50 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon or BE horizon where present above the compact layer has hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. It normally has mottles with chroma of 2 or less.  It is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The lower part of the Bt horizon and the BC horizon, have hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 8, or are multicolored in shades of brown, red, gray, and yellow.  They are silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Structure commonly is platy and the consistence is firm or very firm and compact."
