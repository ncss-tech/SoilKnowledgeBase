  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Montross series are very deep and moderately well drained with moderately slow permeability.  They formed in fluvial sediments.  They are nearly level to gently sloping soils on the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches and mean annual temperature is about 58 degrees F.",
