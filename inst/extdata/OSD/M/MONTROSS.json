  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches or more.  Depth to a compact layer with platy structure ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Coarse fragments make up 0 to 5 percent of the soil.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid unless limed.  Aluminum saturation on the exchange complex is greater than 50 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon or BE horizon where present above the compact layer has hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. It normally has mottles with chroma of 2 or less.  It is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The lower part of the Bt horizon and the BC horizon, have hue of lOYR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 8, or are multicolored in shades of brown, red, gray, and yellow.  They are silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Structure commonly is platy and the consistence is firm or very firm and compact."

Ackwater soils are on similar landscapes and have a clayey particle-size control section.  Aycock soils are well drained and do not have brittle and compact layers.  Emporia soils are fine-loamy and are on slightly higher landscapes.  Savannah soils have a fragipan.  Lenoir soils are clayey and somewhat poorly rained."
