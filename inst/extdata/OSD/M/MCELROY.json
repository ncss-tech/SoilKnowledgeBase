    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McElroy soils are on footslopes and backslopes of mountains at elevations of 400 to 3,000 feet. Slopes are 5 to 90 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. Summers are warm and dry; winters are cool and wet. The mean annual precipitation is 45 to 65 inches. The mean January temperature is 26 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
