  "OVERVIEW": "The McElroy series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. McElroy soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
