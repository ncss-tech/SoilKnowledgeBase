  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McCarran soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in gypsiferous and calcareous mixed alluvium. McCarran soils are at elevations of about 1,500 to 2,400 feet in a warm arid climate where the mean annual precipitation averages between 4 and 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 63 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 180 to 260 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Elvada, Grapevine, Las Vegas and the competing Spring series.  Elvada soils have gypsic mineralogy and are found above McCarran soils on alluvial fans and terraces.  Grapevine soils have calcic horizons with little gypsum, but are on similar topograhic positions. Las Vegas soils generally occupy higher positions and have petrocalcic horizons.  Spring soils are found on similar or slightly lower topographic positions than McCarran soils."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The type location was relocated and series reclassified in 1/95 to better represent the present series concept.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in March of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedons are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 1 inch (A horizon).\nGypsic horizon - The zone from 9 to 62 inches (Cy1, Cy2, and Cy3 horizons).\nParticle size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Cy1 and Cy2 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The McCarran pedon described in Soil Survey Investigation Report No. 23, pg. 55 is from the same general area as the typical pedon described here.\nResponsibility for this series was transferred from Davis to Phoenix 11/2015.
