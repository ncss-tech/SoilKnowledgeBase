The mean annual temperature is about 63 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 180 to 260 days."

Elvada soils have gypsic mineralogy and are found above McCarran soils on alluvial fans and terraces.  Grapevine soils have calcic horizons with little gypsum, but are on similar topograhic positions. Las Vegas soils generally occupy higher positions and have petrocalcic horizons.  Spring soils are found on similar or slightly lower topographic positions than McCarran soils."
