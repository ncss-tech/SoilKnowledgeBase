  "OVERVIEW": "The Morganhills series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from tuffaceous sandstone.  Morganhills soils are hills and hillsides.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.   The solum is 5 to 8 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 35 percent rock fragments mainly as gravel and 5 to 20 percent clay.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Phosphate retention is 15 to 25 percent.  Volcanic glass is 30 to 50 percent.  The acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.3 to 0.6 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel.  It has 0.5 to 1 percent organic matter.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 3 moist.  It is gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or gravelly, loamy sand.  The very gravelly horizons typically occur immediately above the bedrock and are 1 to 4 inches thick.  It has 5 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles"
