The soil between depth of 8 to 18 inches is moist is all parts from about December 31 to about March 1 and is dry in all parts from April 15 to the latter part of November. The moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3 or 6/4, and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, or 5/3. It is loam or clay loam and averages 20 to 35 percent clay. It is strongly or violently effervescent with disseminated lime.  The EC is less than 2.0 mmhos. Gravel content is less than 5 percent.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, or 8/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, or 6/3.
