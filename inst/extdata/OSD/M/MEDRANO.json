    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Medrano soils are on backslopes of cinder cones.  They formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from scoria (cinders). Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,700 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Calabasas soils are deep to petrocalcic horizons, are fine-silty, and occur on summits of undulating plateaus. Churipa soils are shallow to duripans and moderately deep to basalt, are loamy, and occur on beveled summits and shoulders of undulating plateaus. Tetilla soils have calcic horizons below 40 inches, do not have cemented pans, and occur on toeslopes of undulating plateaus. Tsinat soils are moderately deep to petrocalcic horizons, have calcic horizons, and occur on beveled summits of plateaus."
