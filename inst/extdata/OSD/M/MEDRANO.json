  "OVERVIEW": "The Medrano series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to duripans. Medrano soils formed in slope alluvium over residuum weathered from scoria (cinders). They are on cinder cones. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
