Depth to the apparent water table is 2 to 4 feet during the winter and early spring.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1, 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Dry values of 6 are below 10 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is stratified very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.

This draft reflects a change in classification from coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Fluvaquentic Haploxerolls to ashy over loamy, mixed, mesic Aquic Vitrixerands.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are:\na.mollic epipedon from the surface to 10 inches, grayish mottles from 10 to 30 inches and an assumed irregular decrease of organic carbon with depth."
