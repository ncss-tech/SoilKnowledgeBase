These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  Depth to the apparent water table is 2 to 4 feet during the winter and early spring.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1, 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Dry values of 6 are below 10 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is stratified very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is stratified silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and fine sand."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mt. Vernon soils are on river flood plain splays and natural levees at elevations of 10 to 100 feet.  These soils formed in mixed recent alluvium with an admixture of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 25 to 50 inches. Mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 210 days."

This draft reflects a change in classification from coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Fluvaquentic Haploxerolls to ashy over loamy, mixed, mesic Aquic Vitrixerands.
