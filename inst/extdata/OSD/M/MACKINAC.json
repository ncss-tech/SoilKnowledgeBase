    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is commonly 20 to 30 inches thick but ranges from 18 to 42 inches in thickness.  Pebble and cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume throughout the pedon. The solum ranges from neutral to medium acid.\nWhere present, the A horizon, has hue of 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is 1 to 3 inches thick.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 5YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or sandy loam.  Small partially rounded remnants of Bt horizon are in the lower part of the E' horizon in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is a clay loam or loam.  In some pedons E' materials coat peds and is in cracks in the upper part of this horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, but 7.5YR is most common.  Value is 4 to 6 and chroma is 2 to 4.  It is a silt loam, loam, or sandy loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Brimley series.  Similar soils are the Belding, Capac, Charlevoix, Conover, Conant, Coral, Detour, Gaastra, Kawkawlin, Londo, Richter, Solona, and Twining series. Brimley soils are formed in variable textured lake laid sediments containing more fine sand and silt.  Belding , Charlevoix, Coral, Gaastra, and Richter soils have coarser textured sola.  Capac, Conover, Detour, Londo, Kawkawlin, and twining soils do not have spodic horizons.  In addition, the Detour soils are without argillic horizons and have very compact loam sandy loam C horizons and the Conover and Londo soils are mesic.  Conant soils do not have argillic horizons or mottling in the sopdic horizon and lack argillic horizons.  Solona soils do not have spodic horizons."
