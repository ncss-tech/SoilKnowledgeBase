These soils are continually dry for more than 60 consecutive days during the summer in more than 7 out of 10 years.  The moisture regime is Xeric bordering on Aridic.\nThe mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to the argillic horizon is 5 to 15 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates is greater than 36 inches.  The particle size control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is clay loam or clay.  It has thin to moderately thick and continuous clay films on faces of peds.  Effervescence is none to slight.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Effervescence is slight to strong.  It is mildly to moderately alkaline.  Rock fragment content is 0 to 15 percent."
