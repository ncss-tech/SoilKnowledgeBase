  "OVERVIEW": "The Maxton series is a member of the fine-loamy over sandy or sandy- skeletal, siliceous, thermic family of Typic Hapludults. These soils have grayish brown and pale brown sandy A horizons and yellowish red sandy clay loam B2t horizons. They have sola less than 40 inches thick over sand.",

Flakes of mica range from none to few. Gravels or pebbles range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Ap or A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy loam. Content of silt is less than 20 percent.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam. It contains considerably less clay than the Bt horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is stratified loamy sand, sand, coarse sand, or gravelly sand."

Cahaba soils have more than 20 percent silt in the control section.  Kalmia and Masada soils have an argillic horizon in hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  Norfolk, Orangeburg, and Ruston soils have sola more than 60 inches thick.  Rumford soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section. Wickham soils have mixed mineralogy."

Dominant slopes are 0 to 3 percent but range to 6 percent.  These soils formed in coarse-textured marine or stream deposits.  Mean annual temperature is 62.5 degrees F, near the type location, and mean annual rainfall is about 46 inches."
