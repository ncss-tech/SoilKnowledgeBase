  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Laidig, Marbie, Neabsco, Tarklin, and Teddy series. Laidig soils have fragipans deeper than 30 inches.  Marbie and Teddy soils formed in a mantle of loamy material and the underlying residuum from bedrock and have a discontinuity below the fragipan.  Neabsco soils are stratified and formed in marine and fluvial sediments on the Coastal Plain. Tarklin soils formed in colluvium or alluvium from limestone and have fragments of chert throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches."

Alonzville, Botetourt, Caverns, Coursey and Ingledove soils do not have a fragipan and are on similar landscapes. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert contain more rock fragments in the subsoil and are on uplands. Also, Berks and Lehew soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock, and Weikert soils 10 to 20 inches to bedrock.  Broadway, Clubcaf, Gladehill, Gullion, Newmarc, Nomberville, and Wolfgap soils have mollic epipedons and are on flood plains. Derroc soils contain more rock fragments in the subsoil and are on flood plains.  Frederick and Groseclose soils contain more clay in the subsoil and are on uplands. Shottower soils contain more clay in the subsoil and are on high terraces."

Fragipan - the zone from 18 to 65 inches (Btx horizon).\nUdic moisture regime.\nSoils now within the range of the Moomaw series were correlated Monongahela in several published soil surveys.\nSIR = VA0309, VA0299 (GRAVELLY)\nMLRA = 128, 130, 147\nREVISED = 1/4/1990\nADDITIONAL DATA: Morphological, chemical, textural, and mineralogical data are reported in:\nEdmonds, W. J., D. D. Rector, D. A. Gall, D. R. Hatch, R. S. Joslyn, and J. C. Baker. 1987. Properties and classification of soils derived from stratified alluvium in the Valley and Ridge Province of Virginia.

The 1/2006 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement is based on similar soils and on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when additional data becomes available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 1/90\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
