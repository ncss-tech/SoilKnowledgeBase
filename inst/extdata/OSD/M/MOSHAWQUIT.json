  "OVERVIEW": "The Moshawquit series consists of very deep, well drained soils on ground moraines and outwash fans.  These soils formed in sandy outwash underlain by  loamy till and by calcareous, sandy outwash.  Permeability is rapid in the  sandy outwash, moderate in the loamy till, and rapid or very rapid in the calcareous outwash. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth is measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Thickness of the loamy deposits ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Depth to underlying sandy deposits ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  The weighted average clay content ranges from 8 to 18 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 35 to 65 percent in the particle-size control section.  Rock fragments are a mixture of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary.  The sedimentary rocks are mostly dolomite.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the sandy mantle, 2 to 15 percent in the loamy deposits, and 0 to 35 percent in the underlying sandy deposits.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the profile.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part of the solum and strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.  Typically, reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline in the substratum, but in some pedons the upper part is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is a mat of partially decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. It is sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nMoshawquit soils have a glossic horizon (2E/B or 2B/E horizons, or both). The 2E part has color like the E' horizon above. It is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam. The 2Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Typically, it is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam, but thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam are in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon with color and texture like the 2Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt or 3BC horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs. It is stratified in some pedons.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly analogs."
