    "content": "TYPICAL PEDON:  McCornick - loam.\n0 to 5 inches; light-gray (10YR 7/2; between light-gray and pale-brown, 6/2.5, moist) loam that is strongly calcareous.  Strong medium and fine granular structure with some evidence of weak platiness.   The granules are slightly hard when dry and friable when moist; moderate amount of organic matter (1 to 1.5 percent). (4 to 11 inches thick)\n5 to 11 inches; strongly calcareous very pale-brown (10YR 7/3; brown 5/3, moist) loam with moderate medium and fine granular structure; granules are slightly hard when dry and friable when moist; horizon is low in content of organic matter and moderately permeable. (5 to 10 inches thick)\n11 to 21 inches; white; very pale-brown (10YR 8/4) moist; loam that is strongly calcareous, massive, and weakly blocky; breaks to subangular and angular fragments and with further pressure to fine somewhat granular particles or to a powder.  This horizon appears to be soil that has formed from the underlying blocky marly deposit; slightly hard when dry, friable when moist, and moderately permeable. (5 to 13 inches thick)\n21 to 28 inches; white, (8/2, when moist) lime-cemented hardpan, probably of loam texture, that breaks to angular fragments that are hard to very hard when dry, firm when moist, and slowly permeable. (3 to 13 inches thick)\n28 to 72 inches; white; white to very pale-brown (10YR 8/2 to 8/3) moist; loam that is strongly calcareous; material occurs as strong coarse blocks that are moderately hard when dry and firm to friable when moist; material is not compact but appears to be moderately permeable; moderately to strongly mottled with pale yellow in places; not known whether the mottling is due to imperfect drainage or to stains made by an organic growth."
