Halloran soils have natric horizons with a lower boundary at depths of 11 to 36 inches clay content of 10 to 18 percent.  Mazourka soils have natric horizons with a lower boundary at depths of 11 to 40 inches and have a particle-size control section that averages 12 to 18 percent clay.  Tennco soils do not have soil temperatures below 47 degrees during January and February."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mobl soils are on alluvial flats.  These soils formed in alluvium primarily from volcanic tuffs with minor amounts of limestone and quartzite.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations are 4,000 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is arid with hot summers and cool winters, typical of the Mojave Desert.  The mean annual precipitation is between 4 and 7 inches; mean annual temperature is between 60 to 65 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 200 days."
