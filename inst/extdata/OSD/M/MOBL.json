  "OVERVIEW": "The Mobl series consists of very deep, well drained soils  that formed in mixed alluvium from mainly volcanic tuffs with minor amounts of limestone and quartzite. Mobl soils are on alluvial flats. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 4 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
