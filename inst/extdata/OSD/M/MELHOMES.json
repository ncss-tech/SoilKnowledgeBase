  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid in all horizons.  The A horizon is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or N/, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of less than 2.  The combined thickness of the A horizon with value of 3.5 or less ranges from 6 to 10 inches.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or N/, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of less than 2.  Mottles range from none to common in colors of brown, yellow, and gray.  Texture is loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand.  Some pedons have thin strata of sandy loam and sandy clay loam materials below 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Scranton series in the same family, and the Chipley, Dianola, Osier, and Plummer series.  Scranton soils are better drained, and have slightly cooler mean annual temperatures.  Chipley soils lack dark surface layers 6 inches or more thick, are moderately well drained, and are not dominated by gray colors throughout.  Dianola soils lack dark surface layers 6 inches or more thick, and have mean annual temperatures greater than 72 degrees F.  Osier soils have 5 inches or less of dark colored A horizons.  Plummer soils have an argillic horizon 40 to 60 inches below the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Melhomes soils are on concave poorly defined drainageways, that are nearly level or gently sloping.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in thick beds of recent sandy colluvium from coastal plain sediments of Pleistocene age, mainly from the Willis formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches.  Summer rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Summer moisture deficit ranges from 0 to 4 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 72."

Boykin, Corrigan, Doucette, Letney, Newco, Rayburn, Shankler, and Tehran soils are higher in the landscape on uplands.  They all have B horizons containing more clay.  Iuka soils are on broad stream bottom, have defined stream channel, and are in a coarse-loamy family."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Melhomes soils are poorly drained.  Runoff is very slow, and permeability is rapid.  The water table is at or within 12 inches of the surface for 12 months in most years.  These soils flood frequently for brief periods."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils are used mainly for timber, but a few areas are used for pasture.  Forest vegetation is mostly scattered loblolly pine with some black gum, red maple, sweetgum, bay, and wateroak.  The understory is grasses, sedges, and shrubs that are water tolerant.  Pastures are mainly bermudagrass and bahiagrass."
