  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Marumsco series are very deep, and moderately well and somewhat poorly drained.  They formed in stratified marine sediments of the low Coastal Plain Terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
