These soils developed in stratified marine sediments of sand, silt and clay that contain a relatively high content of feldspar.  These soils are commonly at elevations from about 5 to 30 feet above sea level.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 60 degree F."
