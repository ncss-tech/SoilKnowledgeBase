Tiger Creek typically occupies lower hillslope positions and interfluve areas. Nedsgulch soils develop from schist, phyllite, and other similar metasedimentary rocks. Beybek and Aquariusmine soils are thermic and occupy lower elevations and warm aspects. Beybek soils are moderately deep to lithic contact and Aquariusmine soils are fine-loamy."
