  "REVDATE": "08/2005",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The McQuade series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess and underlying fine, dense till on till plains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is very slow. Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",

An Ap horizon ranging from 6 to 9 inches in thickness is in cultivated areas and has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or clay loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2B/E and/or 2E/B horizons have characteristics similar to the horizons above and below them.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McQuade soils are on linear to slightly concave surfaces of till plains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in a thin mantle of loess and underlying fine, dense glacial till deposited by the St. Louis sublobe of late Wisconsin age. Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches. The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days. Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1600 feet."

The moderately well drained Hibbing, somewhat poorly drained Buhl and very poorly drained Fayal soils form a hydrosequence with the McQuade soils. The very poorly drained Daisybay and Dora soils are on broad flats and in depressions and formed in organic materials over till. The very poorly drained Rifle soils are in depressions and formed in organic materials."
