  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Montvale series consists of shallow or very shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone.  Montvale soils occur on gently sloping to hilly uplands and have slopes of 2 to 25 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degree F.",
