    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. There are cracks 1/2 to 3/4 inches in width and 20 to 35 inches in depth that open and close each year in the fall after irrigation season. Depth to aquic conditions and the irrigation-induced water table is 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 30 to 60 inches. The upper 7 to 10 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 10 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.2 to 0.4 percent. Base saturation throughout the upper 30 inches is greater than 75 percent. The particle-size control section has 40 to 55 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It has a weighted average of 15 to 35 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in Ap and A horizon. Depth to a 2Bss3 horizon with more than 35 percent rock fragments ranges from 30 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry. Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It has 0 to 10 percent rock fragments and 40 to 55 percent clay.\nThe 2Bss horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. The upper part is very gravelly sandy clay or very gravelly clay with 40 to 55 percent clay and 30 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones. The lower part is extremely gravelly sandy clay, very gravelly sandy clay loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam with 30 to 45 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones."
