The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The soil has 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent gravel. It has an estimated 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and 0.2 to 0.4 extractable Al + 1/2Fe.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 5 moist and dry.

Mineral soils are moderately deep to granitic bedrock and have 7 to 12 percent clay.  Peahke soils are moderately deep to sedimentary rock and has channers throughout the profile.  Pelican soils are deep to glacial till and have 10 to 18 percent clay.  Scoap soils are very deep to bedrock, have 8 to 12 percent clay, and have a mollic epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick.  Wellspring soils are very deep to sedimentary rock and have channers throughout the profile."
