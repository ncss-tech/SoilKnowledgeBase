The soil has 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 5 to 15 percent cobbles, and 15 to 25 percent gravel. It has an estimated 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and 0.2 to 0.4 extractable Al + 1/2Fe.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 5 moist and dry.

Frint soils have a mollic epipedon 20 to 24 inches thick and is moderately deep to basalt bedrock.  Hogranch soils are deep to basalt bedrock and have a mollic epipedon 20 to 29 inches thick.  Mineral soils are moderately deep to granitic bedrock and have 7 to 12 percent clay.  Peahke soils are moderately deep to sedimentary rock and has channers throughout the profile.  Pelican soils are deep to glacial till and have 10 to 18 percent clay.  Scoap soils are very deep to bedrock, have 8 to 12 percent clay, and have a mollic epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick.  Wellspring soils are very deep to sedimentary rock and have channers throughout the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Magill soils are on hills.  They formed in residuum derived from igneous rock with an influence of ash in the surface horizons.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation is 4,900 to 5,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.   The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 28 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 30 to 80 days."
