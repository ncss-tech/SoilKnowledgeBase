    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Miltonhills soils are on the backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from acidic tuff mainly associated with the Valley Springs Formation. Elevation is 60 to 650 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 885 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 240 to 340 days."

Amador, Gillender, and Pentz are also on hills, typically with less relief but have a paralithic contact within 50 centimeters. Pentz has a mollic epipedon. Jennylind and Ospital form on erosion remnants, lack an umbric epipedon, and have a lithic contact within 50 cm. Pardee soils are found on terrace remnants and eroded fan remnants, have a lithic contact within 50 centimeters, and are loamy-skeletal. Redding soils form on fan remnants, have a duripan within 50 to 100 centimeters, and have an argillic horizon with 35 or more percent clay. Laniger soils occupy similar geomorphic positions but have andic soil properties and a lithic contact within 50 to 100 centimeters."
