  "OVERVIEW": "The Mariano series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material from sandstone over coarse alluvium derived from igneous sources.  Mariano soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
