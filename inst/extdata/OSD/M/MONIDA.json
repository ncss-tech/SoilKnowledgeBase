  "OVERVIEW": "The Monida series consists of very deep and well drained soils on fan remnants, foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 45 percent.  They formed in slope alluvium or colluvium derived from calcareous siltstone, sandstone and loess.  The mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",
