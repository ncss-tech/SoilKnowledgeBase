The soil formed in local alluvium or colluvium derived from calcareous siltstone, sandstone and loess.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 19 inches.  It falls dominantly in the late autumn through early summer.  A winter snowpack of 1 to 3 feet lasting through March is common.  Summers are warm and dry.  The mean annual air temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F.  The frost free season is 30 to 70 days."
