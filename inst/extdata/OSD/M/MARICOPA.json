  "OVERVIEW": "The Maricopa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in recent alluvium from mixed sources, dominantly acid and basic igneous rocks. Maricopa soils are on flood plains, alluvial fans and low stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

The climate is arid and semi-arid continental. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 56 degrees to 69 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 12 inches. The frost-free period is 180 to 275 days."
