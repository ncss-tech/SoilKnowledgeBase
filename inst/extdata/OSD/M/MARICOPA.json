    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are dominantly 0 to 3 percent but range to 5 percent. These soils have formed in moderately coarse and coarse-textured recent alluvium from mixed sources. The climate is arid and semi-arid continental. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 56 degrees to 69 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 12 inches. The frost-free period is 180 to 275 days."

Anthony and Gila soils are coarse-loamy and do not have strongly contrasting textures in the lower part of the control section. Brazito and Vinton soils are sandy. Glendale soils are fine-silty."
