  "OVERVIEW": "The McDonald series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till, glaciolacustrine deposits and tertiary deposits. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills and glacial moraines. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
