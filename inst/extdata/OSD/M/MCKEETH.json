Caudle soils have less than 20 percent rock fragments in any horizon and lack unconformable very gravelly loamy sand horizons.  Tocan soils have noncalcareous B horizons.  Unsel soils are at elevations of 4,600 to 6,500 feet and are moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days during the period of July through September following convection storms.  Vigus soils have less than 15 percent gravel in the solum and lack very gravelly or extremely gravelly material within 40 inches."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from volcanic rocks.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches; the average annual air temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F, and the frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."
