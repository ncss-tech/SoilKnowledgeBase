  "OVERVIEW": "The McKeeth series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan piedmonts and fan terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium. Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes are 2 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Caudle soils have less than 20 percent rock fragments in any horizon and lack unconformable very gravelly loamy sand horizons.  Tocan soils have noncalcareous B horizons.  Unsel soils are at elevations of 4,600 to 6,500 feet and are moist in the upper part for 10 to 20 days during the period of July through September following convection storms.  Vigus soils have less than 15 percent gravel in the solum and lack very gravelly or extremely gravelly material within 40 inches."
