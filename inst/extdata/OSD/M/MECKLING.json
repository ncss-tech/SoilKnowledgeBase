  "OVERVIEW": "The Meckling series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy alluvium. These soils are on plane to convex slopes on flood plains and low stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is 585 millimeters.",
