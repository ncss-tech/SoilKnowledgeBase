Thickness of loess or other silty deposits over the residuum weathered from granite rock (grus) ranges from 15 to 36 inches.  Below the influence of agriculture lime, reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid in the solum and in the substratum.  The control section averages between 7 and 18 percent clay and between 30 and 50 percent fine sand or coarser.  Volume of pebbles is 0 to 10 percent in the silty deposit, 2 to 20 percent in the till, and 15 to 90 percent in the residuum (grus).  See REMARKS section for a discussion on the character of the coarse fragments in the residuum.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 2 percent in the upper part of the solum (silty deposits) and 0 to 8 percent in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 3.\nThe Bs horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The high chroma colors are similar to those of spodic horizons; however, they do not meet the chemical requirements for spodic horizons.\nThe E horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles are few to many and faint to prominent.\nMylrea soils have E/B or B/E horizons or both.  The E/B or B/E horizon has tongues of E material surrounding thin columnarlike upward extensions of the Bt horizon or wholly surrounding small isolated remnants of the Bt horizon.  The tongues of E have 10YR hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E/B or B/E horizons have few to many distinct or prominent mottles.\nThe Bt1 horizon and the Bt part of the B/E horizon have 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6, but in some pedons the chroma is 2.\nThe 2Bt2 horizon has 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogues.  The 2BC horizon has similar colors to the 2Bt2 horizon, but differs in a higher gravel content.\nThe 3C horizon has 2.5Y, 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 8.  It consists of an accumulation of waste consisting of angular, coarse-grained fragments resulting from the granular disintegration of crystalline rocks (esp. granite).  The pebble size and cobble size fragments crush to sand size material without much difficulty."

Slopes are along drainageways and in depressions and range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mylrea soils formed in 15 to 36 inches of loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying glacial till and residuum (grus) weathered from granite.

These soils are of small extent.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota\nSERIES ESTABLISHED:  Langlade County, Wisconsin, 1984.\nREMARKS:  Mylrea pedons show some evidence of clay movement, but laboratory data indicates insufficient increase in clay to constitute an argillic horizon.\nThe highly weathered granite (grus) has undergone extensive chemical and mechanical weathering and the granite pebble size and cobble size fragments crush to sand and silt size fragments.  The pebble size fragments, in place, behave as gravel in-so-far as the bulk density, permeability, and available water are concerned.  As a construction material the pebble size fragments crush to sand and silt size material.  The logical UNIFIED classification is SM or SP.  The pebble size fragments are not suitable for aggregate so it is not a probable source of sand or gravel.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 3 inches (A); albic horizon - from 9 to 12 inches (E); cambic horizon - from 12 to 38 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2BC); although there are clay films in the upper parts of the B horizon, there is not at least 3 percent more clay in the B horizons than the eluvial horizon (E); other features - have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 60 cm of the soil surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
