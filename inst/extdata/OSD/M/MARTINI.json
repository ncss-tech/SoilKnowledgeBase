  "OVERVIEW": "The Martini series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone, limestone, and granite.  Martini soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
