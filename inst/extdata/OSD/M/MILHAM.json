    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Anway, Avenal, Bryman, Bucklebar, Dutchflat (T), Garlock, Hi Vista, Lanip (T) and Neuralia series. Anway soils (MLRA 40), on nearly level valley plains, have color hues in the Bt horizon of 7.5YR or 5YR, are not calcareous in the Bt horizon and have highly stratified C horizons. Avenal soils (MLRA 17), on alluvial fans, have 25 to 35 percent sand content, have electrical conductivity that is less than 2 decisiemens per meter and sodium adsorption ratio of 1 or less. Bryman soils (MLRA 30), on terraces and older alluvial fans, have color hues in the Bt horizon of 5YR and have a surface that has been largely reworked by wind action with 3 to 8 percent clay. Bucklebar soils (MLRA 40, 41, 42), on alluvial fans and coalescent fan piedmonts, are intermittently moist for more than 20 days cumulative during July through September and have color hues of 7.5YR through 2.5YR in the Bt horizon. Dutchflat (T) soils (MLRA 30), on fan terraces, have color hues of 10YR or 7.5YR and have 15 to 60 percent gravel in the Btk and Bk horizons. Garlock soils (MLRA 30), on old stream terraces and alluvial fans, do not have calcareous B horizons, have color hues of 10YR or 7.5YR and C horizons that have loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or coarse sand with gravelly and very gravelly equivalents of each. Hi Vista soils (MLRA 30), on hills and rock pediments, have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Lanip (T) soils (MLRA 30), on erosional fan remnants, are usually moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July to October following convection storms and have Bkq and 2Bkq horizons. Neuralia soils (MLRA 29, 30), on alluvial fans, fan terraces and plains, at 2,300 to 2,800 feet elevation, has a frost-free season of 200 to 250 days, has a surface that is covered with about 30 to 60 percent fine gravel, have mean annual precipitation of 4 to 6 inches, with some precipitation as snow and are not calcareous in the A horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Milham soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans or plains and occasionally on low dissected terraces. Slope is 0 to 9 percent. These soils formed in alluvium weathered from granitic and sedimentary rock sources. Elevation is 200 to 1,450 feet. The climate is arid (desert) and has hot dry summers and cool winters. Mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches. Mean January temperature is about 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees to 65 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 250 to 300 days."
