    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mantree soils are on mountainflanks and mountaintops below lahars. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium from andesitic tuff breccia over residuum weathered from intrusive igneous rock. Elevation is 850 to 1300 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 1100 to 1300 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. The frost free season is 190 to 215 days."

Devilsnose and Lilygap are medial in the upper part of the control section. Devilsnose soils occur on the middle to upper portions of mountainflanks and Lilygap soils occur on the lower portions. Redapple soils are fine and are on stable summits and backslopes. Holland, Musick and Wukusick occur on similar landform positions and also formed in  intrusive igneous bedrock, but lack low bulk densities with oxalate-extractable Al+1/2Fe greater than 1.0 percent in the surface horizons. Holland soils occur on high hills, mountain slopes and canyons."
