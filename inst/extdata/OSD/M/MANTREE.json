  "OVERVIEW": "The Mantree series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from andesitic tuff breccia over residuum weathered from intrusive igneous rock. The Mantree soils are on mountainflanks and mountaintops below lahars. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1240 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.",

Redapple soils are fine and are on stable summits and backslopes. Holland, Musick and Wukusick occur on similar landform positions and also formed in  intrusive igneous bedrock, but lack low bulk densities with oxalate-extractable Al+1/2Fe greater than 1.0 percent in the surface horizons. Holland soils occur on high hills, mountain slopes and canyons."
