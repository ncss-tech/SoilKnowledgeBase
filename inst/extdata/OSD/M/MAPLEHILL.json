  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. KMc-WDH",
  "REVDATE": "11/2000",
  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Maplehill series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on bottom lands and also on lake plains as alluvial fans at the mouth of drainageways from adjacent uplands.  They formed in recent silty alluvium and an underlying buried soil.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipatation is about 44 inches.",
