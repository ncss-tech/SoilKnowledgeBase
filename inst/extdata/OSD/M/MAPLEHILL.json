    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Oridia and Wakeland series in the same family and the Algiers series.  Algiers soils are fine-loamy.  Oridia and Wakeland soils do not have a buried dark colored A horizon within a depth of 36 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEORGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEORGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maplehill soils are on bottom lands and also on lake plains as alluvial fans at the mouth of drainageways from adjacent uplands.  The slope gradient is 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in recent silty alluvium and an underlying buried soil formed in silty material.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 inches to 45 inches."
