  "OVERVIEW": "The Mani series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slow permeable soils on floodplains of the Humid Coastal Plains MLRA.  They formed in fine textured alluvial deposits of mixed origin.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 74 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
