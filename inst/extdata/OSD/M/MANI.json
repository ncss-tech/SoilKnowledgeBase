In addition, Bajura soils poorly drained, Coloso soils have kaolinitic mineralogy and more clay in the control section, the well drained Dique soils are and natural levees near the stream channel, and have fine-loamy control sections, and the well drained Toa soils have mollic epipedons.  Lares soils are on higher terrace positions, have argillic horizons, and have more clay in the control section."
