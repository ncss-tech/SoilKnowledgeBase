Alexandria soils do not have a densic contact within 102 cm (40 inches). Brushcreek soils have a paralithic contact between 102 and 152 cm (40 and 60 inches). Lairdsville soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within 102 cm (40 inches). Lucas soils have more than 35 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Ozaukee soils average more than 50 percent silt in the lower part of the series control section. Schoharie soils have hue redder than 10YR in the middle and lower parts of the series control section. St. Clair soils average more than 50 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

This series will be classified with illitic mineralogy, but as additional data is analyzed it could be changed to mixed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 74 cm (Bt horizon).\nDensic contact: at 74 cm (top of the Cd1 horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features present in horizons below a depth of 51 cm.\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 401649 represents the 12 to 18 percent slope, severely eroded phase in northern Indiana.\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 401647 represents the silt loam surface, 2 to 6 percent slope, eroded phase in northern Indiana.\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 401648 represents the silt loam, eroded phase in northern Indiana.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (AD8003) from the Purdue University Soil Characterization Laboratory, AES Bulletin No. 360, Vol. 7, Pg. 93.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
