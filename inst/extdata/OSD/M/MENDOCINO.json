  "OVERVIEW": "The Mendocino series is a member of a fine, illitic, isomesic family of Ustic Tropohumults.  These soils have very dark grayish brown, moderately acid, clay loam A horizons, and yellowish brown, strongly acid, light clay Bt horizons.  They have medial development and are deep to soft sedimentary rocks.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 36 to 66 inches.\nThe A horizons range in color (dry) from brown or pale brown to light brownish gray or very pale brown in the 10YR and 7.5YR hues with values of 4 to 6 and chromas of 2 to 4; in texture from loam to clay loam; and in reaction from slightly to moderately acid.  Some pedons have tend to an A2 horizon that is strongly acid, and paler in color than horizons above and below it.\nThe B horizons range in color from reddish brown to light yellowish brown in the 5YR and 10YR hues with values of 4 to 6 and chromas of 4 to 6; B3 horizons are distinctly redder (5YR to 7.5YR) moist but fade considerably on drying (10YR).  Textures in the B horizons range from sandy clay loam to light clay.  Reaction ranges from strongly to very strongly acid increasing with depth into strongly acid C horizons of highly weathered sandstone."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Included are the Empire, Goldridge, Horseshoe, Josephine, Larabee, Sebastopol, and Sites series.  Empire soils (Typic Umbrihumults) have darker and redder umbric epipedons and have fine loamy control sections.  Goldridge soils have less than 1 percent O.M. in their ochric epipedons and also have fine loamy control sections. Horseshoe soils (Ustic Ochrihumults) are gravelly throughout, redder, and in a mesic family.  Josephine soils (Typic Normustults) have redder A horizons, less acid and less thick B horizons, derived from hard sedimentary and meta-sedimentary rocks, and in a mesic family.  Larabee soils have thick, dark grayish brown mollic epipedons with fine silty control sections.  Sebastopol soils have massive A horizons, and redder throughout with chromas of 8 moist, and have massive, extremely acid clay B horizons with maximal development.  Sites soils, derived from meta-sedimentary rocks have umbric epipedons, are redder throughout with massive Kaolinitic clay B horizons, and in a mesic family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mendocino soils occur on upper gentle slopes and flat ridgetops (remnants of old erosional land surfaces), in moderately steep to steep, well dissected mountains.  Usually the soils occur from deeply and highly weathered sandstone and shale rocks of an unamed cretaceous formation.  Slopes range from 5 to 45 percent, but are dominantly 10 to 35 percent.  The steep side slopes are usually Hugo and Josephine soils.  Mendocino soils range from near sea level to 1500 feet elevation, in a humid, mesothermal climate with cool, rainless but foggy summers, and cool wet winters.  Annual precipitation is 40 to 90 inches. Mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.; January average 49 degrees F.; July average 57 degrees F.; frost free season exceeds 333 days."

Conglomerate phases mapped in northern Humboldt and Del Norte Counties may correlate with Horseshoe series.  Classification based on the following: Ochric epipedon, argillic horizon, have more than 20 kilos organic matter/cubic meter, and are seasonally dry in some part for more than 60 days.\nOSED scanned by SSQA. Last revised by state on 2/66.\nSeries reclassified 5/95.  Competing series not updated at that time.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
