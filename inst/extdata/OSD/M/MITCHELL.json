    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 11 inches (Ap and A horizons).\nThe Mitchell soils are mapped extensively in the aridic-ustic and ustic-aridic moisture regimes in Ne, Co, Wy, and SD.  Further study is needed to determine if reclassification, new series or both are needed.  Soils mapped in the aridic-ustic moisture regime would now classify as Aridic Ustorthents.  This subgroup was added to Taxonomy in 1992.  An alkali phase of the Mitchell series is recognized.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
