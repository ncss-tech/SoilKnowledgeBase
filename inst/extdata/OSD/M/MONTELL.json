  "REVDATE": "11/2010",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Montell series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on valley sides or valley floors. Slopes range from 0 to about 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).",
