Range vegetation consists mainly of fourflower trichloris, alkali sacaton, tobosa, vine mesquite, curlymesquite, white tridens, whiplash pappusgrass and other short and midgrasses. Nonsaline areas produce pink pappusgrass, sideoats grama, and buffalograss also. Invading plants include scrubby mesquite, whitebush, and pricklypear.
