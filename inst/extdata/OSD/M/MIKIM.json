  "OVERVIEW": "The Mikim series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Mikim soils are on alluvial fans, drainageways, and valleys.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Kishona soils soils are moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section for less than 90 cumulative days when the soil at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more and are not moist for 45 consecutive days following July 15.  Neville, Paradox, and Pojoaque soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the control section.  Shavano, Thedalund, and Theedle soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tsosie soils are highly stratified in the lower part of the C horizon with sandy loam and silt loams.  Also, Tsosie soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section from April 15 to July 1."

The former La Plata County type location was in an Ustic moisture regime bordering on Aridic, with a precipitation of 15 inches.\nThis series, although having some soil structure described in underlying horizons, does not exhibit other additional supporting evidence of a cambic horizon, namely a soil color change or the removal or translocation of calcium carbonate or gypsum.\nTaxonomy version, 2nd Edition, 1999\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Lab Pedon No. 83P0803\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
