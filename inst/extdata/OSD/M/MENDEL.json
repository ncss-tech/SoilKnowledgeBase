  "OVERVIEW": "The Mendel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium or alluvium over till derived from granitic rocks. The Mendel soils are on flood plain steps of glacial-valley bottoms and cirque floors of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 920 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
