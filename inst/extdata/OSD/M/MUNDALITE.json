  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mineral solum thickness and depth to densic layer is typically 64 to 100 cm. Depth to bedrock is 150 cm or greater. Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent in the solum and from 5 to 50 percent in the substratum. The spodic horizon typically is greater than 46 cm thick. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the mineral solum and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe O horizon consists of slightly to highly decomposed plant material. It is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 2.5, and chroma of 1 or 2. In some pedons the reaction ranges to ultra acid.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2, or the horizon is neutral. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is very friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 3, or the horizon is neutral. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand. Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or less, or hue of 10YR with value and chroma of 2 or less. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular, weak prismatic, or subangular blocky. Consistence is predominantly very friable or friable, but may also have firm masses in some pedons.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 to 5. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Structure is weak subangular blocky. Consistence is dominantly friable, but some pedons have firm masses in the upper part.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand. Structure is subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or sandy loam. It is massive or has plate-like divisions of geogenic origin. Consistence is firm or very firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Becket, Marlow, Mundal, and Plaisted series. Becket, Marlow, and Plaisted soils typically have spodic horizons that are less than 46 cm thick. Also, Marlow and Plaisted soils have higher silt contents in the solum. Mundal soils have a greater duration of saturation in the subsoil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mundalite soils are gently sloping to very steep soils formed in loamy till with a dense substratum. They are usually on convex backslopes and upper footslopes of glaciated uplands. Most areas have boulders covering from 0.1 to 3 percent of the soil surface. Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent, but is dominantly 8 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges 1,015 to 1,524 mm; mean annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C; and the frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. Elevation ranges from 500 to 1,000 m above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hogback, Rawsonville, Knob Lock, Ampersand, and Wilmington soils. Hogback soils have bedrock at 25 to 50 cm deep. Rawsonville soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm deep. Knob Lock soils are dominantly organic deposits in areas of bedrock controlled landforms. The somewhat poorly drained Ampersand and poorly drained Wilmington soils are on the lower part of footslopes or on toeslopes."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The separation of the Mundalite from the Mundal series is not clear. Further work is needed to better differentiate the two concepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 3 to 10 cm (E horizon).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 61 cm (Bhs1, Bhs2, and Bs horizons).\nOxyaquic subgroup - redoximorphic features within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface (BC2 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Engineering test data and characterization data are available for Essex and Hamilton Counties, New York for pedons 86NY031003, 87NY031004, 88NY041011, and S1993NY031003. Characterization data for Mundalite and similar soils is available through the National Cooperative Soil Survey Soil Characterization Database: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
