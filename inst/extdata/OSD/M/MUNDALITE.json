  "OVERVIEW": "The Mundalite series consists of well drained soils that formed in loamy till. They are moderately deep to dense till and very deep to bedrock. They are on backslopes and upper footslopes of glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,175 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent in the solum and from 5 to 50 percent in the substratum. The spodic horizon typically is greater than 46 cm thick. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the mineral solum and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe O horizon consists of slightly to highly decomposed plant material. It is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 2.5, and chroma of 1 or 2. In some pedons the reaction ranges to ultra acid.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2, or the horizon is neutral. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is very friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 to 3, or the horizon is neutral. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand. Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, and value and chroma of 3 or less, or hue of 10YR with value and chroma of 2 or less. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular, weak prismatic, or subangular blocky. Consistence is predominantly very friable or friable, but may also have firm masses in some pedons.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 to 5. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Structure is weak subangular blocky. Consistence is dominantly friable, but some pedons have firm masses in the upper part.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand. Structure is subangular blocky or platy.

They are usually on convex backslopes and upper footslopes of glaciated uplands. Most areas have boulders covering from 0.1 to 3 percent of the soil surface. Slope ranges from 3 to 60 percent, but is dominantly 8 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges 1,015 to 1,524 mm; mean annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C; and the frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days. Elevation ranges from 500 to 1,000 m above sea level."

Rawsonville soils have bedrock at 50 to 100 cm deep. Knob Lock soils are dominantly organic deposits in areas of bedrock controlled landforms. The somewhat poorly drained Ampersand and poorly drained Wilmington soils are on the lower part of footslopes or on toeslopes."

Further work is needed to better differentiate the two concepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 3 to 10 cm (E horizon).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 61 cm (Bhs1, Bhs2, and Bs horizons).\nOxyaquic subgroup - redoximorphic features within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface (BC2 horizon)."
