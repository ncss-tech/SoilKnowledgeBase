    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bennington, Blount,  Del Rey, Fulton, Kimmell and Nappanee series. Bennington soils are typically mapped in MLRA 111E and have rock fragments dominated by sandstone, shale, and crystalline lithology. Blount, Kimmell and Nappanee soils have calcium carbonate equivalent of more than 15 percent in the lower part of the series control section.  Del Rey and Fulton soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments and typically do not have rock fragments in the series control section. Fulton soils average more than 45 percent clay in the particle size control section.\nThe Brockport, Caneadea, Churchville, Lockport, Odessa, Pyrmont, Remsen, and Rhinebeck series are in a related family.  Brockport and Lockport soils have a lithic contact between 51 to 102 cm (20 and 40 inches). Caneadea soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments and typically do not have rock fragments in the series control section.  Churchville soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments over loamy till.  Odessa soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments and are redder.  Pyrmont soils have mixed mineralogy. Remsen soils average more than 45 percent clay in the particle size control section. Rhinebeck soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments and have endosaturation."

The till is derived primarily from shale and siltstone, with minor amounts of limestone and crystalline erratics. Slope is primarily 0 to 6 percent, but ranges to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 830 to 1320 mm (33 to 52 inches), and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The C horizon needs evaluation during MLRA update activities to determine if they meet the requirements for dense till.  Future MLRA projects have been created (2014) to properly evaluate this issue.\nThe shale and sandstone substratum phases of the Mahoning series have bedrock that is at depths of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) and are typically noncalcareous to bedrock. Textures of the C horizon are silty clay loam and silty clay (shale substratum phase), loam and sandy loam (sandstone substratum phase) and includes channery analogues. It is anticipated that these substratum phases will become new series during modernization projects. Data on clay mineralogy indicates 50 percent illite.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap, Eg horizons);\n2. argillic horizon - the zone from 23 to 76 cm (9 to 30 inches) (Btg, Bt1, Bt2 horizons);\n3. aquic conditions - the zone from 18 to 152 cm (7 to 60 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data is available for the following profiles sampled in Ohio:  AB-58, GA-S19, ER-29, HU-E6, HU-S6, LK-16, LR-5, LR-7, LR-8 (location of the typical pedon), LR-16, LR-S3, LR-S6, MD-14, MH-18, MH-30, PG-S5, PG-S10, and ST-1.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
