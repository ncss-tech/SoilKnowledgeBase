The moderately well drained Eel, well drained Genesee, and somewhat poorly drained Shoals soils are members of a toposequence that do not have a mollic epipedon. Eel soils are on similar landscape positions. The well drained Ross and Rossburg soils commonly are on higher landscape positions or are nearer to stream channels. The somewhat poorly drained Shoals and the very poorly drained Sloan soils typically are on lower landscape positions or are farther from stream channels."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the substratum. Unless protected, Medway soils are subject to flooding."
