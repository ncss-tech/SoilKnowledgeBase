  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are typically calcareous throughout, but some pedons may be leached a few inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees to 44 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is about 53 degrees to 59 degrees F. The control section is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam and averages between 10 and 18 percent clay. Gravel ranges from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3. It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. It averages between 40 and 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent that decreases by more than 5 percent in a lower horizon. This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The Ard (T) series is in the same subgroup but has 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent below the mollic epipedon. The Feltonia (T) series is closely related but has a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick and has less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section."

Elevation is 7,200 to 8,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 38 degrees to 42  degrees F. The frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
