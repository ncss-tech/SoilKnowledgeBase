  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 50 inches to more than 80 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the A horizon, from extremely acid to moderately alkaline in the E horizon, and very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the Bw and Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where the value is 3 or less, thickness is 7 inches or less.  Texture is sand or fine sand or their mucky analogues.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, and brown range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, and brown range from few to many.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with these values.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have a loamy sand or loamy fine sand layer in the upper part."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Meadowbrook soils are on broad low flats and along narrow small streams.  They formed in sandy and loamy sediments of the Southern Coastal Plain and the Atlantic and Gulf Coast Flatwoods.  The climate is warm and humid.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Goldhead, Pelham, Plummer, and Sapelo soils.  Goldhead soils have sandy epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Pelham and Plummer soils have a base saturation less than 35 percent.  In  addition, Pelham soils are Arenic.  Sapelo soils have Bh horizons."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of Meadowbrook soils are used for forest.  A few areas have been cleared and are used for pastureland.  Vegetation includes mixed stands of slash pine, loblolly pine, and longleaf pine with live, laurel, and water oaks, blackgum, sweetgum, red maple and cypress in wetter areas.  The understory consists dominantly of gallberry, waxmyrtle, wiregrass, pitcher plants, and bracken fern."
