  "OVERVIEW": "The Meadowbrook series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on flats and small stream flood plains of the Southern Coastal Plain and the Atlantic and Gulf Coast Flatwoods.  They formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the A horizon, from extremely acid to moderately alkaline in the E horizon, and very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the Bw and Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where the value is 3 or less, thickness is 7 inches or less.  Texture is sand or fine sand or their mucky analogues.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, and brown range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, and brown range from few to many.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with these values.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have a loamy sand or loamy fine sand layer in the upper part."
