The classification was changed due to changes in taxonomy. This soil was described and sample to 242 cm (87 in) the ranges in thickness range to 203 cm (80 in)\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 44 cm (0 to 17.3in). (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 44 to 203 cm (17.3 to 80in). (Bt horizons)\nGlossic horizon: 44 to 55 cm (17.3 to 21.7in). (E/Bt and Bt/E horizons)\nAdditional Comments:  The perched water table lasts long enough to meet the oxyaquic subgroup criteria. This is based on soil moisture studies conducted on similar soils in the region.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  KSSL Data from type location 90LA011020.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
