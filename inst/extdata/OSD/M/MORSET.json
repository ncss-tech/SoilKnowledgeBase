    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Accola, Madigan, Michelson, Oro_fino, and Philipsburg series.\nAccola soils have an O horizon, and have rock fragments dominantly of limestone, which are presumed angular (colluvium).\nMadigan soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.\nMichelson soils have a buried argillic horizon below 40 inches.\nOro fino soils have a discontinuity with sandy-skeletal material.\nPhilipsburg soils are not clearly separated; they appear to be moist in the moisture control section for longer periods because of their 14 to 24 inches of precipitation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Morset soils are on fan remnants, high terraces, plateaus, and outwash terraces.  Slopes range from about 2 to 25 percent.  These soils formed in thick, calcareous, medium to moderately fine textured, alluvium or outwash derived from sedimentary, igneous, and metamorphic rocks.  Elevation is 8,200 to 8,800 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 to 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 37 to 45 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 55 degrees F.  Warmer annual temperatures occur in southern latitudes in the state."
