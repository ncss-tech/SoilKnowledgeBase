  "OVERVIEW": "The Mijay series consists of moderately deep over a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, predominantly andesite.  Mijay soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 8 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
