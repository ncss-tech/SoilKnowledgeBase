Kiona soils have mainly cobbles in the particle-size control section and a mean annual soil temperature of 10 to 12 degrees C.  Nibbs soils have secondary lime within 38 cm. Veet soils have a period of appreciable summer moisture for 10 to 20 days in the summer and sola 30 to 50 cm thick.  Veta soils have 5 to l5 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 71 to 100 cm deep to carbonates. Wifton soils have 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in colluvium derived from chert, shale and mixed volcanic rocks with some influence from volcanic ash.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
