  "OVERVIEW": "The Minat series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from chert, shale and mixed volcanic rocks with some influence from volcanic ash.  Minat soils occur on hill and mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
