  "REVDATE": "11/2006",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mident series are very shallow to shallow over soft Entrada formation sandstone, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium, eolian sand and sandstone residuum derived from the Entrada formation. Mident soils are on hillslopes on structural benches. Slopes range from 2 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
