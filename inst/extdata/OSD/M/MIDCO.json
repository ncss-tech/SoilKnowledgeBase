    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from l to l0 inches. Chert content 3 inches to 2 mm in size ranges from 20 to 80 percent by volume, and approximately 75 percent is 3 inches to l/4 inch in size. Rock fragments larger than 3 inches range from 5 to 30 percent.  The soil ranges from neutral to strongly acid.  Some pedons have buried A horizons.\nThe A horizon has l0YR hue, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is gravelly or very gravelly analogues of sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has l0YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture commonly is gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of loam or sandy loam, but may be extremely gravelly sand or loamy sand in the lower part."
