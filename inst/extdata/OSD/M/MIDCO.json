  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "Midco series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, cherty soils on flood plains. They formed in recent alluvium derived largely from upland soils underlain by cherty dolomite and sandstone.  Slope gradients range from 1 to 4 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 1 to 10 inches. Chert content 3 inches to 2 mm in size ranges from 20 to 80 percent by volume, and approximately 75 percent is 3 inches to 1/4 inch in size. Rock fragments larger than 3 inches range from 5 to 30 percent.  The soil ranges from neutral to strongly acid.  Some pedons have buried A horizons.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is gravelly or very gravelly analogues of sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe C horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture commonly is gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of loam or sandy loam, but may be extremely gravelly sand or loamy sand in the lower part."
