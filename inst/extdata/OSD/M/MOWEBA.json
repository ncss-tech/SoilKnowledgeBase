    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick.  Combined thickness of the A and Bw horizons ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  Texture in the particle-size control section (10 to 40 inches) is gravelly or very gravelly loam, gravelly or very gravelly silt loam, or cobbly loam, that averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 69 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist when the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F., but are dry for 50 to 80 consecutive days during the summer.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 35 percent in the A horizon and from 35 to 70 percent in the Bw horizon.  The base saturation is 75 percent or less in some parts or all of the upper 30 inches.\nThe A horzion has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  This horizon range from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 8 dry, and moist.  It ranges from gravelly loam or very gravelly loam to cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, or very gravelly silt loam.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral, and is 15 to 50 inches thick.\nThe C horizon where present has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6 dry and moist.  It ranges from very gravelly fine sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or cobbly sandy loam to very gravelly loamy fine sand, very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly loam.  This horizon is medium acid to mildly alkaline."

Doodlelink and Piersonte soils have hue of 10YR throughout.  Lamondi soils have hue of 10YR in the upper part of the cambic horizon and no redder than 7.5YR hue in any part.  Gimlett (T) and Scoap soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Umatilla soils have an O horizon and have a discontinuity between the A and B horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moweba soils are at elevations of 5,500 to 8,000 feet.  They occur on mountainsides and fan terraces on all aspects, but dominantly north and east exposures.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and local alluvium weathered from sandstone and quartzite conglomerate.  The climate is moist subhumid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F., and the freeze-free period ranges from 60 to 80 days."

(A1, A2, Bw1 horizons)\nUltic Feature - the soil has a base saturation of 75 percent or less within 30 inches of the surface.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
