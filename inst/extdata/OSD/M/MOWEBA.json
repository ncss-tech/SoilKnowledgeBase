  "OVERVIEW": "The Moweba series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium and glacial outwash from sandstone and quartzite conglomerate.  These soils are on mountainsides and fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

Texture in the particle-size control section (10 to 40 inches) is gravelly or very gravelly loam, gravelly or very gravelly silt loam, or cobbly loam, that averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 69 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist when the soil temperature is more than 41 degrees F., but are dry for 50 to 80 consecutive days during the summer.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 35 percent in the A horizon and from 35 to 70 percent in the Bw horizon.  The base saturation is 75 percent or less in some parts or all of the upper 30 inches.\nThe A horzion has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  This horizon range from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 8 dry, and moist.  It ranges from gravelly loam or very gravelly loam to cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, or very gravelly silt loam.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral, and is 15 to 50 inches thick.\nThe C horizon where present has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6 dry and moist.  It ranges from very gravelly fine sandy loam, very gravelly sandy loam, or cobbly sandy loam to very gravelly loamy fine sand, very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly loam.  This horizon is medium acid to mildly alkaline."

Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in residuum and local alluvium weathered from sandstone and quartzite conglomerate.  The climate is moist subhumid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F., and the freeze-free period ranges from 60 to 80 days."
