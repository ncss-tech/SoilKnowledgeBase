  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are continuously saturated with saline water.  Soil salinity is greater than 16 mmhos/cm to a depth of 60 inches, and ranges from 8 to 16 mmhos/cm below 60 inches.  The n value of all mineral horizons to a depth of 40 inches or more is greater than 1.0, and ranges from 0.7 to 1.0 at depths of more than 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline throughout.  The mineral layers within the 10- to 40-inch control section have a clay content of 35 to 59 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; hue of 5Y, value of 2, chroma of 1 or 2; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1; or it is neutral, with value of 4 or less.  Texture is clay, clay loam, or mucky clay loam.  Few to common fragments of partly decomposed wood and leaves are present in this horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; hues of 5Y, 5GY, and 5BG, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1; hue of 5G, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2; or it is neutral with values of 4 or less.  Texture is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay to a depth of 40 inches or more.  Depth to textures of sandy loam, loamy fine sand, and fine sand range from 40 to 80 inches.  Some pedons have a 2C horizon with shell fragments below a depth of 60 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in the same family.  Closely related soils are the Barbary, Gentilly, Levy, Larose, Novato, Scatlake, Tatlum, and Turnbull series.  Barbary, Gentilly, Larose, and Scatlake soils have 60 percent or more clay in the fine-earth fraction and are thermic.  Levy and Novato soils have mixed mineralogy.  Addi- tionally, Levy soils have a pH less than 5.0 in 0.01 molar calcium throughout the control section and have a thermic temperature regime.  Novato soils are isomesic. Tatlum soils have a fine-silty control section, and mixed mineralogy.  Turnbull soils have a clayey substratum over sandy or sandy-skeletal material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mckee soils are in mangrove islands and tidal swamps, at or near sea level.  These soils formed in unconsolidated loamy or clayey tidal deposits.  Slopes range from 0 to 0.5 percent.  Near the type location, the mean annual rainfall is about 55 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Turnbull series, as well as the Kesson and St. Augustine series.  The Turnbull and Kesson series occur in tidal swamps and tidal flats.  Kesson soils formed in thick marine deposits of sand and shell fragments.  The St.  Augustine series are somewhat poorly drained and were formed be dredge and fill operations.  The materials from this operation were spread over the surface of former tidal areas, as well as mangrove islands along the Intracostal Waterway."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Mckee soils are very poorly drained.  Permeability is very slow in the upper part of the C horizon and moderate in the A and lower part of the C horizon.  They are continuously saturated.  Fluctuating tides overwash the surface twice daily."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Wetland wildlife habitat, sport and commercial finfish and shellfish and crustacean spawning grounds, and neutral erosion control during tropical storms.  Also, where accessible by elevated road or levee, these areas are well suited to beekeeping for mangrove honey production.  Vegetation is red, black and white mangrove, with some areas of saltwort, glasswort, seashore saltgrass, and seashore paspalum."
