These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following summer solstice. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 14 to 20 inches and includes part of the argillic horizon. Although dark colors extend below this depth, the organic matter content is below 1 percent. Base saturation is 50 to 72 percent throughout the upper 30 inches. The particle-size control section averages 22 to 33 percent clay in the fine earth fraction, 58 to 68 percent sand and 0 to 15 percent rock fragments. Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 3 percent in the Ap horizon. Depth to a very gravelly 3Btb horizon ranges from 25 to 60 inches.\nThe Ap horizon is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe AB horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist. It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam. It is strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist. It is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam. It is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe 2Btb and 3Btb horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. The upper part 3Btb horizon is very gravelly sandy clay or very gravelly sandy clay loam and the lower part is extremely gravelly sandy clay loam, extremely gravelly sandy clay or very gravelly sandy clay loam."
