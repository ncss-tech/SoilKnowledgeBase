Added soil moisture, soil temperature regime, mean annual soil temperature, and clay and sand particle size content to RIC. Added clay content, sand content,calcium carbonate equivalance, and reaction to horizon data in RIC. Updated competing series. Lowered mean annual air temperature from 14 to 13 degrees C based on climate data and added frost free days.  Updated geographically associated soils. Added flooding frequency. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters. Changed runoff to very low.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for typical pedon is from the Ellis County, Kansas Soil Survey, Issued August 1975. Additional laboratory data-- National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; pedons: 53KS141008 and 53KS141004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
