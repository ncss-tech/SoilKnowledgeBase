  "OVERVIEW": "The Munjor series consists of very deep well drained or moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains or low terraces in river valleys in the Rolling Plains and Breaks, MLRA 73. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C. (54 degrees F.), and mean annual precipitation is 580 millimeters (23 inches) at the type location.",

Added soil moisture, soil temperature regime, mean annual soil temperature, and clay and sand particle size content to RIC. Added clay content, sand content,calcium carbonate equivalance, and reaction to horizon data in RIC. Updated competing series. Lowered mean annual air temperature from 14 to 13 degrees C based on climate data and added frost free days.  Updated geographically associated soils. Added flooding frequency. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters. Changed runoff to very low."
