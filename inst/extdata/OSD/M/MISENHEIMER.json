  "OVERVIEW": "The Misenheimer series consists of shallow, moderately well drained, and somewhat poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from fine-grained metavolcanic rock.  During wet seasons these soils have perched water tables.  These soils are on nearly level to sloping broad ridges, in depressions and around the heads of drainageways in the Piedmont.  Mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 47 inches near the type location.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.",

Depth to hard fractured fine-grained metavolcanic rock is 20 to 40 inches or more.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in all horizons except where the surface has been limed.  The A, B, and C horizons average collectively 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is channery loam or channery silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is channery loam or channery silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is channery loam, channery silt loam or channery silty clay loam.  Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are throughout the horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, is multicolored channery silt loam or very channery silt loam.  It has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y.  The C horizon ranges from 25 to 60 percent of slate fragments.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored weathered and fractured slate with nearly level bedding planes.  It has 60 percent or more slate fragments.\nThe R horizon is fractured slate rock."

Badin, Nanford, and Tarrus soils are well drained and have a fine particle size class.  In addition, Nanford and Tarrus soils have a depth to paralithic contact with soft bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and Badin soils have a depth to paralithic contact with soft bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.

Misenheimer soils have perched water tables in wet seasons because the slate beds are nearly level and impede the downward movement of water."

Goldston soils are well drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone between the surface and depth of 7 inches.\nCambic horizon - The zone between depth of 7 and 14 inches.\nParalithic contact - The occurrence of soft bedrock at a depth of 14 inches.\nLithic contact - The occurence of hard bedrock at a depth of 25 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soils of the Misenheimer series were characterized as Goldston slaty silt loam, moderately well drained (S65NC-84-3(1-4) by the Beltsville Laboratory.
