  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is less than 20 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact with weathered fractured fine-grained metavolcanic  rock is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to hard fractured fine-grained metavolcanic rock is 20 to 40 inches or more.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in all horizons except where the surface has been limed.  The A, B, and C horizons average collectively 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is channery loam or channery silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is channery loam or channery silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is channery loam, channery silt loam or channery silty clay loam.  Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are throughout the horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, is multicolored channery silt loam or very channery silt loam.  It has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y.  The C horizon ranges from 25 to 60 percent of slate fragments.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored weathered and fractured slate with nearly level bedding planes.  It has 60 percent or more slate fragments.\nThe R horizon is fractured slate rock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known competing series in the same family.  Those in closely related families are Goldston and Kirksey series.  Goldston soils are well drained to excessively drained and loamy-skeletal.  Kirksey soils have fine-silty Bt horizons and bedrock below 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Misenheimer soils are on nearly level to gently sloping broad ridges, in depressions, and around the heads of drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from slates such as felsic argillites.  Mean annual precipitation is 47 inches and mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.  near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the closely related Goldston and Kirksey series, these are the Badin, Cid, Nanford, and Tarrus series.  Badin, Nanford, and Tarrus soils are well drained and have a fine particle size class.  In addition, Nanford and Tarrus soils have a depth to paralithic contact with soft bedrock at 40 to 60 inches and Badin soils have a depth to paralithic contact with soft bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are on more rolling topography.  Cid soils have a fine particle size control class and a depth to paralithic contact with soft bedrock at 20 to 40 inches."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained; runoff is slow and permeability is moderate to moderately rapid.  Misenheimer soils have perched water tables in wet seasons because the slate beds are nearly level and impede the downward movement of water."

    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included with the Goldston series.  Goldston soils are well drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone between the surface and depth of 7 inches.\nCambic horizon - The zone between depth of 7 and 14 inches.\nParalithic contact - The occurrence of soft bedrock at a depth of 14 inches.\nLithic contact - The occurence of hard bedrock at a depth of 25 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soils of the Misenheimer series were characterized as Goldston slaty silt loam, moderately well drained (S65NC-84-3(1-4) by the Beltsville Laboratory.
