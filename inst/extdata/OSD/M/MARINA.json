  "OVERVIEW": "The Marina series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in old eolian deposits. Marina soils are on fluviomarine terraces, marine terraces, and coastal plains and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.",
