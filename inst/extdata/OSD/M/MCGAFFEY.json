  "OVERVIEW": "The McGaffey series consists of very deep, drained, formed in calcareous alluvium on reddish shale, siltstone and fine grained sandstone, such as the Chinle and Abo formations. These soils occur on alluvial fans and valley floors. Slopes are 5 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mostly on gently sloping alluvial fans of gradient less than 3 percent. The McGaffey series is of loamy alluvial soils of cool-temperate sub-humid environment developing in calcareous reddish alluvium.  In the Zuni Mountains of New Mexico these soils occupy alluvial fans and valley floors at elevations of about 7,500 feet within uplands formed on reddish shale, siltstone and fine grained sandstone, such as the Chinle and Abo formations.  The climate is continental with mean annual precipitation ranging from about 18 to 20 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F.; mean July temperature, about 65 degrees F.; mean annual temperature, about 47 degrees F.  The McGaffey soils are the most extensive soils on the alluvial plains and fans, and probably the most productive soils of the Zuni Mountain Area."
