  "OVERVIEW": "The Maginnis series is a member of the clayey-skeletal, montmorillonitic family of Lithic Haploborolls.  Typically, Maginnis soils have grayish brown very channery clay loam A1 horizons that rest on fractured hard phyllitic shale and platy sandstone at a depth of about 16 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Maginnis soils have mean annual soil temperature ranging from 41 degrees to 47 degrees F. and average summer temperature ranging from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Depth to the R1 layer ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and value of 5 through 3 dry.  It is cobbly or channery clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Shale or sandstone fragments make up 50 to 90 percent of the volume below a depth of about 4 inches.  Thin coatings of lime occur in some crevices and under some plates in the bedrock substrata."

The climate is cool, moist, semiarid with a mean annual temperature of 40 degrees to 45 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranging from 14 to 18 inches.  Mean summer temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 65 degrees F.  Mean winter temperature ranges from 20 degrees to 25 degrees F."
