    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Maginnis soils have mean annual soil temperature ranging from 41 degrees to 47 degrees F. and average summer temperature ranging from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.  Depth to the R1 layer ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and value of 5 through 3 dry.  It is cobbly or channery clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Shale or sandstone fragments make up 50 to 90 percent of the volume below a depth of about 4 inches.  Thin coatings of lime occur in some crevices and under some plates in the bedrock substrata."
