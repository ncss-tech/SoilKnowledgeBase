  "OVERVIEW": "The Maryrussell series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous mineralogy. Maryrussell soils are on paleoterraces and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Maryrussell soils form in a plateau climate.",
