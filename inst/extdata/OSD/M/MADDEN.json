Madden soils are on mountain sideslopes and ridges and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sedimentary or serpentinitic rock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to be 50 to 59 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 4 and 12 inches is usually dry in all parts from mid-June to mid-October and moist in all parts from November to April.  The base saturation is 75 to 95 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 5/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4.  Moist colors are 5YR 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/2.  It is loam or clay loam with 5 to 15 percent gravel.  It is neutral or slightly acid.  Where dry values of 5 and moist values of 3 occur, the surface horizons are too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon.\nThe B2t horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 10YR 4/4, 5/4.  Moist colors are 5YR 3/4; 7.5YR 4/4; 10YR 3/3.  It is heavy clay loam or clay.  It has sufficient clay increase to qualify for an argillic horizon.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline."
