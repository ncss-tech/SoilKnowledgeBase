  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the platy duripan ranges from 51 to 102 cm.  The soil is usually dry in all parts from about May 15 to November 15, and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time, aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric.  The soil temperature is above 5 degrees C about from April 1 to December 20, and is above 8.3 degrees C from about April 15 to November 30.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 56 F.  Fine and medium pumice gravel covers 15 to 50 percent of the soil surface.  Ash content is 60 to 90 percent by weight.  The dry bulk density of the soil ranges from 1.1 to 1.25 g/cc and the moist bulk density is 1.3 to 1.45 g/cc, excluding the Cq horizon.  The soil is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2 or 7/3, and moist color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Gravel content of the A2 horizon ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  This is mostly pumice and obsidian.  Organic carbon content is 0.2 to 0.4 percent.\nThe C and 3C horizon have dry color of 10YR 6/4, 7/2, 7/3 or 8/2 and moist color of 10YR 4/4, 5/2, 6/2 or 6/3.  Textures are loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.  Some durinodes may be present in the 3C horizon.  Gravel content ranges from 5 to 35 percent.\nThe Cqk horizon is platy and fractured.  Thickness ranges from 25 to 76 cm.  Consistence is quite variable and pockets of loamy sand are present between fractured duripan lenses.  A 1 to 3 mm thick opal cap is present.  Carbonate is absent in some profiles."

The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 cm.  Mean January temperature is about 0 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 21 degrees C; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 125 to 150 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 18 cm (A1, A2).\n1.1  The organic carbon percentage is estimated at 0.2 percent.\n1.2  Color values for the A horizon do not meet mollic criteria (10YR 6/2).\nOther Soil Characteristics:\n1.  Duripan\n1.1  Dry fragments do not slake in water or 1N HCL\n1.2  Silica coatings rarely visible\n1.3  Fracture spacing averages 15 cm or more\n1.4  Does not have an indurated subhorizon.  This places soil in Haploxerollic subgroup.  Some durinodes are present.\n2.  The soil moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric; 20 to 25 cm M.A.P. (see graph below).\n3.  The soil temperature regime is mesic.  M.A.S.T. is 11.1 to 13.3 degrees C.  This is extrapolated from actual temperature transect data over the past years using Rod Arkley's equation.\n4.  Ashy family because more than 60 percent of the soil is volcanic ash and pumice gravel.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
