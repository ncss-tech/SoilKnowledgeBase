  "OVERVIEW": "The Moppet series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils which are moderately deep to sand.  They formed in loamy alluvium underlain by sandy alluvium on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid in the sandy substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum, thickness of the loamy mantle, and depth to sandy alluvium all range from 24 to 40 inches.  Organic matter content shows an irregular decrease with depth.  Rock fragments typically are absent in the loamy mantle.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the sandy alluvium.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid to a depth of 30 inches and from extremely acid to neutral below 30 inches.  Redox accumulations are within a depth of 40 inches. Saturation occurs at 30 to 40 inches at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  Typically it has thin strata of coarser or finer texture.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  Typically it has thin strata of coarser or finer texture.  Organic carbon content ranges from .3 to .6 percent.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or the gravelly analogs or is startified with these textures. Some pedons have thin strata of finer texture.\nThe 2C horizon has hue off 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 do not occur together.  The 2C horizon has texture like the 2BC horizon."

These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.5 to 3.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period September to June in 6 or more out of 10 years.  These soils are subject to occasional very brief flooding mostly from September to June."
