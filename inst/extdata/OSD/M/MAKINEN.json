    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Makinen soils are in shallow closed depressions primarily on outwash plains and lake plains, but can occur on end moraines and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Makinen soils formed in herbaceous organic materials underlain by sandy deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 813 cm (30 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 9.4 degrees C (47 to 49 degrees F). Elevation is 183 to 305 meters (600 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to (1 foot) below the surface between September and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is very low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic materials and high or very high in the sand deposits. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic materials and rapid in the sandy deposits."
