  "OVERVIEW": "The Makinen series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, extremely acid soils in depressions on outwash plains, lake plains, ground moraines, and end moraines. The soils formed in herbaceous organic materials underlain by sandy deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
