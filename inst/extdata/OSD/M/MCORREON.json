  "REVDATE": "11/2006",
  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mcorreon series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian, alluvium, and slope alluvium over residuum derived from basalt.  Mcorreon soils are on summits of basalt capped mesas and plateaus. Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
