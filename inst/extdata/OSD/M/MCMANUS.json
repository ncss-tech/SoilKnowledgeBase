  "OVERVIEW": "The Mcmanus series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, and glacial outwash plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
