  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 38 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is in excess of 60 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 13 to 30 inches and commonly ranges widely within a distance of 20 feet. Distinct soft iron masses with chroma higher than that of the matrix are in the B horizon within depths of 12 inches. The B horizon above the fragipan contain between 8 and 18 percent clay. Rock fragments exclusive of shale that disperses upon mechanical analysis range from 1 to 25 percent by volume in the part of the solum above the fragipan and from 5 to 30 percent in the fragipan and C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5 Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2. Typically the texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam, and commonly is low in rock fragments. Some pedons in uncleared areas have a thin layer under the A horizon that could qualify as a spodic materials, and locally remnants of this remain below the Ap horizon. Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid\nSome pedons have a BE horizon below the Ap.\nThe B or Bw horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Redoximorphic features consisting of concentrations of iron/manganese oxides or iron depletions occur above depths of 12 inches. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Structure ranges from weak granular to very weak fine and medium blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable. Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe 2E horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4, and contains common to many redoximorphic concentrations of higher chroma. Texture of the fine earth fraction is sandy loam or loam. Structure is weak platy or blocky or it is massive. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe 2Bx horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Few to many redoximorphic concentrations of higher chroma are present. Texture of the fine earth fraction is fine sandy loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate very coarse prismatic. Consistence is firm or very firm and is brittle. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral. Clay films are common in pores but are few or lacking on ped faces. Dark, friable shale fragments are conspicuous. The fragipan is not consistently as firm as that of most Fragiudepts, but it inhibits water movement and root growth.\nThe 2BC horizon has a hue of 10YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth fraction. It has platy structure, plate-like divisions, or it is massive. Consistence is typically friable or firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 1 through 4. It is fine sandy loam or loam. It has plate-like divisions, or it is massive. Consistence is typically firm, but can be very firm. Dark, friable shale fragments are conspicuous. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have slight or strong effervescence in the lower part. (Some pedons have been designated Cd. This is in question.)"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mosherville soils are on till plains. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The regolith is till from granite, gneiss, sandstone, and a significant component of fragments of weakly consolidated dark shale in the lower horizons. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation from 35 to 50 inches, and mean growing season from 130 to 150 days."

Presently they would become part of the Broadalbin series.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon);\n2) Cambic horizon - from 9 to 13 inches (Bw horizon);\n3) Fragipan horizon - from 13 to 42 inches (2Bx horizon);\n4) Redoximorphic Features - iron and clay depletions and iron concentrations (Bw and 2Bx horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
