  "OVERVIEW": "The Mirabal series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapid permeable soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granite.  Mirabal soils are on igneous domes in mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
