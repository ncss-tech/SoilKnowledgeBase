  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to a paralithic contact at the upper boundary of the Cr horizon ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to a lithic contact with hard bedrock is more than 60 inches. The soil is very strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon and strongly acid to neutral in the B and C horizons. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the A and B horizons and from 0 to 40 percent in the C horizon Content of mica flakes is few or common throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. A horizons that have value of 3 or less are less than 7 inches thick. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. In moderately eroded pedons, this horizon has colors similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6, or may be mottled in these colors. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. Rock fragment content is usually more in the BC horizon than in the Bw horizon of the same pedon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6, or it is multicolored. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. The C horizon is saprolite weathered from mixed felsic and mafic, high-grade metamorphic rock such as migmatitic gneiss, biotite-hornblende gneiss, and amphibolite.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, multicolored, mixed felsic and mafic, high-grade metamorphic rock such as migmatitic gneiss, biotite-hornblende gneiss, and amphibolite. It is partially consolidated, but can be dug with difficulty with hand tools. The upper boundary is considered as a paralithic contact where root spacing is greater than 4 inches.\nThe R horizon, where present, is hard, mixed felsic and mafic, high-grade metamorphic rock such as migmatitic gneiss, biotite-hornblende gneiss, and amphibolite."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Todthill (T) and Walnut (T) series in the same family, and the Herkimer, Lowville, Oteen, Pittsfield, Reger, Stockbridge, and Urne series in closely related families. Todthill soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Walnut soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to paralithic contact. Herkimer soils are more than 40 inches deep and form in alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, and calcareous shale. Lowville soils are more than 60 inches deep and form in glacial till and aeolian material. Oteen soils are shallow to a paralithic contact. Pittsfield and Stockbridge soils are more than 60 inches deep and form in calcareous glacial till. Reger soils form in sandstone, siltstone, and shale and contain fragments of those rocks. Urne soils are somewhat excessively drained and contain glauconite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mars Hill soils are strongly sloping to very steep and are on ridgetops and side slopes in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). Elevations range from about 1600 to 3500 feet. The slope gradient commonly is 15 to 50 percent but ranges from 8 to 95 percent. They form in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part and weathered from mixed felsic and mafic, high-grade metamorphic rocks such as migmatitic gneiss, biotite-hornblende gneiss, and amphibolite. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 30 to 45 inches. The frost-free season ranges from about 128 to 156 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the competing Oteen and Walnut(T) soils, and the Chestnut, Cowee, Edneyville, Evard, and Tate soils. None of these soils except Oteen and Walnut(T) have base saturation of 60 percent or more in any horizon between 10 and 30 inches, unless they have been limed. In addition, Cowee, Evard, and Tate soils have an argillic horizon. All these soils except for Tate are on mountain ridgetops and side slopes. Tate is on colluvial footslopes, fans and benches. The Oteen and Walnut(T) soils are associated locally on the mountain landscape with Mars Hill soils."

Common trees include eastern white pine, Virginia pine, shortleaf pine, white oak, chestnut oak, black oak, and hickory. Mountain laurel, flowering dogwood, sourwood, and eastern red cedar are common in the understory. A small acreage is used for small grain and burley tobacco."

A dominance of the soils mapped Mars Hill have a cambic horizon and have more than 60 percent base saturation by NH4OAc in some horizon between 10 inches and 30 inches. The 8/01 revision updates classification and places this series in a superactive CEC activity class based upon NSSL Pedon 91P0224.\nDiagnostic horizons and diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in the typical pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 9 inches (Ap1 and Ap2 horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 35 inches below the surface (Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons)\nParalithic contact - the contact with weathered bedrock at a depth of 46 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSelected NSSL data: NH4OAc\nHorizon Depth(in) Sand Silt Clay pH 1:1H2O Base Sat.%CEC7\n------- --------- ---- ---- ---- ---------- --------\nBw1 9 - 16 57.1 26.6 16.3 6.0 66\nBw2 16 - 23 64.5 21.5 14.0 5.8 69\nBC 23 - 35 73.8 18.5 7.7 5.5 73\nC 35 - 46 70.7 21.6 7.7 5.5 89\nMLRA: 130 SIR: NC0290\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
