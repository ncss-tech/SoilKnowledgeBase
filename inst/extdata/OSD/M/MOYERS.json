  "OVERVIEW": "The Moyers series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on very gently sloping to gently sloping uplands in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.",

Texture is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly or medium acid.\nThe B1 horizon has hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values that range from 4 to 6, and chromas that range from 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and ranges from 25 to 40 percent clay content.  Reaction ranges from slightly to very strongly acid. Some pedons have brown mottles.\nThe B21t horizon has similar color and reaction as the B1 horizon.  This horizon has red, gray and brown mottles.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam and clay content ranges from 35 to 40 percent.\nThe B22t horizon has hues of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; values that range from 4 to 6 and chromas that range from 4 to 6.  It has red, gray and brown mottles.  Texture is clay or clay loam and clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Cr horizon is olive or gray shale that is slightly weathered and can be dug with a spade with some difficulty.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline.  It is tilted 20 degrees to 60 degrees from the horizontal."
