  "OVERVIEW": "The Mazie series consists of very deep, very poorly drained  soils on flood plains and bottomlands.  They formed in material weathered from mixed alluvium.  Permeability is slow.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
