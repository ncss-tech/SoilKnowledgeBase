These soils formed in material weathered from mixed alluvium.  Elevations range from 2800 to 3000 feet.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F, average annual precipitation is 40 to 45 inches, and frost-free season is from 80 to 110 days."

Pokey soils are along drainageways, and are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and somewhat poorly drained.  Sly soils are on higher terraces and are well drained."
