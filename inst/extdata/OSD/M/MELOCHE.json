  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is about 66 degrees F.  The solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches thick.  Interbedded sandstone and shale occur at a depth of  more than 40 inches.  Surface cover of rock fragments ranges from 30 to 80 percent with stones making up about 40 percent, cobbles about 40 percent, and pebbles about 20 percent.  The soil moisture control section is dry in some part for more than 90 cumulative days in most years, but it is not dry in all parts more than 1/2 of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches.  The A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 35 percent.  This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline.  The B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.  It is clay, silty clay, or clay loam with 35 to 60 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent pebbles and cobbles.  This horizon ranges from noncalcareous in the upper part to strongly calcareous in the lower part.  It is mildly to moderately alkaline.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5YR.  It is clay, silty clay, or clay loam.  Shale fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and increase with increasing depth."

Bagley, Jacques, Lane and Rune soils have mollic epipedons 20 or more inches thick.  Buffington soils lack a cambric horizon.  Colmor and Ulysses soils have a fine, silty control section.  Thurloni soils have hue redder than 7.5YR and a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Meloche soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 7,000 to 8,500 feet.  Slopes range from 15 to 55 percent.  The soils formed mostly in fine textured colluvial deposits from shale, sandstone, igneous rocks.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 66 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 66 degrees F.  The annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches with about 70 percent falling during the frost free period."
