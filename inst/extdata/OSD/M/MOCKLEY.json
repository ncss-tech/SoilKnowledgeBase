Classification was changed from thermic to hyperthermic during update of January 2001 due to results of a soil temperature study. Classification change, dated September 1997, from Clayey, mixed, thermic Plinthic Paleudults to Fine, kaolinitic, thermic Plinthic Paledults based on advances in soil taxonomy (Clayey no longer used in Ultisols), and results from reference sampling of three pedons from Austin County, Texas.  This soil was formerly included in the Hockley series.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Mineralogy data available from Texas A & M University Soil Characterization Lab on sample S96TX-089-002.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
