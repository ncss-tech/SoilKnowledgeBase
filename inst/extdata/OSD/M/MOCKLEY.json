  "OVERVIEW": "The Mockley series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Willis Formation. These very gently sloping soils occur on low hills on coastal plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 in).",

Classification was changed from thermic to hyperthermic during update of January 2001 due to results of a soil temperature study. Classification change, dated September 1997, from Clayey, mixed, thermic Plinthic Paleudults to Fine, kaolinitic, thermic Plinthic Paledults based on advances in soil taxonomy (Clayey no longer used in Ultisols), and results from reference sampling of three pedons from Austin County, Texas.  This soil was formerly included in the Hockley series."
