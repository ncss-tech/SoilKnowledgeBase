  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Millan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from quartzite with admixtures of limestone and granitic rocks. The Millan soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
