These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.55 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent, and 5 to 35 percent pumice 2.0 to 5.0 mm in diameter.  Hard rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  Depth to bedrock or dense glacial till is 40 to 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and moist.  Texture is paragravelly ashy sandy loam or paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  Texture is paragravelly ashy sandy loam or  paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a very cobbly loamy sand glacial till 2C horizon at 40 to 60 inches.
