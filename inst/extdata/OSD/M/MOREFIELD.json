  "OVERVIEW": "The Morefield series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone.  Morefield soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
