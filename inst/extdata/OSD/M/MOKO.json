Cracks are up to 10 inches deep, 1/2 to 2 inches wide, and 2 to 5 feet apart are filled with A material.\nNote: The particle size control section averages from 18 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent rock fragments.\nA horizon\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 or 2\nFine-earth: silt loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam\nTotal rock fragments: 35 to 90 percent gravel, cobbles, channers, flagstones, or stones\nNote: Individual horizons may contain less than 35 percent rock fragments.\nReaction: moderately acid to moderately alkaline\nThe R horizon consists of hard, level bedded limestone or dolostone that is commonly fractured, at least in the upper part.  Cracks up to 10 inches deep, 1/2 to 2 inches wide, and 2 to 5 feet apart are filled with A material.  Chert occurs as thin beds, or as nodules in the limestone and dolomite.  The amount of chert varies both vertically and laterally."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moko soils are on gently sloping to very steep dissected uplands.  Slopes range from 3 to 100 percent.  Moko soils formed in loamy colluvium or residuum from limestone of the Boone Formation; dolomites of the Cotter and Jefferson City formations and interbedded limestones of the Everton formation in Arkansas and counterparts in Missouri. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 53 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 42 to 46 inches."

Agnos, Arkana, Blueye, Estate, Gassville and Gepp soils occur on similar landscapes. All are deeper than 20 inches to bedrock and have argillic horizons. Portia soils occur on lower footslopes positions.  Portia soils are deeper than 20 inches to bedrock and has an argillic horizon."
