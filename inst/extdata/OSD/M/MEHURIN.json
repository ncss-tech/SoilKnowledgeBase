  "OVERVIEW": "The Mehurin series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in calcareous glacial till.  These soils are in concave foot slopes and level to very gently sloping areas on moraines.  The permeability is moderately slow or slow in the upper part and moderately slow or moderate in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches thick and extends into the upper part of the Bt horizon in some pedons.  The volume of rock fragments typically ranges from 1 to 8 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It dominantly is clay loam or loam but includes silty clay loam in some pedons.  The reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay, or clay averaging 35 to 60 percent clay.  The reaction dominantly is neutral or slightly acid, but slightly alkaline in the lower part is within the range.  Distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are present.  Clay films range from common to many in the upper part and common to few in the lower part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Faint to prominent mottles are present.  Secondary lime accumulations range from few to many.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Distinct or prominent mottles are present."
