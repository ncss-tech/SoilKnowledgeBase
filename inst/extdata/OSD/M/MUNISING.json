  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 34 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 15 to 25 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 1 to 10 percent and volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.  The total content of rock fragments is less than 10 percent throughout the profile.  Stones range from 0 to 2 percent throughout the pedon.  The solum is very strongly acid to moderately acid and the C horizon is moderately acid to slightly acid.\nCultivated areas have a dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) Ap horizon 6 to 10 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR,  10YR or is neutral; value of 2 through 4; and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 5 or 6. The A and E horizons are loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizon has value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 3 to 6.  The Bhs and Bs horizons are fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR .  It is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nThe Ex horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe (B/E)x horizon is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Colors are similar to the Bx and Ex horizons.  The fragipan horizons are very hard or extremely hard when dry and very firm to extremely firm when moist.  Faint to distinct redoximorphic features are in the upper part of the fragipan as a result of impeded drainage.\nSome pedons have an (E/B)x horizon with colors and textures similar to the (B/E)x.  The presence and arrangement of the fragipan horizons is variable but at least one fragipan layer is present in all pedons of the Munising series\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  In pedons where a separate Bt horizon is absent, at least one of the fragipan horizons also meet the requirements for an argillic horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R, 2.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are none currently.  The Graveraet and Steuben soils need to be reclassified and will compete in the future.  The closely related Argonne, Gogebic, Kallio, Wabeno and Wakefield soils are in the superactive clay activity class.  Argonne and Wabeno soils have hues yellower than 5YR in the lower solum and substratum.  Gogebic soils have greater than 10 percent rock fragments throughout.  Graveraet soils have less acid substratums.  Kallio soils contain more than 15 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the solum and contain more than 20 percent clay in the substratum..  Steuben soils have sand C horizons within a depth of 40 inches.  Wakefield soils contain more than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Munising soils are on nearly level to steep areas on ground and end moraines of Wisconsinan age. The Munising soils have formed in sandy loam till derived from Jacobsville sandstone. Slope gradients are dominantly 2 to 12 percent but range from 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 33 inches, and mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F."

The well drained Frohling, somewhat poorly drained Skanee soils and poorly drained Gay soils form a drainage sequence with Munising soils. The well drained Keweenaw soils formed in loamy sand and do not have a fragipan.  Well drained Onota and moderately well drained Abbaye soils have sandstone bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. The moderately well drained Yalmer and well drained Tokiahok soils have sandy spodic horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
