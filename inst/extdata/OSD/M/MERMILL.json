  "OVERVIEW": "The Mermill series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils on lake plains and till plains. They formed in loamy glaciolacustrine or water-sorted material 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and in the underlying till. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days.

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy material and moderately low or low in the underlying till. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and slow or very slow in the underlying till."

Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest with swamp white oak, bur oak, pin oak, elm, hickory, and ash."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Some acreage of the Mermill series is being converted to the Alvada and Aurand series during modernization projects. The previous Mermill series concept allowed for fine-textured lacustrine sediments in the 2B and 2C horizons. A new series will be established to address these soils during modernization projects in MLRA 99. An evaluation of existing lab data supports the redefinition of the clay content in the till.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 91 cm (Btg, 2Btg horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 23 cm.\nRepresentative data mapunit is DMU ID 130014 in MO 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
