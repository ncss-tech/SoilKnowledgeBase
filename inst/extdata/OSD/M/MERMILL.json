  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mermill soils are on lake plains, and less commonly on till plains of late Wisconsinan age. They have a plane or concave surface with a slope gradient of 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy glaciolacustrine or water-sorted material and in the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aurand, Haskins, Houcktown, and Rawson soils. These soils form a toposequence with Mermill soils. The somewhat poorly drained Aurand and Haskins soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. The moderately well drained Houcktown and the well drained Rawson soils are on higher or more sloping landscape positions."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between December and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy material and moderately low or low in the underlying till. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and slow or very slow in the underlying till."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of the Mermill soils have been drained and are used for cropland. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, oats, wheat, alfalfa, tomatoes, and sugar beets. Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest with swamp white oak, bur oak, pin oak, elm, hickory, and ash."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Some acreage of the Mermill series is being converted to the Alvada and Aurand series during modernization projects. The previous Mermill series concept allowed for fine-textured lacustrine sediments in the 2B and 2C horizons. A new series will be established to address these soils during modernization projects in MLRA 99. An evaluation of existing lab data supports the redefinition of the clay content in the till.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 23 to 91 cm (Btg, 2Btg horizons).\nAquic conditions: redox features in all horizons below a depth of 23 cm.\nRepresentative data mapunit is DMU ID 130014 in MO 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
