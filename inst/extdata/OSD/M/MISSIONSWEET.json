  "OVERVIEW": "The Missionsweet series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from igneous rock. Missionsweet soils are on sideslopes of fan remnants. Slopes range from 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
