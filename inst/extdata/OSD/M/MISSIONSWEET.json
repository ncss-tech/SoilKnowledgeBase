    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Missionsweet soils are on sideslopes of fan remnants. Slopes range from 8 to 30 percent. These soils formed in alluvium from igneous rock. Elevations range from 470 to 780 meters (1,542 to 2,558 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches); mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F), and the frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Carpetflat soils have a loamy particle-size control section above the duripan. Friedliver and Oldale soils have coarse-loamy and loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections, respectively, have an argillic horizon and do not have a duripan. Carrizo soils are in drainageways, are very deep, have a sandy-skeletal particle-size control section and do not have a duripan."
