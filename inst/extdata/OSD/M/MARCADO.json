  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 70 to more than 80 inches.  Clay content of the control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent.  In the summer, cracks at least 0.5 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of greater than 30 inches.  Low chroma colors in the argillic horizon are assumed to be relict.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, and red are few to common.  Pitted concretions of calcium carbonate commonly begin at depths of 20 inches, and range from none to 10 percent of the soil matrix.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, and red are few to common.  Pitted concretions of calcium carbonate make up less than 10 percent of the soil matrix.  In some pedons, a few fine gypsum crystals are in the lower part.  Reaction is moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marcado soils are on slopes bordering streams and rivers.  Slopes range form 3 to 8 percent.  Marcado soils formed on erosional surfaces of clayey and loamy sediments of Pleistocene age.  Most of the sediments were previously weathered under upland soils with aquic moisture regimes. Mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 72 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 44 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 52 to 62. Elevation ranges from 30 to 150 feet and frost free period from 260 to 290 days."

Edna, Dacosta, and Telferner soils have aquic moisture regimes and occur on adjacent uplands.  Ganado, Chicolete, and Navidad soils are frequently flooded and occur on adjacent bottomlands.  Milby and Kuy soils occur on similar positions, and have thick, sandy epipedons."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Marcado soils were formerly included with the Dacosta and Edna series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 8 inches\nHigh shrink - swell potential in the Bt, Btk, and BCk horizons.\nArgillic horizon - the zone from approximately 8 to 40 inches.\nCalcic horizon - 40 to 80 inches.\nUdic moisture regime - these soils are well within the climatic zone normally considered as Udic moisture regime, but secondary forms of calcium carbonate are at depths associated with an ustic moisture regime.  They are dry less than 60 consecutive or 90 cumulative days."
