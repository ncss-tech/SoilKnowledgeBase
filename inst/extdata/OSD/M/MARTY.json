  "OVERVIEW": "The Marty series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived mainly from quartz diorite or other coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock types. Marty soils occur on broad ridges and steep side slopes of mountains. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. The solum and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. The rock fragments range from 10 to 25 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 0 to 30 percent in the lower part. Below 5 feet rock fragments increase to 50 percent. The particle-size control section has moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 grams per cubic centimeter,  an estimated phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, and more than 2.0 cmol per kg fine earth of 1N KCL extractable aluminum. It is slightly to moderately smeary throughout. Reaction is strongly to very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist.  Chroma of 3 are limited to the upper 9 inches of the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry. Texture ranges from heavy loam to clay loam with field estimated clay of 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 6 or greater moist and dry. It ranges from heavy loam to clay loam with a field estimated clay content of 22 to 35 percent clay."

The soils formed in very deep, moderately fine textured colluvium or locally transported material derived from quartz diorite or other coarse-grained intrusive igneous rock types. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 120 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon\nCambic horizon - from 21 to 34 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons).\nAndic properties - from 0 to 46 inches (A1, A2, BA, Bw1, Bw2 horizons).  Below a depth of 46 inches, andic soil properties are absent primarily due to reduced organic matter and higher bulk density.\nParticle-size control section - from 0 to 40 inches.\nClassification revised 3/92 from Medial mesic Andic Dystrochrepts based on the Andisol Order.\nThe Marty soil competes with the Murtip and Tolany series based on the new classification. With the combining of the Benton County Area, Oregon and part of the Alsea Area, Oregon soil survey, into the Benton County, Oregon update soil survey, the Marty series has been correlated to the Murtip series.  Field observations and documentation support this correlation decision. As a result, the official series type location has been moved to the Polk County.  The Marty soil will need further investigation during the MLRA A1 update project to validate the series concept.   Field observations and documentation from transects and traverses in Polk County have shown that the Marty soil is mapped within the mesic soil temperature regime and not the frigid regime as it is currently classified.  To date, findings in Polk County, as part of the MLRA 1 update, support a correlation of the Marty series to the Murtip soils.\nThe Marty series cannot be separated adequately from the Tolany soil. The Marty series should ultimately be inactivated.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first minaral layer.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
