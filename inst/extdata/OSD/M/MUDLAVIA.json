  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudlavia series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified gravelly and sandy outwash. Mudlavia soils formed in gravelly clayey outwash on terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
