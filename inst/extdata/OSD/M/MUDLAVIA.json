The well drained Eldean soils contain less rock fragments and are on adjacent terraces on different elevations. The well drained Ockley and Oshtemo soils have less clay and rock fragments in the subsoil and are on adjacent terraces on different elevations. The excessively drained Rodman soils have sola less than 20 inches thick, have less clay in the subsoil and are on steeper breaks of the terrace."
