Aspetill soils have mean summer soil temperature of 8.3 to 11.1 degrees C. and are dominated by cobbles in the particle-size control section.  Badwater soils have 25 to 35 percent clay and are dominated by boulders in the particle-size control section.  Bickmore, Bluebell, Buena Vista, Hawkinspeak, Littlemud, Rutherford, and Woodhurst soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Booneville soils have mean annual soil temperature of 2.2 to 4.4 degrees C.  Dab soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section.  Dailybasin soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Delhew soils have less than 18 percent clay, are dominated by fine gravel (2 to 5 mm diameter) in the particle-size control section, and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Keman soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 3.9 to 5.6 degrees C.  Lostcannon soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Parkalley soils have the base of the argillic horizon between 28 and 35 inches from the soil surface and are dominated by flagstones.  Parkay soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Redbird soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates within 100 cm of the soil surface.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Monibasin soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on footslope positions.  They formed in slope alluvium derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,290 to 2,595 meters.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 400 to 600 mm, the mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 86 cm (A1, A2, A3, and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 38 to 152 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 38 to 88 cm (Bt1 horizon and part of the Bt2 horizon).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic Pachic Argicryolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
