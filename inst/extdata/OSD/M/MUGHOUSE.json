  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually noncalcareous through except that very thin, discontinuous, weakly calcareous subhorizons occur just above the bedrock in some pedons.  Depth to the lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  ESP either remains constant or increases with depth, and ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum.  A majority of the subhorizons above the bedrock have hue of 7.5YR or yellower, although a few subhorizons are redder than 7.5YR in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and any C horizon above the bedrock and are mainly 10 to 24 inches in diameter and are mostly flat flagstones.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons.  This horizon is heavy clay loam or light clay but ranges in clay from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 5 to 45 percent, and sand from 15 to 55 percent with more than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye)."

Rencalson, Renohill, and Winklo soils have a paralithic contacts at depths of less than 40 inches.\nArp soils have hue of 5YR or redder in a majority of subhorizons above the bedrock and have less than 15 percent rock fragments, mainly gravel and cobbles in the control section.\nBessemer soils have a loamy-skeletal substratum at depths of 11 to 20inches.\nFalfa soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt and below.\nMughut soils are dry in some parts of the moisture control section more than 90 cumulative days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more.  Mughut soils also have soil temperatures of 41 degrees F. or more for less than 210 days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mughouse soils are on gently to moderately sloping mesa tops, hills, and ridges.  Slopes typically range from 2 to 12 percent or more.  The soils formed in moderately thin, moderately fine to fine textured, noncalcareous materials weathered in plasce from interbedded sandstone and shale with a base of hard sandstone occurring at depth of less than 40 inches.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches with nearly equal amounts of precipitation in all months.  Mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  and mean summer temperature is 70 degrees F."
