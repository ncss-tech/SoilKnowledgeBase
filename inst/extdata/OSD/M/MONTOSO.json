  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 9 to 20 inches.  Depth to the cinders ranges from 12 to 32 inches.  Cinders and clinkers cover 30 to 90 percent of the surface.  Soil temperatures range from 47 to 59 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist in 1/2 or more years in some part of the moisture control section (not necessarily the same part) during the period the soil temperature at 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F. unless irrigated.  The drier periods occur between early October and late May.  The solum ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline and from noncalcareous to slightly calcareous.  The A and B horizons have hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B2t horizon ranges from heavy loam and heavy silt loam to clay loam and silty clay loam.  The C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR.  Organic matter content decreases rapidly in the C1 horizon and is less than 1.0 percent.  The C horizon ranges from noncalcareous in the upper part to calcareous in the lower part."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  These are the Bandera, Irock, Los Alamos, Majada and Salas soils.  Bandera soils lack argillic horizons and have mean annual soil temperatures below 47 degrees F.  Los Alamos soils have ochric epipedons and average less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Irock and Majada soils have sola thicker than 20 inches and lack the dominating influence of cinders in the control section.  Salas soils have schist bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Montoso soils are on gently sloping to steep cinder cones and hills at about 6,000 to 7,600 feet elevation in the pinyon juniper vegetation type.  The soils formed in material that weathered chiefly from cinders and that is highly variable in color.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The precipitation pattern has a marked summer maximum."
