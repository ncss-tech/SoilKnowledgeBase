  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is about 51 degrees F. Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Mottling within the control section is usually very weak or absent but in some pedons there are mottles inherited from the parent beds and are not indicative of present drainage.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in a major part of the solum and C horizon above the bedrock and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically gravelly loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam but averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 60 percent silt, and 15 to 70 percent sand.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline."

The soil formed in thin noncalcareous medium to moderately fine textured materials weathered from sedimentary bedrock.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer. Mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 52 degrees F."
