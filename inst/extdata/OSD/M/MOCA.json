  "OVERVIEW": "The Moca series consists of very, deep moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in clayey materials overlaying a basal conglomerate of clay, gravel and cobbles.  They are sloping and steep soils on foot slopes and side slopes of low hills in the humid uplands.  Slopes range from 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 27 to 43 inches.  Thickness of the argillic horizon varies from 23 to 35 inches.  Texture is clay throughout the profile.  Consistence in the solum is slightly sticky or sticky and plastic.  Reaction ranges from strongly to extremely acid in the whole profile.  Cracks occur throughout the B horizon.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 75 to 80 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hues of 5YR or 7.5YR, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Structure is weak, fine or medium subangular blocky.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Bt horizons have red, brown, and grayish brown colors in varying proportions.  Structure is weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky.  Clay films range from few faint to many prominent.  Pressure faces may occur in any portion of the argillic horizon. Slickensides may or may not be present.\nThe C horizons have gray colors with varing proportions of red and reddish yellow.  Varying amounts of gravel may be present in this horizon."

The Consejo, Consumo, Corozal, Corozo, Ingenio, Jagueyes, Lirios, Maricao, Patillas and Rio Piedras series are similar soils in related families.  The Consejo, Liros and Rio Piedras all lack horizons with COLE value of 0.09 or more.  The Consumo and Maricao soils have thinner argillic horizons.  The Corozal soils have low chroma mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  The Corozo soils have sandy surface layers.  The Ingenio and Jagueyes soils have lower CEC values, less than 24 meq/100 grams of clay.  The Patillas soils are coarser textured."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification was updated with the 4/91 draft from Clayey, mixed, isohyperthermic Vertic Tropudults to Clayey, mixed, isohyperthermic Aquic Paleudults.  Although this soil contains vertic features such as slickensides, there is no evidence of cracking to the surface or the base of the Ap horizon in the description.  This needs to be tested.  The previous OSED date was 11/75.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - zone from 0 to 6 inches\nArgillic horizon - zone from 6 to 32 inches\nPale clay curve - Less than 20 percent clay cutback in Bt and C horizons.\nAquic feature - 2 chroma mottles in Bt3 horizon\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
