  "OVERVIEW": "The Moclips series consists of shallow to a placic horizon, poorly drained soils on glacial outwash terraces. These soils are formed in silty glaciolacustrine deposits over stratified glacial outwash. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
