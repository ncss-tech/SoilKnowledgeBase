  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 65 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 48 inches. Angular rock fragments of diabase and some quartzite and other rocks range from 0 to 50percent and from 5 to 60 percent in the C horizon. The rock fragment content in the particle control section averages less than 35 %. The upper part of the solum ranges from strongly to slightly acid and the lower part from moderately acid to neutral. The dominant clay mineral is kaolinite with appreciable amounts of illite and montmorillonite.\nThe A (and where present Ap) horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. Textures are silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, and sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction and averages 18 to 32 percent clay. It has prismatic or subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Textures are silt loam, loam, clay loam, sandy loam and loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction. Depth to loamy sand is greater than 40 inches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Lehigh and Passport series are in the same family Lehigh soils have rock fragments dominated by porcelanite in the lower part of the solum. The Passport series is somewhat poorly drained and sometimes can be very deep and has depths to the base of the argillic ranging from 40 to 80 inches. Passport series also has a strongly developed paleosol buried in the underlying till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mount Lucas soils are nearly level upland flats to steep concave lower slopes. They developed in materials weathered from diabase and other dark colored basic rocks. The climate is humid temperate with mean annual precipitation of 38 to 46 inches, mean annual temperature of 50 to 55 degrees F., and a frost-free season of 170 to 200 days."

Aldino, Calvert and Towhee soils have fragipans. Brecknock, Chrome, Legore, Montalto and Neshaminy soils are well drained. Watchung soils contain more clay and are gleyed immediately below the Ap horizon."
