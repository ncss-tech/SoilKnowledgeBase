  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section typically is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  Some pedons are stratified and some have fine sandy loam to  silty clay loam layers below depths of 40 inches.  Some have horizons that contain 1 to 20 percent by volume of gravel.  A few pedons contain gypsum crystals and other salts.\nThe A and AC horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry.  Horizons having color darker than value of 3.5 moist and 5.5 dry are less than 6 inches thick.   Textures range from fine sandy loam to sand.  These horizons are neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have thin Ab horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y and rarely 5GY, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Distinct or prominent mottles are in some horizons."

Deford soils are noncalcareous above 25 inches and have thicker dark colored surface horizons.  Gunbarrel soils are high in exchangeable sodium."
