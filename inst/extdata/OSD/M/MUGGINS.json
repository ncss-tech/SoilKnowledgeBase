  "OVERVIEW": "The Muggins series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in thick reddish brown noncalcareous glacial till, colluvium, alluvial material, or valley filling deposits or residuum derived from interbedded sandstone or shale with basalt overburden.  Muggins soils are on till plains, moraines, ridgeslopes, plateaus, or mountain sideslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 710 mm.  Mean annual air temperature is 1 degrees C.",
