  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is about 49 to 52 degrees F.   Thin dark colored A horizons occur in some pedons.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum and any C horizon and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nMoisture regime: udic\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is neutral through strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Textures are clay loam, clay, or sandy clay but clay ranges from 35 to 55 percent, silt from 5 to 45 percent, and sand from 15 to 60 percent with more than 15 percent fine or coarse sand.  Reaction is neutral through moderately acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10R.  It is typically loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 50 percent, and sand from 20 to 75 percent.  The horizon ranges from neutral to strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Muggins soils are on till plains, moraines, ridgetops, plateaus, or mountain side slopes.  Slopes range from about 2 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in thick reddish brown noncalcareous glacial till, colluvium, alluvial fans, residuum, or valley fillings deposits derived principally from sedimentary rock and interbedded sandstone and shale with basalt overburden.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 to 37 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 30 to 40 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 7,500 to 10,300 feet with the frost-free period varying widely from 20 to 75 days."

Chieftain soils have a mollic epipedon, are calcareous at or near the surface, and have hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  Swifton and Weminuche soils have less than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon."
