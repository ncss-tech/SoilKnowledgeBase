  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The alluvial fans and floodplains on which the soils occur consist of sediments washed from sandstone, limestone and sands or gravels derived from quartzite and similar rocks. Level or very gently sloping fans and flood plains.  Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent but range up to about 3 percent. Mogollon soils occur at elevations between 5,500 and 6,200 feet under a continental climate with average annual precipitation of 12 to 18 inches, mean annual temperature of 51 degrees F., average January temperature of 31 degrees F., average July temperature of 71 degrees F. and average frost-free period of about 125 days."
