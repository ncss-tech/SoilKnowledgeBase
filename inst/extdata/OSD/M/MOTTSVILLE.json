  "OVERVIEW": "The Mottsville series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Mottsville soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants and fan aprons.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
