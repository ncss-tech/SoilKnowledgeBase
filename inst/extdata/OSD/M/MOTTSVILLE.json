The Mottsville soils mapped in the Riverside and San Diego Areas of California in MLRAs 19 and 20 need correlation to another series.)\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 46 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nParticle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (AC and C1 horizons and part of the C2 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: The typical pedon at the series type location was sampled in 1961 and characterized by the soil survey laboratory in Riverside, CA as sample number S61Nev-3-5.  The data is published in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 23.\nUser Pedon ID: 2006NV005056.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
