  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 38 to 97 centimeters. Depth to bedrock is more than 152 centimeters. Textures in the fine-earth fraction of the mineral solum range from silt loam to coarse sandy loam, loam inclusive, in the upper 25 centimeters, loam or fine sandy loam to coarse sand between 25 and 43 centimeters, and from loamy sand to coarse sand below 43 centimeters. The substratum is loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have strata of sand, gravel, and cobbles in the substratum. Rock fragment content averages 35 to 60 percent in the particle- size control section but individual horizons range from 5 to 60 percent in the upper part of the mineral solum and from 35 to 75 percent in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. Rock fragments are mostly gravel with some cobbles and a few stones. In some pedons there is discontinuous cementation in the B and C horizons. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum and very strongly acid to moderately acid in the substratum.\nThe Oa horizon, and the Oe horizon where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 2.5 and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have an Oi horizon.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bh horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 3. Some pedons have a Bhs horizon with hue of 2.5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 4 to 8. Consistence is very friable or friable in the upper part and may grade to loose in the lower part.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8. Consistence is loose to friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Colton, Hermon, Stetson, and Swancott series are in the same family. Colton soils have rock fragments dominated by granite with lesser amounts of sandstone, and have a loamy cap less than 10 inches thick. Hermon soils do not have stratification in the substratum and have formed in till. Stetson soils have a loamy cap greater than 17 inches thick.Swancott soils formed in glacio-fluvial deposits from sedimentary parent material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Masardis soils are on glaciomarine deltas, pitted outwash, eskers, kames and kame terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent. The soils formed in gravelly glaciofluvial deposits derived mainly from slate, phyllite, and other dark colored metamorphic and metasedimentary rocks, and to a lesser extent from granite, gneiss, schist and other light colored igneous rocks. The climate is humid and cool temperate. The mean annual temperature ranges from 1 to 8 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 86 to 122 centimeters. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 2 to 650 meters above mean sea level."

The Adams, Allagash, Colton, and Stetson soils are in similar positions on the landscape. Adams and Allagash soils have less than 20 percent rock fragments, Colton soils have a loamy cap less than 25 centimeters thick, and Stetson soils have a loamy cap greater than 43 centimeters thick. Bucksport and Wonsqueak soils are organic soils in adjacent bogs. Fryeburg and Ondawa soils are on nearby flood plains. Sheepscot and Machias soils are moderately well drained and are in lower positions on the landscape."
