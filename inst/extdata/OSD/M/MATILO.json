  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Matilo soils are on gently sloping uplands with plain or concave surfaces.  Areas are along footslopes and narrow valleys below sandstone hills and ridges.  Slope gradients are commonly 1 to 3 percent but range from 1 to 5 percent.  The soil formed mainly in sandstone of the Hickory Formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free period is 215 to 230 days and elevation ranges from 1,100 to 1,700 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E Index ranges from 38 to about 44."
