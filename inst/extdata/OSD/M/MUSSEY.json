  "OVERVIEW": "The Mussey series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained that are shallow to sand and gravel. The Mussey soils formed in loamy outwash and are on outwash plains and valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
