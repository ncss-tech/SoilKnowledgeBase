    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mussey soils are on outwash plains and valley trains. They formed in loamy outwash underlain by sand and gravel at depths of less than 20 inches. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 864 mm (28 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Mussey soils are in a drainage sequence with the somewhat excessively drained Casco soils and the somewhat poorly drained Fabius soils. Gilford, Sebewa and the somewhat poorly drained Wasepi soils are associated on some outwash plains. All of these have thicker sola. In addition, Gilford and Wasepi soils are coarse-loamy."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and high or very high in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and rapid in the substratum."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
