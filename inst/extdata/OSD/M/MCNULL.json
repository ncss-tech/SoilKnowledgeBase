    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Solum thickness is typically 25 to 38 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 35 percent rock fragments of which 5 to 20 percent are gravel and 5 to 15 percent are cobbles.  The control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 35 percent rock fragments of which 0 to 30 percent are gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist and dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 35 percent rock fragments of which 5 to 20 percent are gravel and 5 to 15 percent are cobbles.  It is strongly or moderately acid."

Elevation is 1,500 to 4,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent."
