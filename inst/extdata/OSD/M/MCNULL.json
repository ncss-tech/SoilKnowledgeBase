  "OVERVIEW": "The McNull series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from volcanic tuffs and breccias.  McNull soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 12 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Solum thickness is typically 25 to 38 inches.

The control section averages 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
