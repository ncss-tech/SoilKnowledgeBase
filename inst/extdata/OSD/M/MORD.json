  "OVERVIEW": "The Mord series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in materials derived mainly from sedimentary rocks.  Mord soils are on hills, mountainsides, and valley side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 to 42 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.   These soils have mollic epipedons 10 to 15 inches thick.  They are noncalcareous throughout the solum and in at least the upper 3 inches of the C horizon.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 50 to 80 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and C horizon and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from moderately acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically clay loam, clay, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly clay, and averages 35 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt, and 15 to 55 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  This horizon is typically clay loam or sandy clay loam.  It ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline."

Cebone soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Donald, Gaylord, and Hayrack soils have solums less than 50 inches to the base of the argillic horizon, are calcareous in the lower part of the solum and in the C horizons, and have continuous subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Powderhorn soils have hue of 5YR or redder, have solums less than 50 inches to the base of the argillic horizon, and have a large proportion of coarse and very coarse angular sand in the sand fraction."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soil formed in parent materials derived mainly from sedimentary and intermediate igneous rocks.  At the type location, the average annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 degrees F, and mean summer temperature is 51 degrees F.  In Utah, these soils receive 22 to 30 inches of yearly precipitation at elevations of 7,400 to 10,200 feet, with a freeze-free period of 40 to 70 days, and have air temperatures down to 34 degrees F."
