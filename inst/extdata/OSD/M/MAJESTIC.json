  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to dense till is 45 to 60 inches. The depth to carbonates is greater than 60 inches. Redoximorphic concentrations occur above 40 inches. Rock fragment content, by volume, ranges from 0 to 14 percent in the mantle and from 1 to 8 percent in the underlying till. A thin lag line with as much as 30 percent rock fragments is at the contact of the two sediments in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. Some pedons have an Ap horizon ranging from 6 to 9 inches in thickness. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture of the upper Bw is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. Texture of the lower Bw is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or fine sand. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2B/E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is clay loam or clay. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is clay or clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon (when present) has colors and textures similar to the 2Bt horizon. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2BCd horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is clay or clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Majestic soils are on linear or convex surfaces of till plains and moraines. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. They formed in a 20 to 40 inch mantle of sandy glacial outwash or eolian sediments and underlying fine, dense glacial till deposited by the St. Louis sublobe of late Wisconsin age. Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches. The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days. Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1600 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Mooseline and poorly drained Turpela soils form a hydrosequence with Majestic soils. The somewhat poorly drained Buhl, moderately well drained Hibbing, poorly drained McQuade and very poorly drained Fayal soils form a hydrosequence and do not have a coarse-textured mantle. The very poorly drained Daisybay and Dora soils occur on broad flats and in depressions and formed in organic materials over till. The very poorly drained Rifle soils are in depressions and formed in organic material."
