The control section has more than 5 percent silt plus clay.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand. Some pedons lack Ap2 horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6, and some pedons are reddish brown (5YR 4/4). It typically is loamy fine sand, fine sand, and loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is fine sand or sand. Some pedons have brown and grayish brown mottles below depths of 48 inches and some contain thin strata of loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Buncombe soils have less fine sand and have flakes of mica throughout. Crevasse soils contain less silt and clay in the solum, have less fine sand throughout, and lack hues redder than 10YR in the upper part of the 10 to 40 inch control secton. Peveto soils have shell fragments throughout. Tarboro soils have less fine and very fine sand and typically contain fewer weatherable minerals."
