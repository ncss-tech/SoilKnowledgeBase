  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils have been correlated in the past as mesic taxadjuncts of Pocomoke series. In addition to being outside the temperature range of the Pocomoke series, Mullica soils do not have argillic horizons; although in some places there are a few thin clay films on peds or bridging between sand grains in the Bg horizons. Many areas have finer textured strata within the solum.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon--the zone from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ag horizon)\nAlbic horizon--the zone from 33 to 53 cm (Eg horizon)\nCambic horizon--the zone from a depth of 53 to 79 cm (Bg horizon)\nAquic conditions--the zone from 0 to 200 cm is periodically saturated (endosaturation)\nPrevious revision: 11/2002-JAK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
