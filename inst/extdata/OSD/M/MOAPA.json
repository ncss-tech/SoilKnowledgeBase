  "OVERVIEW": "The Moapa series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands over sandstone. Moapa soils are on sand sheet over rock pediments. Slope ranges from 4 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 66 degrees F.",
