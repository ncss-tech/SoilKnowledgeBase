  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sand, or sand and gravel ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Salinity is slight in the surface layer; gypsum content ranges from 5 to about 10 percent in the Ccs horizon and decreases with increasing depth; calcium carbonate also decreases with increasing depth.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the control section and are predominantly of gravel size.  The control section is usually loam but has 18 to 35 percent clay.  Depth to water table fluctuates from depth of about 2 feet to deeper than 5 feet, and the soil is mottled due to wetness below a depth of about 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y.  The wide range in color is related to the fluctuating water table."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mogote soils are on low alluvial flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent, but generally less than 1 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium with some influence from basaltic outwash.  Average annual precipitation at the type location ranges from 6 to 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is 56 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 95 days."
