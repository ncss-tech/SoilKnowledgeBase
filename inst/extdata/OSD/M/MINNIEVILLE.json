  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet.  Rock fragments of angular vein quartz range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the profile.  Partially weathered hornblende gneiss or hornblende schist fragments are 0 to 10 percent in the A, Ap, E, and upper Bt horizons, and 0 to 25 percent in the lower Bt and C horizons.  Mica flakes are few to common in the B and C horizons.  Reaction is strongly acid through moderately acid unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is clay, clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon is commonly multicolored in shades of red, yellow, and white. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam or silt loam, in the fine earth fraction."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

The Culpeper soils formed in materials that weathered from arkosic sandstones, phyllites, quartzites and schists and contain rock fragments of these.  The Elioak soils formed in weathered products of quartz Muscovite schist and do not have hornblende schist fragments."

These soils developed in residuum from hornblende gneiss or hornblende schist and other mixed basic and acidic volcanogenic materials. Annual temperature ranges from about 53 to 57 degrees F.  Annual precipitation ranges from about 39 to 43 inches."

The Orenda soils have less than 10YR colors in their B horizons.  The Spriggs have thinner subsoil and lower content of clay.  The Buckhall soils have rock fragments of granite or granite gneiss and the Elioak soils have rock fragments of quartz muscovite schist."
