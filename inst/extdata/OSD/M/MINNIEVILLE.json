  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet.  Rock fragments of angular vein quartz range from 0 to 10 percent throughout the profile.  Partially weathered\nhornblende gneiss or hornblende schist fragments are 0 to 10 percent in the A, Ap, E, and upper Bt horizons, and 0 to 25 percent in the lower Bt and C horizons.  Mica flakes are few to common in the B and C horizons.  Reaction is strongly acid through moderately acid unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is clay, clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon is commonly multicolored in shades of red, yellow, and white. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam or silt loam, in the fine earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Colleen (T), Culpeper and Elioak series. The Colleen soils have rock fragments of  anorthosite and formed in material weathered from anorthosite.  The Culpeper soils formed in materials that\nweathered from arkosic sandstones, phyllites, quartzites and schists and contain rock fragments of these.  The Elioak soils formed in weathered products of quartz Muscovite schist and do not have hornblende schist fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Minnieville soils are on ridges and sideslopes of the northern part of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 25 percent.  These soils developed in residuum from hornblende gneiss or\nhornblende schist and other mixed basic and acidic volcanogenic materials. Annual temperature ranges from about 53 to 57 degrees F.  Annual precipitation ranges from about 39 to 43 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are dominantly the Orenda and Spriggs and to lesser extent Buckhall and Elioak soils.  The Orenda soils have less than 10YR colors in their B horizons.  The Spriggs have thinner subsoil and lower content of clay.  The Buckhall soils have rock fragments\nof granite or granite gneiss and the Elioak soils have rock fragments of quartz muscovite schist."
