  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  This is a cyclic soil with solum 40 to more than 60 inches thick.  The weighted average clay content of the particle size control section ranges from 40 to 60 percent.    Cracks 1 to 3 inches wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 20 inches when the soil is dry.  In undisturbed areas there is gilgai microrelief with microknolls 4 to 12 inches higher than microdepressions.  Cycles of knolls and depressions are repeated each 6 to 23 feet.  Intersecting slickensides begin at depths of 15 to 24 inches.  The soil is moderately alkaline and calcareous clay or silty clay throughout with clay content of 40 to 60 percent.  Limestone fragments about 10 to 24 inches across the long axis cover 0 to 10 percent of the soil surface.\nThickness of the A horizon is variable within the pedon and ranges  from about 3 to 8 inches thick on knolls and 8 to 20 inches thick in depressions.  Colors are in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 through 4.  Where moist color values are less than 4, the horizon is less than 12 inches thick or comprises less than 50 percent of the pedon.\nThe Bssk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y; value of 5 through 7; and chroma of 2 through 4.  Some pedons contain grayish, brownish, or yellowish mottles.  Concretions and soft masses of calcium carbonate range from 2 to 20 percent by volume.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 30 to 45 percent in the lower part.  Selenite gypsum crystals, larger than 2 mm, range from 0 to about 10 percent by volume and increase with depth.\nColors of the C horizon are in shades of gray, brown, or yellow with or without mottles.  It is marly or shaley clay or silty clay with calcium carbonate equivalent of 45 to more than 60 percent."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Deport, Frelsburg, Ferris, Latium, and Depalt in the same family and the similar Sanger, Slidell, Ellis and McLennan.  Deport soils have developed over clayey sediments and are over 80 inches thick.  Frelsburg, Ferris, and Latium contain less than 30 percent calcium carbonate.  In addition Ferris soils are underlain by shale, Frelsburg and latium have developed over Tertiary age material and are moist for slightly longer periods.  Depalt soils have hues 7.5YR and redder.  Sanger and Slidell contain less calcium carbonate and have moist color value less than 3.5 in the upper 12 inches.  Ellis soils are noncalcareous in the surface layer.  McLennan soils are in a fine-silty family and contain over 40 percent calcium carbonate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Medlin soils are on narrow stream divides or slopes along drainageways.  These gently sloping to moderately steep soils have slopes from 1 to 20 percent, but slopes are mainly 5 to 12 percent.  The soil formed in alkaline, clayey marine sediments of Lower Cretaceous systems like those of the Grayson Marl and, Del Rio Formation.  The climate is warm subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 28 to 34 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 64 degrees to 67 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E indices are 48 to 56."

Mingo soils have mollic epipedons.  Slidell soils have chroma less than 1.5 throughout the upper 12 inches.  Bolar soils are on positions similar to Medlin soils.  Mingo soils are above on convex ridgetops.  Sanger, Slidell, and Somervell soils are usually above on broad stream divides."

This series probably occurs only in the Grand Prairie Land Resource Area.  The calcium carbonate equivalent increases with depth.  This series has a lower liquid limit and plasticity index than the Ferris series."
