  "OVERVIEW": "The McGary series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake plains, and less commonly on flood-plain steps. They formed in loess and the underlying calcareous, fine-textured lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1168 mm (35 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 210 days."

The poorly drained or very poorly drained Booker, Kings, Montgomery, and Zipp soils are on flats and depressions on lake plains."
