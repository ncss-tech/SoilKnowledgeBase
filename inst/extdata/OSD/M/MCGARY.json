  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McGary soils are typically on flats on lake plains, and less commonly on flood-plain steps. Slope gradients are dominantly 0 to 2 percent, but range to 10 percent. These soils formed in 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 inches) of loess and in the underlying calcareous, fine-textured lacustrine deposits of Wisconsin age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1168 mm (35 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 210 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: McGary soils are commonly associated with the Markland, Montgomery, Shircliff, and Zipp soils. They are also associated with the Booker and Kings soils. The well drained Markland are on risers and moderately well drained Shircliff soils are on treads of dissected lake plains. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Booker, Kings, Montgomery, and Zipp soils are on flats and depressions on lake plains."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. In undrained areas, depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low or moderately low. Permeability is slow or very slow. On flood-plain steps, this soil is subject to frequent to rare periods of flooding."
