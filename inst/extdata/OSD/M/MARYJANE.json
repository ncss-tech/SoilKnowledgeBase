  "OVERVIEW": "The Maryjane series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Maryjane soils are on inset fans and lower back slopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
