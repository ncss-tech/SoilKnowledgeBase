  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum typically is more than 60 inches thick but ranges from about 48 to 90 inches in thickness.  Carbonates are absent in the solum.  The solum is medium acid or strongly acid in the most acid part.\nThe Ap or A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) or brown (10YR 4/3).  Some pedons have very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) or dark brown (10YR 3/3) coatings on faces of peds.  The A horizon is silt loam with about 20 to 24 percent clay.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam with about 18 to 24 percent clay.\nA BE horizon is in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3, 4, or 6.  It is silty clay loam with a clay content of 27 to 35 percent.  The depth to the layer of maximum clay content is between 30 and 36 inches in most pedons.  Few or common mottles of low and high chroma are in the lower part of the Bt horizon and BC horizon in most pedons."

Alford, Birkbeck, Fayette, Inton, Iona, Menfro, Rozetta, Seaton, St.  Charles, and Winfield soils all formed in loess, have thinner E horizons, and are not so deep to the clay maximum.  Baraboo, Blackhammer, Dubuque, Knowles, La Farge, and Marseilles soils have bedrock within depths of 40 inches.  Bertrand, Jackson, and Middletown soils have more sand and less clay in the lower parts of the sola.  Blackhammer, Cadiz, Camden, Dodge, Elco, Lomira, Mayville, Minnith, Rush, Russell, and Zurich soils have 2Bt horizons and more sand in the lower part of the solum.  Eleroy, Palsgrove, and Weingarten soils have finer textures in the lower part of the solum.  Flagg and Hackers soils have redder hue in the lower part of the solum.  Mentor soils have stratification in the lower parts of the solum.  Sylvan and Uniontown soils have thinner solum.  Westmore soils have shale and sandstone fragments at depths of less than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Martinsburg soils are on plane or slightly concave foot slopes of 2 to 9 percent gradient.  They formed in oxidized and leached silty colluvium from adjacent loess uplands.  Total sand content typically is less than 15 percent, and most is fine and very fine in size.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 48 to 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 32 to 36 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Fayette soils and the Clinton, Coppock, Lindley, and Vesser soils.  Fayette and Clinton soils are on ridges and side slopes upslope.  Clinton soils have a thinner E horizon and higher clay content in the Bt horizon.  Coppock and Vesser soils are on similar landscape positions but have a grayer B horizon.  Vesser soils also have mollic epipedons.  Lindley soils are on side slopes upslope and have more sand and coarse fragments in the Bt horizon."
