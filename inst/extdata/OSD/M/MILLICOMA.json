The soil is usually moist but is dry for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  In forested areas, the Oi horizon is 1 to 4 inches thick.  The particle-size control is 10 to 25 percent clay.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.   Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Some pedons have a C horizon.  The Cr horizon increases in hardness with increasing depth.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It has 8 to 15 percent organic matter.  It is medial loam or gravelly medial loam with 10 to 25 percent clay.  It has 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is extremely acid or very strongly acid.  It has a bulk density of 0.55 to 1.0 g/cubic centimeter and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam or extremely gravelly loam.  It has 35 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid."

The soils formed dominantly in sandstone with some areas of metasedimentary or metavolcanic origin.  Elevations are 50 to 1,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and cool and moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F., mean January temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 58 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 270 days."
