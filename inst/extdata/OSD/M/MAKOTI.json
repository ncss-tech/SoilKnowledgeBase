The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 24 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2, moist.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Narrow tongues of A horizon extend into the Bw horizon in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon typically has 2.5Y or 10YR hue, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It contains disseminated carbonates and contains 15 to 30 percent calcium carbonate.  Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It contains few to many mottles and commonly is stratified very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam."

Grassna soils formed in loess or other silty sediments and contain 18 to 30 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  In addition, they commonly have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Wilton soils has a 2C horizon of loam or clay loam glacial till at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Arnegard and Roseglen soils are fine-loamy.  Grail soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the 10-to 40-inch control section."
