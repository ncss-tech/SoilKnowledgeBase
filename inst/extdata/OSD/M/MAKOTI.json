  "OVERVIEW": "The Makoti series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in glaciolacustrine sediments.  These soils are on glacial lake plains and have slope ranging from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",
