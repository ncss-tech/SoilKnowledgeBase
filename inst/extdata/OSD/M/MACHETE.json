  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 27 to 62 inches.  Soil reaction varies from very strongly to strongly acid.  Mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches is 72 degrees F. or more and the difference between mean summer and mean winter temperatures is less than 9 degrees F.  Mineralogy is mixed.  Base saturation (by sum of cations) is 35 percent or more at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizons.  These soils are dry for 90 cumulative days or more during most years.\nColors of the surface horizons are in hues of 5YR and 7.5YR, values of 4 and chromas of 2 to 4.  Texture of the surface layers ranges from sandy loam to clay loam.\nColors of the B horizons are in hues of 7.5YR and 5YR, values of 4 to 6 and chromas of 4 to 8.  Structure of the B2t horizons range from weak to moderate subangular blocky.  Dark concretions range from few to common and from fine to medium in size in the B horizons.  The B3 horizons range from clay loam to sandy clay loam in texture.\nC horizons are stratified gravelly sandy clay loams to loamy sands."

The Amelia soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in their argillic horizons.  The Bexar, Katemcy and Lindy soils have thermic soil temperatures.  The Guayama soils have hard rock within 20 inches of the surface.  The Lavallee soils have coarser textured argillic horizons with less than 35 percent clay.  The Dorothea soils have yellower B horizons in hues of 10YR and are less acid-neutral to medium acid."

The regolith is moderately coarse to fine textured sediments derived from volcanic rocks.  The climate is semiarid.  Rainfall ranges form 30 to 45 inches and the average mean annual temperature is 80 degrees F."

The Vives soils have darker colored A horizons and are neutral to mildly alkaline in reaction.  The San Anton soils formed in recent sediments on flood plains have finer texture in the A horizon and are neutral to mildly alkaline in reaction."
