  "OVERVIEW": "The Millstadt series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed on loess-covered lacustrine terraces treads.  The Millstadt soils formed in loess and the underlying lacustrine deposits.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

The poorly drained Floraville and Lakaskia soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional treads of the lacustrine terrace.  Also, the Lakaskia soils have a mollic epipedon.  The moderately well drained Redbud soils are on more convex or more sloping parts of the lacustrine terrace.  The Redbud and Floraville soils form a hydrosequence with the Millstadt soils.  The poorly drained or very poorly drained Wabash soils have a mollic epipedon and are in drainageways on the lacustrine terraces."
