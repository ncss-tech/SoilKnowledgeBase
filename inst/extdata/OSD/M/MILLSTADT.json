  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Millstadt soils are on loess-covered lacustrine terraces treads.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in 91 to 178 cm (36 to 70 inches) of loess (Peoria Silt), and the underlying lacustrine deposits (Equality Formation).  In some pedons, the loess and lacustrine deposits are interbedded.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1016 mm (36 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 104 to 131 meters (340 to 430 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bartelso, Floraville, Lakaskia, Redbud, and Wabash soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Bartelso soils have a mollic horizon and are on similar landform positions nearby.  They form a biosequence with the Millstadt soils.  The poorly drained Floraville and Lakaskia soils are on nearly level or slightly depressional treads of the lacustrine terrace.  Also, the Lakaskia soils have a mollic epipedon.  The moderately well drained Redbud soils are on more convex or more sloping parts of the lacustrine terrace.  The Redbud and Floraville soils form a hydrosequence with the Millstadt soils.  The poorly drained or very poorly drained Wabash soils have a mollic epipedon and are in drainageways on the lacustrine terraces."

The depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 foot to 2.0 feet) in drained areas between December and April in normal years.  The potential for surface runoff is low or medium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low.  Permeability is slow."
