It is loam or silt loam and has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw and Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Few grey redox depletions are on surfaces of peds below depth of 20 inches.  It is loam or silt loam and has 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.
