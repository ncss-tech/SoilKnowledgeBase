The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to the very hard, very firm 2C horizon is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry , and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or silt loam and has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw and Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Few grey redox depletions are on surfaces of peds below depth of 20 inches.  It is loam or silt loam and has 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It has 0 to about 5 percent gravel above depth of 40 inches and increase below this depth.\nThe 2C horizon has 2 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles."
