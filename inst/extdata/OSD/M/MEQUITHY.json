  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to a lithic contact with igneous or metamorphic bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  The  loamy or silty eolian or alluvial mantle ranges from 12 to 35 inches thick.  The content of clay ranges from 5 to 15 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of rock fragments in the particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments are mostly of igneous and metamorphic origin and mixed lithology.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper mantle and 5 to 30 percent in the till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper mantle and from 0 to 30 percent in the till.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from very strongly acid to slightly acid below the spodic horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It has texture like the Bhs horizon.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a 2E' horizon with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  Value and chroma of 4 do not occur together.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nMequithy soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation below the spodic horizon has a wide range depending on the thickness of the eolian mantle and the depth to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons, singly or in combination, with or without Bt or 2Bt horizons.\nThe E' part of the E/B or B/E horizons has color and texture like the E' horizon above.\nThe Bt part of the E/B and B/E horizons has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2E' part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has color and texture like the 2E' horizon described above.\nThe 2Bt part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon, has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogs. Some pedons have pockets or thin subhorizons of loamy sand or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nThe 2Bt horizon has color and texture like the 2Bt part described above.\nThe 3R horizon is hard, fractured igneous or metamorphic bedrock."
