These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  The 10- to 40-inch control section contains 5 to 10 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 17 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has dry value of 4 or 5, and moist value of 2 or 3.  It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  In uncultivated areas the A1 horizon has dry value of 4 or 5, moist value of 3, and dry and moist chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe AC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Texture is stratified fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."
