These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  The 10- to 40-inch control section contains 5 to 10 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 17 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has dry value of 4 or 5, and moist value of 2 or 3.  It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  In uncultivated areas the A1 horizon has dry value of 4 or 5, moist value of 3, and dry and moist chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe AC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  Texture is stratified fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

The climate is continental and marine; mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F; average annual precipitation is 14 to 19 inches and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
