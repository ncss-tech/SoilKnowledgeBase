  "STATES": "KY,WV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Myra series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in calcareous materials derived from the surface mining of coal. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow. The regolith is a mixture of partially weathered fine-earth and rock fragments. Slopes range from 0 to 80 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to rock is more than 5 feet. Coarse fragments, consisting mostly of calcareous and non-calcareous channers and flagstones of shale, siltstone, some sandstone and minor amounts of coal, are dominantly 2 mm to 10 inches in diameter but stones and boulders may be included. Content of fragments in the control section ranges from 35 to 70 percent and averages about 40 percent. Clay content in the control section ranges from 12 to 30 percent, but is commonly less than 27 percent. Most pedons have mixed colors in shades of red, brown, yellow or gray. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the A horizon and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8 and chroma of 1 to 8 or is neutral. Texture of the fine-earth is fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam. The A horizon of some pedons was formed by the spreading of stockpiled natural soil material. In these pedons, the A horizon is 4 to 20 inches thick and contains 5 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 8 and chroma of 1 to 8 or neutral. Texture of the fine-earth is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam, and less commonly silty clay loam or clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Morristown series is a close competitor, but has an active CEC activity class. The Barkcamp, Bethesda, Cedarcreek, Enoch, Fairpoint, Fiveblock, Itmann, Kaymine and Sewell series are also in related families. Morristown soils formed from mine spoil dominated by limestone and shale and commonly have more clay in the control section. Fairpoint, Fiveblock and Kaymine soils are in non-acid families. Barkcamp, Bethesda, Cedarcreek, Enoch, Itmann, and Sewell soils are in acid families. In addition, Itmann soils contain more than 50 percent carbolithic fragments. Enoch and Barkcamp soils are ultra acid and have siliceous mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Myra soils are on nearly level to gently sloping ridgetops and benches; gently sloping to strongly sloping hill slopes; and steep to very steep mountain side slopes. These soils formed in regolith derived from surface coal mine operations. The regolith is a mixture of partially weathered fine-earth and rock fragments. The fine-earth material is from original soils; bedrock which has been crushed by machinery; or the weathering of fragments that have been in place long enough to disintegrate. Rock fragments are mostly Pennsylvanian aged calcareous and non-calcareous shale and siltstone mixed with small amounts of fine to coarse grained sandstone and coal. Mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches."

Berks, Dekalb, Marrowbone and Muskingum soils are moderately deep to bedrock, have cambic horizons and formed in residuum on undisturbed uplands. Gilpin and Latham soils have argillic horizons and also formed in residuum on undisturbed uplands. Jefferson, Pineville and Shelocta soils have argillic horizons and formed in colluvium on mountain side slopes. Fedscreek, Kimper and Sharondale soils have cambic horizons and formed in colluvium on mountain side slopes. Sharondale soils have mollic epipedons."
