  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  Ironstone pebbles average from few to 35 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Where chroma are less than 3.5 moist, the horizon is less than 10 inches thick.  The A horizon is fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe lower Bt horizons have hue of 10R, 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of brown and yellow range from none to common in the lower part.  These features are considered to be inherited from the parent material.  Moist color values are 4 or greater in some part of the argillic horizon.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, clay, or their gravelly or very gravelly counterparts with an average clay content of 35 to 50 percent.  Some thin horizons have as much as 45 to 50 percent ironstone pebbles from 5 to 15 mm in size, but weighted average of the control section is less than 35 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  Base saturation ranges from 75 to 85 percent throughout the Bt horizon.\nThe B/C or BC horizon has a hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, Sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon is variable and is mottled in shades of yellow, gray, brown, olive, or black, and ranges partially weathered glauconitic sandstone and greensand to clay loam or sandy loam material weathered from materials of the Weches formation.  Marine shell fossils range from none to common.  The reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline."
