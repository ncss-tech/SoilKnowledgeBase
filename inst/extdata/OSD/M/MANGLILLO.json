    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Manglillo soils are in tidal marshes along the coast of the Semiarid Coastal Plains MLRA. These areas are either under sea water or are flooded by high tides. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. They formed in decomposed organic material overlying regolith consisting in sand size shell fragments, quartz grains and subrounded volcanic fragments of recent beach deposits. The climate is tropical semiarid. The average annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 36 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 82 to 86 degrees F."
