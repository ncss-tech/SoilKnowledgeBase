  "OVERVIEW": "The Military series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to a lithic contact with sandstone.  These upland soils formed in sandy loam till underlain by sandstone bedrock.  Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
