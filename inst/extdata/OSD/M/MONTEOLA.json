  "OVERVIEW": "The Monteola series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils. These soils formed in clays and clays interbedded with sandstone and claystone of the Oakville and Fleming Formation. These gently to moderately sloping soils occur on hillslopes on inland dissected coastal plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
