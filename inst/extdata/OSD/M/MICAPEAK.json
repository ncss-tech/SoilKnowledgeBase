  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Micapeak soils are on side slopes, ridges and structural benches of mountains and foothills at elevations of 600 to 1,280 meters. They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, and schist with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Slopes are 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 500 to 900 mm. The mean annual temperature is 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C. The frost-free period is 80 to 130 days."

Kramerhill soils are mesic, deep to a paralithic contact, have fine-loamy argillic horizons and are on convex backslopes of foothills. Kruse soils have fine-loamy argillic horizons, are very deep, and are on linear backslopes of foothills. Quinnamose soils are frigid, are deep to a paralithic contact, and are on mountain and foothill slopes.  Spokane soils are mesic, are moderately deep to a paralithic contact, and are on convex backslopes of foothills."
