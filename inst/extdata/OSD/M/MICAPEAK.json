  "OVERVIEW": "The Micapeak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on mountain and foothill slopes. They formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granite, gneiss, and schist with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Slope ranges from 5 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 625 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
