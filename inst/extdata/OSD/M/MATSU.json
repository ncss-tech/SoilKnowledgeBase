  "OVERVIEW": "The Matsu series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Matsu soils are in depressions on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
