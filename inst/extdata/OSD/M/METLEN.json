  "OVERVIEW": "The Metlen series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium, slope alluvium and/or residuum derived from mixed metamorphic or sedimentary rock.  These soils occur on hills or mountain slopes.  Slopes are 8 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
