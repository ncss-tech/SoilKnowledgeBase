Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the A and AB horizons and from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the Bt, BC, and C horizons.  The combined total of rock fragments in the control section is less than 5 percent, by volume.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe AB horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Content of saprolite ranges from 5 to 20 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Content of saprolite ranges from 20 to 60 percent, by volume.  Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe C horizon is composed of saprolite, has no dominant color, and is multicolored in shades of red, brown and yellow.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay."

The poorly drained Ciales soils are on lower concave positions, have fine-loamy control sections, and have a Histic epipedon.  Cuchillas soils are on similar positions, do not have an argillic horizon, have less clay in the control section, and are moderately deep to volcanic rock.  Los Guineos and the moderately well drained Yunque soils are on similar positions, have yellow kaolinitic control sections, and are Oxisols.  The somewhat poorly drained Picacho soils are on similar positions in concave areas, have fine-loamy control sections, and cambic horizons."
