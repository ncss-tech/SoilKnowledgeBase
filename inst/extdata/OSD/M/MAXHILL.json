    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean average annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of mollic is 25 to 50 inches and includes part or all of the argillic horizon. The upper 10 to 25 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.25 to 0.6 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section has 35 to 40 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent in the Ap or A horizon. Depth to the Bt horizon is 11 to 20 inches. Depth to the 2BC horizon is 40 and 60 inches. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Ap and A horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Texture of the Ap horizon is ashy loam, cobbly ashy loam, or very cobbly ashy loam. Texture of the A horizon is ashy loam, gravelly ashy loam, or very gravelly ashy loam or cobbly ashy loam. It has 5 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe AB horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is gravelly ashy loam, very gravelly ashy loam, or cobbly ashy loam with 18 to 23 percent clay.  It has 5 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. Texture is extremely gravelly sandy clay, extremely cobbly sandy clay, very gravelly sandy clay or very cobbly sandy clay with 35 to 40 percent clay.  It has 20 to 55 percent gravel, 5 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, extremely cobbly loamy sand or extremely gravelly loamy sand with 0 to 15 percent clay.  It has 35 to 60 percent gravel, 15 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones."

These soils formed in alluvium or outwash deposits with an influence of loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. Elevation is 1,700 to 3,100 feet. Here soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."

Kayak soils are on flood plains, have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches to a 2BC horizon. Metser soils are on terraces and alluvial fans, have 40 to 55 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Millhouse soils on alluvial fans and terraces, have 20 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches to a 2C horizon. Reelow, Reeser, Lablue and Sketter soils are on old fan remnants, old terraces and old till plains and all have a duripan. Weirman soils are on flood plains and low terraces and are sandy-skeletal."
