  "OVERVIEW": "The Maxhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash deposits with an influence of loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. They are on alluvial fans and terraces. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of mollic is 25 to 50 inches and includes part or all of the argillic horizon. The upper 10 to 25 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.25 to 0.6 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. The particle-size control section has 35 to 40 percent clay and 35 to 80 percent rock fragments by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent in the Ap or A horizon. Depth to the Bt horizon is 11 to 20 inches. Depth to the 2BC horizon is 40 and 60 inches. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Ap and A horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. Texture of the Ap horizon is ashy loam, cobbly ashy loam, or very cobbly ashy loam. Texture of the A horizon is ashy loam, gravelly ashy loam, or very gravelly ashy loam or cobbly ashy loam. It has 5 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe AB horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is gravelly ashy loam, very gravelly ashy loam, or cobbly ashy loam with 18 to 23 percent clay.  It has 5 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. Texture is extremely gravelly sandy clay, extremely cobbly sandy clay, very gravelly sandy clay or very cobbly sandy clay with 35 to 40 percent clay.  It has 20 to 55 percent gravel, 5 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 3 percent stones.\nThe 2BC horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, extremely cobbly loamy sand or extremely gravelly loamy sand with 0 to 15 percent clay.
