  "OVERVIEW": "The Malabar series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained, slowly permeable soils in sloughs, shallow depressions and along flood plains in the Southern Florida Flatwoods (MLRA 155), the Southern Florida Lowlands (MLRA 156B), Florida Everglades and Associated Areas (MLRA 156A) and the South Central Florida Ridge (MLRA 154) Major Land Resource Areas. They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, and yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam. Some pedons have a thin Btg1 horizon of loamy sand or loamy fine sand. The BC horizon may have loamy fine sand texture. A few intrusions of coarser textured material from overlying horizons are in the Btg horizon in many pedons.  In some pedons, the Btg horizon contains small bodies of pyrite.  The presence of pyrite cannot be predicted. Lowering the water table can result in the pyrite reacting to form acids that may lower the pH in local spots within the horizon to 3.5 or less.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand with pockets or lenses of loamy material. Content of shell fragments ranges from none to about 50 percent by volume."

EauGallie, Farmton, Myakka, Oldsmar and Wabasso soils have spodic horizons. The poorly drained Ft. Drum soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have Bk horizons. Lokosee and Valkaria soils have weakly expressed spodic horizons. Hallandale soils are shallow to limestone bedrock. Pineda and the poorly drained Riviera soils are Arenic Glossaqualfs. The poorly drained Winder soils have an argillic horizon within a depth of 20 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Malabar soils were formerly mapped in the Charlotte series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 14 inches (A & E horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone between depths of 5 to 14 inches (E1 and E2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone between depths of 45 to 54 inches (Btg horizon).\nThe water table is within depths of 10 inches for 2 to 6 months during most years and can recede to a depth of more than 40 inches in extended dry periods. Depressions are ponded for periods ranging from 3 to 6 months in most years. Flood plains are inundated for periods ranging from 7 days to 1 month in most years.\nMalabar soils are primarily in MLRA 155, but are also in MLRAs 154, 156A and 156B."
