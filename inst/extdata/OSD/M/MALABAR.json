    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 90 inches. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4. Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, and yellow range from few to many. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, and yellow range from few to many. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E' horizon has hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7. Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, and yellow range from few to many. Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg and BCg horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 5 to 7. Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, and yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam. Some pedons have a thin Btg1 horizon of loamy sand or loamy fine sand. The BC horizon may have loamy fine sand texture. A few intrusions of coarser textured material from overlying horizons are in the Btg horizon in many pedons.  In some pedons, the Btg horizon contains small bodies of pyrite.  The presence of pyrite cannot be predicted. Lowering the water table can result in the pyrite reacting to form acids that may lower the pH in local spots within the horizon to 3.5 or less.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand with pockets or lenses of loamy material. Content of shell fragments ranges from none to about 50 percent by volume."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Malabar soils are in sloughs, depressions, and along flood plains in the Southern Florida Flatwoods, the Southern Florida Lowlands, Florida Everglades and Associated Areas and the South Central Florida Ridge. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments. The climate is humid subtropical. The average annual temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 53 to 57 inches."

Boca, Felda and Floridana soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick. In addition, Boca soils hare moderately deep to limestone bedrock and Floridana soils are Mollisols. EauGallie, Farmton, Myakka, Oldsmar and Wabasso soils have spodic horizons. The poorly drained Ft. Drum soils are on similar to slightly higher positions and have Bk horizons. Lokosee and Valkaria soils have weakly expressed spodic horizons. Hallandale soils are shallow to limestone bedrock. Pineda and the poorly drained Riviera soils are Arenic Glossaqualfs. The poorly drained Winder soils have an argillic horizon within a depth of 20 inches."

Some areas are used for citrus crops, truck crops, and improved pasture with adequate water control. Native vegetation consists of scattered slash pine, cypress wax myrtle, cabbage palm, pineland threeawn, and maidencane. In depressions, the vegetation is dominantly St. Johnswort or maidencane."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Malabar soils were formerly mapped in the Charlotte series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 14 inches (A & E horizons).\nAlbic horizon - the zone between depths of 5 to 14 inches (E1 and E2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - the zone between depths of 45 to 54 inches (Btg horizon).\nThe water table is within depths of 10 inches for 2 to 6 months during most years and can recede to a depth of more than 40 inches in extended dry periods. Depressions are ponded for periods ranging from 3 to 6 months in most years. Flood plains are inundated for periods ranging from 7 days to 1 month in most years.\nMalabar soils are primarily in MLRA 155, but are also in MLRAs 154, 156A and 156B.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http;://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nLaboratory data was provided by the Soil Characterization Lab, IFAS, Univ. of Florida, Gainesville, FL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
