  "OVERVIEW": "The Macomb series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in outwash and the underlying till on lake plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

The Macomb soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Kendallville soils, the moderately well drained Cadmus soils, and the very poorly drained Berville soils. The finer textured Blount soils and the Conover soils, which do not have gravelly 2C horizons, are associated on till plains. The moderately well drained Ionia soils and somewhat poorly drained Matherton soils, which are fine loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, are associated where till plains join outwash plains."
