    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe soil moisture control section is affected by precipitation that falls evenly through the year, with a slight increase in the late summer and fall.  This soil crosses precipitation zones that are considered to be Typic Aridic and Ustic Aridic.  However, drier aspects and steep slopes offset the additional moisture in the Ustic Aridic zone.  The soil moisture regime is typic aridic.\nMean annual soil temperature:  47 to 51 degrees F.\nDepth to paralithic contact:  20 to 40 inches to shale\nThe surface is covered with 0 to 60 percent gravel and cobbles.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 5 to 15 percent.\nParticle-size control section:  27 to 35 percent clay, 15 to 35 percent fine sand or coarser, and 0 to 15 percent parachanners\nA horizon:\nHue:  2.5YR through 7.5YR\nValue:  5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma:  2 through 6\nTexture:  clay loam or cobbly clay loam\nRock fragments:  0 to 25 percent gravel and cobbles\nReaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline\nC horizon:\nThe C horizon is horizontal beds of variegated, stratified weathered shale, siltstone and fine grained sandstone that slakes in water.\nHue:  dominantly 2.5YR through 7.5YR with thin layers of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y\nValue:  4 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist\nChroma:  2 through 6\nTexture:  clay loam, or silty clay loam\nReaction:  moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline\nGeogenic Gypsum: 1 to 10 percent"

Greybull soils have soil moisture control sections that are influenced by half the yearly precipitation falling during the months of April through June.  Greybull soils also have lithochromic hues that are dominantly more yellow than 7.5YR.  Teapo soils have more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser and have hue more yellow than 7.5YR."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 36 inches.  (C2 and C3 horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from the surface to a depth of 2 inches.  ( A horizon)\nGypsum:  Geogenic gypsum is present in the zone from 2 to 36 inches.  (C1, C2, and C3 horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with shale at 36 inches.  (Cr horizon)\nThese soils are located in an area that ranges up to 12 inches of precipitation , which is typically an Ustic Aridic zone in Utah.  However, the interaction of  physical conditions (i.e., dry aspects and steep slopes) and moisture, only allow desert plant communities to predominate.  Thus, the soil moisture regime is more reflective of Typic Aridic.\nType location moved to Uintah County because of vague original location description.\nThe type location profile description was reviewed, updated, and revised to meet current standards on 2/1999.  Horizon designations were modified in 2014 to remove the \"y\" suffix from C horizons, because the gypsum is described as being geogenic, or inherent in the parent materials.  This series should be re-evaluated in the future to confirm the gypsum is dominantly geogenic, and not secondary pedogenic accumulations.\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
