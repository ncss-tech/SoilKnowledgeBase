  "OVERVIEW": "The Moncisco series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from sandstone and in residuum derived from fractured porcelanite. Moncisco soils are on footslopes and backslopes of hills and have moderate permeability in the upper profile and very rapid permeability below. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Moncisco soils are on footslopes and backslopes of hills underlain by beds of fractured porcelanite. The porcelanite occurs as baked and fused shale and sandstone associated with burned coal seams of the Cretaceous Fruitland and Menefee Formations. Moncisco soils formed in eolian material derived from Cretaceous sandstone and residuum derived from fractured porcelanite. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,600 to 6,300 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."
