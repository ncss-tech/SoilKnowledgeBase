The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  Depth to paralithic bedrock ranges from 12 to 20 inches and to lithic bedrock below 20 inches.  The solum contains from 5 to 10 percent pebbles and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  The solum may contain up to 50 percent paragravel fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam or loam with 22 to 30 percent clay, and has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure."

These soils formed in medium to moderately fine textured colluvium over semiconsolidated sediments.  The climate is semiarid with hot summers and cold winters; mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F., mean winter temperature is 32 to 33 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The frost-free period is 70 to 150 days."
