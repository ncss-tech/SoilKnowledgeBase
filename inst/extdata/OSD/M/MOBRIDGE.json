  "OVERVIEW": "The Mobridge series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in colluvial-alluvial sediments. They are mainly in upland swales.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 17 to 50 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 47 inches thick and includes part or all of the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1, but has chroma of 2 in some pedons.  It typically is silt loam but is silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is moderately acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is silty clay loam, but some pedons are clay loam averaging between 27 and 35 percent clay.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  The Bt horizon typically contains few fine or very fine accumulations of carbonate in the lower part and the matrix typically is noncalcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonate and is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Thin strata of loam, clay loam, or silty clay are between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  Glacial till or sand and gravel are between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons.  Buried horizons are present in the C horizon in some pedons."

Goshen soils typically have moist chroma of 2 or more in the A horizon, are leached of carbonates to greater depths, and are in a warmer climate.  Hall soils typically are leached of carbonates to greater depths and are in a more moist climate.  Kuma soils have polygenetic profiles.  Simpatico soils have redder hue in the argillic horizon and have a more uniform distribution of rainfall throughout the year."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mobridge soils are in upland swales, slight depressions, drainageways, fans, and foot slopes.  Surfaces are plain or concave.  Slope gradients typically are less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mobridge soils formed in local silty colluvial-alluvial sediments derived dominantly from silty glacial drift and loess.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches."

Agar, Akaska, Eakin, Highmore, and Lowry soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and are on nearby higher parts of the landscapes.  In addition, Lowry soils do not have an argillic horizon and have a coarse-silty control section.  Hoven soils have a natric horizon and are in depressions.  Onita soils are in similar positions and have a fine textured argillic horizon.  Tetonka soils are poorly drained and are in depressions."
