  "OVERVIEW": "The Mobeetie series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous, sandy alluvium and colluvium derived from the Ogallala Formation of Mio-Pliocene age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping valley flats or gently sloping to steep valley side or scarp. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 496 mm (20 in) and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
