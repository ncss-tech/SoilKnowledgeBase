The soils have formed in material weathered from mudstone, shale, and diatomaceous rock with intermixed gypsum crystals of the Moreno formation.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  Mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 81 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.  The frost free season is 220 to 245 days."
