  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout the soil but commonly is 25 to 35 percent in the lower part of the solum and substratum. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Ap or A horizon have hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loam to sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is commonly weak or moderate, fine or medium granular, but ranges to subangular blockly. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is loam to sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak, fine to coarse, subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with properties similar to the Bw but include massive in the structure range.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is loam to sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. It is massive and may have plate-like divisions. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe R or 2R horizon is crystalline bedrock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bice, Dummerstown, Elka, Flatiron, Haights, Lombard, and Mongaup series in the same family. Bice, Dummerston, Elka, Flatiron  and Lombard soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Haights soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock and are underlain by poorly sorted water deposited materials. Mongaup soils are underlain by sedimentary rock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Millsite soils are nearly level to very steep with slopes ranging from 0 to 50 percent. The Millsite soils are on bedrock controlled landscapes where a moderately thick mantle of till material covers crystalline rocks. The bedrock is primarily granite-gneiss but the range includes schist. Mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F; mean annual precipitation is 38 to 52 inches and mean annual growing season is from 100 to 140 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Insula, Ruse and Quetioc soils on bedrock controlled landscapes. Insula soils are shallow and well drained. Ruse soils are shallow and somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained. Quetioc soils are very shallow and somewhat excessively drained."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The use of this frigid series in 144A and 145 seems doubtful, but was not removed at this time.\nThe type location should be an MuC unit according to the site description in the Jefferson County, NY soil survey publication. The location given is in an MuE unit.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 6 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 20 inches below the soil surface (Bw horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
