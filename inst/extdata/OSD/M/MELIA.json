  "OVERVIEW": "The Melia series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on broad, stable interfluves on uplands and on treads on loess covered stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 710 millimeters at the type location.",
