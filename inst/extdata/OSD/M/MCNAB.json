  "OVERVIEW": "The McNab series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  McNab soils are in upland swales.  Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
