  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Rainberry is the only other competing series. Rainberry soils occupy slightly lower positions on the landscape and are very poorly drained. Rainberry soils also have a frequently saturated zone within a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface during the 90 days following the summer solstice in normal years."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mashpee soils occur in depressions, drainageways, terraces, and are adjacent to swamps and bogs on glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine landforms. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. They formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits of late Wisconsin age derived mainly from granite, gneiss, and/or schist. Elevation ranges from about sea level through 250 m. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 through 1270 mm; mean annual temperature ranges from 7 through 11 degrees C; mean growing season ranges from 100 through 195 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Mashpee soils are part of a topo-sequence that includes excessively drained Carver and Windsor soils, moderately well drained Deerfield soils, and very poorly drained Rainberry, Freetown, Scarboro, and Swansea soils. Mashpee soils are associated on similar landscape positions with Massasoit soils which have an ortstein layer and Wareham soils which lack a spodic horizon."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are forested. Some are used for hay or pastureland, and some areas are used for cranberry or blueberry production. Common trees include American holly, dogwood, eastern hemlock, gray birch, pitch pine, red maple, tupelo, eastern white pine, and white oak. The sapling and shrub layer commonly consists of speckled alders, sweet pepperbush, high bush blueberry, green briar, and swamp azalea. The herbaceous layer typically consists of cinnamon fern, sphagnum moss, teaberry, and starflower."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Mashpee series is proposed to recognize poorly drained, sandy Endoaquods in mesic soil areas of the glaciated northeast. These soils were historically mapped as the Pipestone series which originates outside region R, receives less annual precipitation and is somewhat poorly drained. The series name originates from the Mashpee Pitted Plain of Barnstable County Massachusetts.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 28 cm (O, AE, and E horizons)\n2. Albic horizon - the zone from 19 to 28 cm (E horizon)\n3. Spodic horizon - the zone from 28 to 43 cm (Bh1 and Bh2 horizons the Bs horizon may be part of the spodic horizon but characterization data is required to determine this.)\n4. Aquic conditions and Aquods suborder - redox features in the albic and spodic horizons within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
