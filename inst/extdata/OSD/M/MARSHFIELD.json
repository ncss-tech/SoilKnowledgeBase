  "OVERVIEW": "The Marshfield series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess or silty alluvium and in the underlying loamy glacial till on ground moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle and moderately slow in the underlying till. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Thickness of loess or silty alluvium ranges from 12 to 36 inches.  The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 35 percent clay and between 15 and 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle and from 3 to 35 percent in the till.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 10 percent in the till.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum.  Redox features typically are throughout the profile.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are 50 percent or more of the matrix in at least the upper 5 inches of the argillic horizon.  Saturation occurs at or near the surface much of the year.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Value dry is 5 or less\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silt.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Cg or 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 4.
