Arritola soils have Bw horizons with 25 to 35 percent clay.  Besslen soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Chiara soils have over 40 inches to bedrock.  Coltroop soils average 20 to 30 percent clay in the control section. Frohman soils have a thin duripan that is rippable, and bedrock is deeper than 40 inches.  Gremmers soils lack bedrock below the duripan.  Nevoyer soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 inches.  OToole soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Peeko soils have 15 to 35 percent gravel and 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section.  Plegomir soils lack bedrock below the duripan.  Scoon soils have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser particles, with up to 35 percent gravel.  Tenvorrd and Truvar soils are greater than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Yahoo soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Minveno soils are on hills, buttes, pressure ridges, tumuli, plus domes (bettes), lava flow lobes and structural benches on lava plains and shield volcanoes, calderas, structural benches, and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent. The soils formed in silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash.  Elevations are 2,900 to 5,000 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The average annual temperature is 46 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 95 to 150 days."

Principle irrigated crops are alfalfa hay, barley, dry beans and peas, wheat, corn, and corn silage."

There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe term silty alluvium used in this series concept infers a localized influence on the mixed loess and weathered volcanic ash mantle by overland flow of running water.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
