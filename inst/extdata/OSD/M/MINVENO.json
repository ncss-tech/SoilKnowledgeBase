  "OVERVIEW": "The Minveno series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils on plains, buttes, benches, terraces, and hills.  They formed silty alluvium from loess and weathered volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Arritola soils have Bw horizons with 25 to 35 percent clay.  Besslen soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Chiara soils have over 40 inches to bedrock.  Coltroop soils average 20 to 30 percent clay in the control section. Frohman soils have a thin duripan that is rippable, and bedrock is deeper than 40 inches.  Gremmers soils lack bedrock below the duripan.  Nevoyer soils have bedrock within a depth of 20 inches.  OToole soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Peeko soils have 15 to 35 percent gravel and 18 to 27 percent clay in the control section.  Plegomir soils lack bedrock below the duripan.  Scoon soils have more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser particles, with up to 35 percent gravel.  Tenvorrd and Truvar soils are greater than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Yahoo soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the control section."

There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe term silty alluvium used in this series concept infers a localized influence on the mixed loess and weathered volcanic ash mantle by overland flow of running water.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
