  "REVDATE": "10/2014",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Morado series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on summits and side slopes of hills and mountains of the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in residuum that weathered from basalt flow and tuff.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches.  Slopes range from 12 to 60 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness range from 10 to 30 inches.  Depth to the semi-consolidated volcanic rock range from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Content of parapebbles is less than 5 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Masses and splotches in shades of yellow, red, and brown range from none to common.  These colors are derived from the parent material and are not indicative of wetness.  Content of parapebbles ranges from 0 to 25 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma 1 or 2; or has no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray.  These colors are derived from the parent material and are not indicative of wetness.  Content of parapebbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of red, brown, yellow and gray.  Original rock structure is visible and weathered rock fragments can be easily broken between fingers. Low chroma mottles appear to have been inherited from the parent material and are not thought to due to wetness.  Content of parapebbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent, by volume.  Texture is loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, is composed of highly fractured and moderately weathered volcanic rock. It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment.\nThe R horizon is composed of hard, semi-consolidated volcanic rock."
