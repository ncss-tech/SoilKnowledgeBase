    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Deadmanbay, Doolyville, Killebrew, Quatama and Stockel series. Deadmanbay soils have a densic contact between 40 and 60 inches. Doolyville soils are very deep, and are 30 to 50 cm to redoximorphic features. Killebrew soils are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days, have a massive E horizon, with a bulk density of more than 1.8 g/cm3, and a hard dry rupture resistance. Quatama soils do not have redoximorphic features above 15 inches, an albic horizon, or a densic contact. Stockel soils do not have an albic horizon or a densic contact. The Wellsdale series has similar classification but an active cation-exchange activity class. Wellsdale soils do not have redoximorphic features above 20 inches, an albic horizon, or a densic contact."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mitchellbay soils are in valleys of glacial drift plains. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. These soils formed in glacial drift over dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations are 0 to 500 feet. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and mild moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches. Mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 200 to 240 days."
