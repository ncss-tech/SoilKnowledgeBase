  "OVERVIEW": "The Mann series consists of deep, very poorly drained soils formed in loess or silty alluvium and in the underlying loamy till on ground moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle moderately slow in the till.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 24 to 50 inches. Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Rock fragments typically are absent in the silty mantle. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the till. Volume of cobbles or stones range from 0 to 10 percent in the till.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline throughout the soil. Carbonates are absent to a depth of 60 inches or more.   Redox accumulations are in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and saturation occurs within a depth of 1 foot for some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is silt loam. Some uncultivated pedons have an organic surface layer up to 7 inches thick.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a 2Bg horizon with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2BCg horizon has color like the 2Bg horizon. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with color and texture like the 2Bg above except that chroma is 3 or 4.\nThe 2C or 2Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.

Some areas are used for pastureland and a few areas have been drained and are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grains, and hay."
