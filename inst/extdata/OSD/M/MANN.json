  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 24 to 50 inches. Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Rock fragments typically are absent in the silty mantle. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the till. Volume of cobbles or stones range from 0 to 10 percent in the till.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline throughout the soil. Carbonates are absent to a depth of 60 inches or more.   Redox accumulations are in the lower part of the mollic epipedon and saturation occurs within a depth of 1 foot for some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is silt loam. Some uncultivated pedons have an organic surface layer up to 7 inches thick.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a 2Bg horizon with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe 2BCg horizon has color like the 2Bg horizon. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with color and texture like the 2Bg above except that chroma is 3 or 4.\nThe 2C or 2Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam."

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in a mantle of loess or silty alluvium and in the underlying loamy till of early Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 28 to 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 40 to 45 degrees F."

The moderately well drained Loyal and somewhat poorly drained Withee soils form a drainage sequence with the Mann soils.  Marshfield soils are on similar landscape positions but do not have a mollic epipedon."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to low. Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle and moderately slow in the till.  This soil has a perched seasonal high water table from 1 foot above to 1 foot below the surface for much of the time from September to June in most years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas remain in native vegetation which is mostly grasses and sedges with some shrubs, such as alder and willow and some patches of deciduous trees such as American elm and white ash. Some areas are used for pastureland and a few areas have been drained and are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grains, and hay."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The silty mantle may have some loess influence, but since these soils are in depressions and drainageways, some sorting of or addition of sand by water is probable.  These soils were formerly included with the Adolph series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - 0 to 13 inches (Ap, A); cambic horizon - 13 to 34 inches (Bg1, Bg2, 2BCg); aquic suborder  prominent redox accumulations in the lower part of the mollic epipedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
