  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to hard andesitic rock ranges from 25 to 50 cm. The profile contains 15 to 35 percent gravel, cobbles and/or stones. Mean annual soil temperature varies from 4 degrees to 7 degrees C., and the mean summer soil temperature varies from 12 degrees to 15 degrees C. Base saturation is less than 50 percent throughout the upper 18 to 25 cm of the profile. Bulk density ranges from 0.85 to 1.0, however the exchange complex is dominated by amorphous material. Glass content ranges from 5 to 10 percent of the less than 2mm fraction. 15 bar water retention is about 14 to 20 percent. Organic matter is as high 12 percent and decreases regularly with depth.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4 and 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/3 in the upper 7 inches after mixing and 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/4 in the lower part. It is loam or sandy loam and may be gravelly, cobbly or stony. It ranges from neutral to moderately acid."

Elevations are 1830 to 3050 meters. The climate is humid with warm to cool dry summers and very cold moist winters. There are infrequent summer thundershowers. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 2030 mm, most of which occurs as snow. The mean annual temperature is 4 degrees C.; mean January temperature is -3 degrees C.; and mean July temperature is 13 degrees C. Frost-free season is 30 to 50 days."
