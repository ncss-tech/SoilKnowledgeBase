Mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F. Reaction of all mineral horizons is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue ranging from 5YR through 10YR.\nThe C horizons have hue from 5YR through 10YR, value moist from 3 through 5, and chroma moist from 2 through 4.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 80 percent gravel.  Texture is dominantly silt loam but ranges to include sandy loam or loam.  Chroma of 2 or less and mottling are present in part of the C horizons in all pedons.\nThe 2Cd horizon is compact till with moist bulk density more than 1.80 grams/cm3."
