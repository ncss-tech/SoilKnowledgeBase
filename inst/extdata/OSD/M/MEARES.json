  "OVERVIEW": "The Meares series consists of shallow soils to a paralithic contact of compact till.  These very poorly drained soils formed in glacial drift on gently sloping to very steep mountainsides.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent slopes.  Mean annual precipitation is about 120 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

Mean summer soil temperature is about 46 degrees F. Reaction of all mineral horizons is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue ranging from 5YR through 10YR.\nThe C horizons have hue from 5YR through 10YR, value moist from 3 through 5, and chroma moist from 2 through 4.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 80 percent gravel.  Texture is dominantly silt loam but ranges to include sandy loam or loam.  Chroma of 2 or less and mottling are present in part of the C horizons in all pedons.\nThe 2Cd horizon is compact till with moist bulk density more than 1.80 grams/cm3."
