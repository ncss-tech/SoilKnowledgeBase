  "OVERVIEW": "The Mollman series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy till or colluvium.  These soils are on moraines, hills, and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
