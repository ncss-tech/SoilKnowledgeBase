  "OVERVIEW": "The Mesa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and alluvium. Mesa soils are on stream terraces, fan remnants, mesas, and pediments. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
