  "REVDATE": "11/1999",
  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Monchego series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and outwash derived from andesite, rhyolite, breccia, or tuff.  These soils are on outwash fans and outwash terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
