  "OVERVIEW": "The Maudrey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from Dakota sandstone.  Maudrey soils are on mesas.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
