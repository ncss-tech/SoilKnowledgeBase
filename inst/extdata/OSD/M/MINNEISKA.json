    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have free carbonates in all parts.  The average calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section is less than 10 percent.  These soils usually do not have rock fragments, but some pedons have as much as 10 percent.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is stratified in color.  It has strata with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has mottles in the lower part of the control section in most pedons.  It is stratified in texture with two or more of the following textural classes; silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, and sand.  However, it averages coarse-loamy particle-size.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nA 2C horizon begins at depths as shallow as 25 inches in some pedons. It is stratified in color with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It dominantly has sandy particle-size with texture of sand, fine sand, loamy sand, and loamy fine sand being dominant.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Moderately well and somewhat poorly drained Spillville soils are fine-loamy and well and moderately well drained Zumbro soils are sandy.  Both of these soils occupy slightly higher positions on floodplains."
