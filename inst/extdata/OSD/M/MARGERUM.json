These soils are usually dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches. The mollic epipedon is 12 to 16 inches thick. Content of coarse fragments (dominantly pumice) in the control section ranges from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, medium granular structure. It is neutral or slightly acid. The B2 horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is gravelly clay loam to gravelly silt loam. This horizon has weak to moderate blocky or prismatic structure. It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has the same color range as the B2 horizon. It is silt loam or gravelly silt loam. This horizon is massive or has weak structure. It is neutral or mildly alkaline. Some pedons contain thin lenses with more than 50 percent pumice."

Bjork soils have bedrock at depth of less than 40 inches. Colma, Dragoon, Galeppi, Glenrose, Lobitos, Los Gatos, Melhorn, Schumacher, and Sweeney soils are usually moist. Cowiche, Simcoe, and Tieton soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments in the control section. Elmore soils have secondary carbonates within depth of 43 inches. Indiano soils have bedrock at depth of 20 to 33 inches. Sallyann soils have base saturation of less than 75 percent. Springmeyer soils have sola 20 to 28 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in loess containing 20 to 40 percent ash and pumice, deposited over nonsorted glacial drift or acid igneous bedrock. The climate is semiarid; summers are hot and dry and winters are moist and cold. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches. Mean January temperature is 37 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees to 50 degrees F.; and average frost-free season is 160 to 180 days."

The Chelan soils contain 60 to 90 percent pyroclastics in the control section, formed in nonsorted gravelly or cobbly glacial drift deposits and occur below the Margerum soils. Alstown soils have a lower pumice content and are underlain with basic igneous bedrock."
