  "OVERVIEW": "The Moosejaw series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in moderately coarse alluvium from mixed sources over coarse alluvium from granite or other coarse grained, igneous or metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on floodplains and drainageways in foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
