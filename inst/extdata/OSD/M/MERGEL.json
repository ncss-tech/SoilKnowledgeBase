  "OVERVIEW": "The Mergel series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and mixed glacial materials.  Mergel soils are on concave mountain side slopes, on hills and ridges and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches.  The depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 12 inches.  Content of organic carbon ranges from .7 to 1.5 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  The soils are 90 to 100 percent base saturated.  The control section is channery or very channery loam or clay loam, with the fine earth fraction ranging in clay from 18 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are usually channers or flagstones, but are gravel or cobbles in some pedons.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  It is calcareous in some pedons.  Usually this horizon has granular structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6).  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from approximately 4 to 12 percent."
