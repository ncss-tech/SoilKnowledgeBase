  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches.  The depth to calcareous material ranges from 0 to 12 inches.  Content of organic carbon ranges from .7 to 1.5 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  The soils are 90 to 100 percent base saturated.  The control section is channery or very channery loam or clay loam, with the fine earth fraction ranging in clay from 18 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and are usually channers or flagstones, but are gravel or cobbles in some pedons.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.  It is calcareous in some pedons.  Usually this horizon has granular structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6).  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from approximately 4 to 12 percent."

The soils formed in allvuial fan or facial sediments derived from crystalline rocks or sandstone.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 44 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 60 degrees F.  the frost-free season mean annual temperature is 105 days."
