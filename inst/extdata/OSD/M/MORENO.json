  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges from 33 to 55 inches thick.  Coarse fragments are sandstone, shale, and acid igneous rocks.  Gravel makes up about 50 percent, cobbles about 40 percent, and stones about 10 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent of the A horizon, from 0 to 15 percent of the upper part of the B2t horizon, from 10 to 30 percent of the lower part of the B2t horizon, and from 10 to 35 percent of the C horizon.\nTh A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, sandy clay loam or sandy loam and is 18 to 30 percent clay.\nThe B21t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is clay loam or clay and is 35 to 50 percent clay.  The B22t and B23t horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5 YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry.  They are similar to the B21t horizon in texture.  The B2t horizon ranges from 27 to 44 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, and value of 4 or 5 dry.  It is clay, clay loam or sandy clay and is 35 to 50 percent clay."

Capillo and Wilcoxson soils have Bt horizons less than 27 inches thick.  Darret and Pino soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have Bt horizons less than 27 inches thick.  Fergus soils have lime accumulations at depths of 20 to 36 inches.  Terrad soils have 50 percent or more clay in the Bt horizon.  Turkeysprings soils contain free carbonates throughout the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moreno soils are on valley sides.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Elevation ranges from 7,000 to 9,000 feet.  The soils formed in fine textured material weathered from sandstone, shale, and acid igneous intrusive rocks.  The climate is subhumid continental with an annual temperature of about 39 to 45 degrees F. and summer temperature of about 59 degrees F.  The annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 18 inches with more than 60 percent falling during the frost free which lasts for 80 to 110 days."
