At higher elevations, they also occupy west-facing similar landscape positions.  Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.  They formed in sandy glacial outwash with minor amounts of volcanic ash mixed in the surface layers.  Elevations range from 2,300 to 4,500 feet.  The average annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches.  The average frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
