The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 40 percent material coarser than very fine sand including 0 to 5 percent rock fragments.  Apparent clay in the particle-size control section is 18 to 35 percent.  Based on 15-bar water content the clay is more than 60 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry; and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, and 2 through 4 dry.  It is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry; and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  Apparent field texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Estimated clay (by 15 bar water) is 40 to 60 percent.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 8 dry; and chroma of 3 through 8 moist and dry.  The highly weathered tuff varies greatly in color from pedon to pedon, and can be multicolored in a single pedon.  Apparent field texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Gymer, Oska, Otley, Polo, Sharpsburg, and Wenona series.  All of these soils are colder in winter and warmer in summer than Mulholland soils.  In addition, Gymer soils have a mollic epipedon that includes the upper part of the argillic horizon and have a mean annual temperature of 54 to 58 degrees F.  Oska soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Otley are moderately well drained and have high chroma mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Polo soils have a mollic epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick that includes part of the argillic horizon.  Sharpsburg soils are less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  Wenona soils are moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the argillic horizon and have a lithologic discontinuity in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mulholland soils are on, toe slopes, mountainsides, and broad ridgetops at elevations of 500 to 1,800 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  Steeper slopes are associated with highly dissected topography.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from highly weathered tuff and tuffaceous breccia of Eocene age with some volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  The climate is marine and characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches, mostly as rainfall that falls during the winter.  The average January temperature is 35 degrees F.  The average July temperature is 63 degrees F.  These soils never freeze.   The average annual air temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 175 to 200 days."

In addition, Cinebar and Newaukum soils have a bulk density of less than 0.85g./cc in the upper part of the particle-size control section.  Gobar soils are more than 35 percent weathered rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Pheeney soils are medial-skeletal, 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact, and have a frigid temperature regime.  Siouxon soils are medial-skeletal.  Xeno soils are frigid."
