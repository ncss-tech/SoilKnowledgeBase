  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Buried horizons are common but not diagnostic.  Solum thickness is 30 to more than 60 inches.  These soils are calcareous throughout the 10 to 40 inch control section and have soft powdery lime within 30 inches of the soil surface. Cracks more than 1 cm wide extend from the surface to depths of about 30 inches during some season in most years.  The clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent. Slickensides range from few to common.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Clay content is 35 to 60 percent and COLE exceeds 0.07.  This horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Ab horizon has colors similar to the Bw horizon.  It is silt loam through clay with a clay content of 25 to 50 percent and a reaction similar to the Bw horizon.  Where the Ab or C horizon has less than 35 percent clay, it occurs at depths of 35 to 60 inches below the surface.\nWhere present, the C horizon is similar in color, and reaction to the Bw horizon.  Texture includes clay, silty clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, and silt loam.  It contains thin, dark or light colored strata of loamy and sandy material.  Some pedons contain gypsum crystals."

Ashport, Port, and Spur soils have less than 35 percent clay in the textural control section and COLE less than 0.07.  Frio and Volente soils have a COLE of less than 0.07, and are warmer.  Mangum soils lack a mollic epipedon and are dryer.  Moreland and Roebuck soils have a udic soil moisture regime and lack soft powdery lime within 30 inches of the soil surface. Nukrum soils are well drained, moderately permeable, and have a regular decrease in organic matter.  Rioconcho soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods of time.  Krum and Trinity soils are warmer and have smectitic mineralogy."

In addition, Gaddy, Pulaski, and Yahola soils have less than 18 percent clay in the textural control section.  Ashport, and Port soils have less than 35 percent clay in the textural control section."
