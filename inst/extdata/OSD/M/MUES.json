    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist and is dry between the depths of about 4 and 12 inches less than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 53 degrees F.  Under native vegetation, the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  Depth to the massive consolidated substratum is 25 to 40 inches.  The solum has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and has a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85g/cubic centimeter.  It is estimated to have a phosphate retention of more than 85 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 2.0 percent. The solum is extremely acid or very strongly acid.  Depth to redoximorphic concentrations is 24 to 36 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent by field estimate.  Organic matter is 8 to 12 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Clay content is 15 to 25 percent by field estimate.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 moist and dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is strongly consolidated with 40 to 65 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles.  It is very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly loam."
