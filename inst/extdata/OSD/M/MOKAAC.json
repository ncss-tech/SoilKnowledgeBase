  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mokaac series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium derived from sedimentary formations high in gypsum and calcium carbonate.  Mokaac soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
