These soils formed in mixed alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Era soils are somewhat excessively drained soils and are on adjacent fan terraces."
