  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section averages between 18 and 35 percent clay.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 6 inches. The electrical conductivity ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos per cubic centimeter.  It typically contains 1 to 10 percent gravel.  Surfaces are very stony in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 to 4, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam or clay loam, but ranges from silty clay loam to sandy loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a By horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 4.  It typically is loam, but is clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons there are thin strata of sandy or clayey sediments.  Some pedons do not have gypsum.  Some pedons have layers of sandy or clayey sediments below 40 inches."

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 15 to 24 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lallie, Minnewasta, Minnewaukan and Wamduska soils on glacial lake plains and beaches.  Lallie and Minnewaukan soils are below and Wamduska soils are above the Mauvais soils on the landscape.  Minnewasta soils occur on positions similar to the Mauvais soils.  They have 10 to 20 inches of sandy materials over glacial till.  Lallie soils do not have coarse fragments and formed in fine textured lacustrine sediments.  Minnewaukan and Wamduska soils are sandy.  Wamduska soils are excessively drained and Lallie soils are poorly drained."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is very slow or medium.  Permeability is moderately slow.  A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 1.5 to 3.0 feet below the surface at some time during the period of March through July.  This soil receives runoff and seepage from higher lying areas.  In some of the level and nearly level areas of this soil ponding occurs in a cyclic pattern.  The soil may be ponded for several years with several feet of water and then not ponded again for many years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Mauvais soils are used for hay, range, pasture, and wildlife.  Native vegetation is sedges, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, leadplant and prairie cordgrass.  Ponded areas may be open water and are revegetated by grasses as the water recedes."
