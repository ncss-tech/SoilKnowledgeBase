Rock fragments make up 0 to 30 percent of the solum and 0 to 70 percent of the C horizon. The soil ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. It is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 5. It is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons do not have a BA horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction."

Gilpin soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Jefferson soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: CEC activity data from Shenandoah Co. Verginia NASIS data.\n1. These soils have previously been included in the Lily series.\n2. The major diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 4 inches (A and BA horizons).\nb. Argillic horizon - The zone from 4 to 21 inches (Bt horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle size, chemical, and sand mineralogy data from the site location are available from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.\nThe 12/2005 revision updates this soil to the 9th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy (2003). The CEC activity class placement may have been based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 5/89\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
