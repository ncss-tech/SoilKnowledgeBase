Momoli soils are also very deep, and form in alluvium and eolian deposits. Laposa soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Snapcan soils have 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle size control section, and form in colluvium and residuum derived from fanglomerate."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from gneiss, granite and/or other granitoid rocks. Elevations range from 440 to 1,150 meters (1,445 to 3,770 feet). The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C. (63 to 73 degrees F.).  The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."

Bulletproof soils are on similar landscape positions, but Bulletproof soils have no diagnostic subsurface horizons and are less than 36 centimeters to a paralithic contact. Contactmine and Seanna soils are on cooler mountain backslopes and have a warm thermic soil temperature regime. In addition, Contactmine soils are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section, are not skeletal and have an argillic horizon above the paralithic contact. Jadestorm soils are typically near areas of rock outcrop, are shallow to a paralithic contact, and have a loamy-skeletal particle size control section. Seanna soils do not have a diagnostic horizon above a shallow paralithic contact."
