The 10 to 40 inch pscs has 25 to 35 percent clay. Rock fragments are commonly absent in the texture control section but the content ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the BC and C horizons. The solum has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick. Depth to aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less, with or without redox concentrations is 20 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe AB or BA horizons, when present, have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The McBee soils are at elevations of 25 to 1,000 feet in flat depressed terrraces often some distance from large streams, and in flat flood plain areas adjacent to small streams. The soils formed in silty and loamy alluvium from mixed sedimentary and igneous sources. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The mean January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."

Chehalis soils are well drained. Wapato soils are poorly drained and occur in depressions on flood plains. Cloquato soils are well drained and coarse-silty. Newberg soils are somewhat excessively drained. Cloquato, Newberg, and Chehalis soils are on higher flood plains."
