  "OVERVIEW": "The McBee series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered mostly from sedimentary and basic igneous bedrock. They are on flood plains and low terraces. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
