  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the fine textured strata ranges from 16 to 36 inches.  In a few places the soil contains a few coarse fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 76 degrees F.  The organic matter decreases irregularly with increasing depth.  The soils have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The upper 16 to 36 inches of the soil averages fine sandy loam that contains less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  The sand is dominantly fine.  Individual strata range from fine sand to silt loam.  Layers below a depth of 16 to 36 inches and down to a depth of 40 inches or more are silty clay loam, silty clay or clay that contain 35 to 55 percent clay.  In some places, the fine textured strata have vertical tongues 1/2 to 2 inches wide of soil of texture like that of the overlying horizons.  These are fillings in old cracks.  The strata throughout the soil are massive or have platy structure due to stratification.  The plowed layer may have structure that was formed by tillage.  Lime is usually disseminated but both lime and gypsum are in soft bodies or concretions in some places.  Generally, the soil ranges from mildly to moderately alkaline, but a few pedons have individual strata that are strongly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Meloland soils are in nearly level lacustrine basins and flood plains in the deserts at elevations of about 700 feet above to 230 feet below sea level. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is less than 4 inches and can range from 3 to 7 inches in Arizona; the average January temperature about 50 degrees to 52 degrees F., the average July temperature about 90 degrees F., and the average annual temperature 70 to 75 degrees F. The frost-free period is 250 to 350."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Antho, Holtville, Imperial, Indio, and Niland soils.  Antho and Indio soils lack clay or silty clay textures within the 10- to 40- inch control section.  Holtville soils have clayey over loamy textures in the 10- to 40- inch control section.  Imperial soils are silty clay or clay to a depth of 40 or more inches.  Niland soils are sand in the upper part and clay in the lower part of the 10- to 40-inch control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  The Meloland soils are naturally well drained, but commonly have perched water tables under irrigation.  Surface runoff is low or medium; permeability is slow.  Tile drains have been used extensively to improve drainage and remove salts in irrigated soils."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly in irrigated cropland.  Major crops are cotton, sugar beets, alfalfa, barley, carrots, and lettuce.  Native vegetation is sparse desert shrubs, principally creosotebush, bursage, jointfir, and mesquite."
