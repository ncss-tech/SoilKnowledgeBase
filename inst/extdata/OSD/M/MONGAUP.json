  "OVERVIEW": "The Mongaup series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in till derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale. They are nearly level through very steep soils on hillsides and hilltops in glaciated, bedrock controlled uplands. Depth to hard bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 45 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 35 percent in the upper part of the solum and up to 50 percent in the lower part of the soil. Unless limed, reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid in the surface layer upper part of the subsoil and extremely acid to moderately acid in the lower part of the subsoil and substratum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 0 through 4. It is sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate granular or blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. O or E horizons are present in some pedons. Where present, the Ap horizon can be up to 12 inches thick.\nA BA horizon up to 6 inches thick is present in some pedons. The Bw and BC horizons have hue of 2.5YR through 2.5Y with value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 6. They are sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Thin Bhs or Bs horizons may be present in some pedons. Some pedons lack redoximorphic features.\nThe C horizon, where present, is similar in color and texture to the B horizon. It is massive or has plate-like divisions.\nThe 2R layer is commonly hard, massive, horizontally-bedded sandstone but thinner beds of siltstone or shale underlie some pedons."

Dummerston soils are very deep to bedrock and has till derived from phyllite, schist, slate, and limestone bedrock. Flatiron soils are formed in residuum from Olean and Knapp conglomerate and are very deep to bedrock. Haights soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock and are underlain by poorly sorted water deposited materials. Lombard soils are very deep to bedrock and have till over saprolite that is underlain by soft bedrock. Millsite series are moderately deep to crystiline bedrock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Mongaup is the frigid equivalent of Lordstown. Original classification of Mongaup placed it in the subgroup Typic Dystrochrepts, but because of changes established in the 8th edition of \"Keys To Soil Taxonomy\", this soil now classifies in the subgroup of Typic Dystrudepts. Competing series are expected to change as similar soils are reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n(1) Ochric Epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (Ap horizon).\n(2) Cambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 18 inches (Bw horizons).\n(3) Udic soil moisture regime\n(4) Estimate CEC activity class as active.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
