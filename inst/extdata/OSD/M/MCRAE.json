  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The McRae soils are usually dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches but are not dry in all parts above 12 inches for more than half the time that soil temperature at 20 inches is more than 41 degrees F.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The solum is 11 to 14 inches thick.  The soil between depths of 10 and 40 inches is loam or light clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sands.  The soil is moderately or strongly alkaline. Conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 1 to 3 millimhos per cm.  These soils are generally nonsaline.  The Ap and B2 horizons are noncalcareous or weakly calcareous. Hue is 10YR through 5Y.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3.5 through 5 moist.  Its granules are coated one-half to one unit of value darker.\nThe B2 horizon has dry and moist value of the crushed soil the same as in the Ap horizon, and has coated colors one-half unit darker.  The chroma is 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 4 moist.  It has less than 5 percent mottles of segregated lime and has an estimated 8 to 12 percent CaC03 equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McRae soils are on terraces of rivers and streams, alluvial fans in valleys, and footslopes in the uplands.  They formed in calcareous loam alluvium from soils developed over sedimentary rocks.  The mineralogy of the alluvium is mixed.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 8 to 14 inches and mean annual temperature of 45 to 50 degrees F."

Bainville, Cushman, Elso and Midway soils are on the uplands occupying hills and ridges, and the Fort Collins and Havre soils are in valleys.  Bainville, Cushman, Elso and Midway soils have shale bedrock at depths ranging shallower than 40 inches, and Cushman and Fort Collins soils have Bt horizons. Havre soils occur on river and stream flood plains and have no horizonation."
