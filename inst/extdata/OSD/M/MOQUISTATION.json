  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Moquistation series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability on limestone-sandstone bedrock. They formed residuum, or slope alluvium over residuum, derived from limestone. Moquistation soils are on ridges, structural benches of mesas and plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
