    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The loamy mantle ranges from 12 to 25 inches thick and the sandy layer between the upper loamy material and till is 10 to 30 inches thick. Typically rock fragments range from 1 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle and glacial till with 0 to 25 percent rock fragments in the sandy layer. The soil moisture control section is dry in one or more horizons for some time in most years.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam. It is very strongly acid to slightly acid. An A horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand, or their gravelly analogues. Thin strata of loamy material are present in some pedons. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. It is moderately acid to neutral."

Balmlake, Emmet, Heyder, and Omena soils have free secondary carbonates within the series control section. Bergkeller, Bootlake, Nadeau, Oconto, Sanburn, and Sugarbush soils have sand and/or gravel within the series control section. Flak and Milaca soils have dense till (paralithic contact) within the series control section. Cunard soils do not have stratified textures within the series control section and also have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Millward soils have plane or convex slopes on crests or sideslopes of moraines. These soils formed in loamy glacial till and water worked sediments. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 30 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 130 days. Elevation ranges from 1,000 to 1,450 feet above sea level."

The well drained Automba, Milaca, Cromwell and Pomroy soils are on nearby landscapes. Automba soils have a glossic horizon. Milaca soils do not have a sandy layer between the loamy mantle and dense till. The moderately well drained Bushville and the well drained Pomroy soils have a sandy mantle 20 to 40 inches thick. The moderately well drained Mora soils are on less sloping and lower lying positions. The poorly drained Ronneby soils are on nearly level slopes. The very poorly drained Twig and Giese soils are in depressions or low lying areas."
