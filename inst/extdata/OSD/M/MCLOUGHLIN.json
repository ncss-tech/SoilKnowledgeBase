  "OVERVIEW": "The McLoughlin series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium weathered from lacustrine sediments.  McLoughlin soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 56 degrees F.  In most years the soils are usually dry but are moist between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 consecutive days or more within the four-month period following the summer solstice and are moist for 60 consecutive days during the winter.  The soils are moderately to strongly saline-alkali throughout.  Some profiles are calcareous throughout and others are calcareous only in the lower part of the profile.  The solum is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam and has 22 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  The solum is stratified with medium and moderately fine textured material washed from adjacent uplands of silty lacustrine sediments.  The profile to depth of 40 inches or more has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  The structure ranges from weak to strong platy and vesicular in the upper few inches of the A horizon and weak or moderate granular or fine or very fine subangular blocky in the lower part of the A horizon and weak to strong prismatic and weak or moderate subangular blocky in the B horizon."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium from old lacustrine sediments.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 to 54 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F., and mean winter temperature is 31 to 33 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 10 inches.  The frost-free period is 110 to 170 days."
