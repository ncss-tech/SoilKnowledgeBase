  "OVERVIEW": "The Mountpoor series consist of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from granogabbro, granodiorite, or rhyolite as sills and dikes in shale of the Mancos formation.  These soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes range from 15 to 65 percent.   Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
