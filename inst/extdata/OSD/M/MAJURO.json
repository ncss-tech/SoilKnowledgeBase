  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Majuro soils are on beach ridges, beach terraces, and beaches, of atolls, karsts, and islands, generally on oceansides of islands. They are dominant under Atoll and Casuarina Forest plant communities. Slope is 0 to 6 percent. Theses soils formed in water- and wind-deposited coralline sand and rubble. Elevation is 0 to 6 meters (0 to 20 feet.) The climate is tropical and moist. Because of the strong marine influence, the diurnal and annual range of temperature is limited. Rainfall averages about 3685 millimeters (145 inches) per year and ranges from approximately 2900 to 4400 mm (114 to 173 in.) The seasonal wet (May to November) and dry seasons (December to April) with the driest months (February, March, and April) averaging 178 to 229 milliliters (7 to 9 inches) per month. Rainfall is derived from convective uplift, which results in short duration rainstorms of high intensity. Rainfall is irregularly distributed geographically. These soils lie within the latitudinal zone that receives more solar radiation than it re-radiates back to space. This imbalance maintains the atmospheric temperatures in a quasi-steady state. The mean daily temperature throughout the year averages 27 C (81 F) with a mean diurnal range of about 4 C (7 F.) Relative humidity averages about 90 percent at night and 75 to 80 percent during the day."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dublon, Ngedebus, Ngerungor, and Odesangel soils. Dublon soils have a water table at 38 to 91 centimeters (15 to 36 inches) depth. Ngedebus soils are near Majuro soils but are generally on the lagoon side of islands and have less than 35 percent coral fragments in the particle-size control section. Odesangel soils formed in depressional areas that retain fresh or brackish water. The soils are derived dominantly from decomposed and partially decomposed freshwater marsh vegetation overlying coral sand. Ngerungor soils have hemic materials greater than 125 centimeters (49 inches), occur in depressional areas and are saturated throughout the profile."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are in casuarina atoll-forest plant communities and are used for native forests, fuelwood, and agroforestry. A few areas are used for homesites or recreation use.  Agroforestry crops is comprised of, Manihot esculenta (cassava), sweet potato, and tomato. Of the total fruit tree, there are banana trees, breadfruit, betel nut, citrus (lemon and lime), coconut trees, guava, mountain apple, and papaya trees.  Native species commonly observed in the overstory of atoll forests include; Casuarina equisetifolia, Calophyllum inophyllum, Hernandia sonora, Guettarda speciosa, Pisonia grandis, Neisosperma oppositifolia, and Ficus spp. Understory forest species include Scaevola taccada, Tournefortia argentea, Pemphis acidula, Pandanus spp., Morinda citrifolia, and Premna obtusifolia. There was little groundcover in the atoll forest plant community. A few areas are in Casuarina forest and are used for recreation.\nAtoll forests provide habitat for coastal wildlife species. The potential to develop and use atoll forest is limited. Atoll forests are generally unsuited for agriculture and agroforestry because of the sandy soils and their close proximity to the ocean and salt spray. Small areas within the atoll forests could be suitable for agroforestry if sufficient organic matter for composting is available.  The atoll forests are generally suitable for coconut (Cocos nucifera) plantings. Untended plantings or natural regeneration of coconuts was observed. The low economic return in coconut plantings would discourage this use of atoll forests."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Majuro soil series was composed of soils published as the Ngedebus Variant in the soil surveys of American Samoa, Kosrae, Palau, and Yap. These soils have a high percentage of coarse fragments and sand. This results in low soil water holding capacity. They are especially susceptible to droughty conditions. The coralline sand parent material is 97 percent calcium carbonate, which is lacking in most essential nutrients. In addition, there is rapid decomposition of soil organic matter. Maintenance of soil fertility requires continual input of plant biomass. Burning the forest as a method of clearing land for agriculture removes the nutrients that have accumulated in the soil humus. Soil chemical properties are not affected by a strong rainfall gradient across the pacific, but human activity has a greater effect on some properties. Managing organic matter is fundamental to the cropping systems on these soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - Surface to 32 cm (13 inches)\nAquic conditions - 148 cm (58 inches)\nEpisaturation -148 cm (58 inches)\nParticle-size control section - 25 to 100 cm (10 to 39 inches)\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory Data # 06PW150001 (Ngedebus.) Additional data are: Nutrient Content of Majuro Soils, Island of Angaur - Sample number: S2, S12; pH: 7.7, 7.3; Organic Matter (%): 2, 6; Nitrogen (%):0.17, 0.89; Phosphorus (ppm): 5, 12; Potassium (ppm):16, 20; Calcium (ppm): 4170, 4156; Magnesium (ppm):184, 180\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 10th edition 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
