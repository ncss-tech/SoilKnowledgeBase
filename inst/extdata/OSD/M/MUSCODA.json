    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 10 inches.(Ap);\nAlbic horizon: the zone from 9 to 16 inches (E);\nArgillic horizon: the zone from 32 to 50 inches (2Bt1,3Bt2);\nLamellic subgroup: lamellae with total thickness of less than 6 inches in the series control section;\nParalithic contact: the contact with glauconitic sandstone at 50 inches (3Cr).\nThe source of the chert, dolostone, and sandstone in the sandy outwash and loamy alluvium is from nearby hills that have been eroded from the river.\nAn Abstract titled, Geology of the Pre-Illinoian Sediment in the Bridgeport Terrace, Lower Wisconsin River Valley, Wisconsin by James C. Knox and John W. Attig explains the sediments found over a rock bench.  It is thought to be a pre-Illinoian sediment with an eastward-sloping depositional surface.  This was laid down when the flow of the Wisconsin River was to the east as a result from an ice blockage along the Mississippi River.\nOnly series status, responsibility, and scrivener's errors changed - 4/09.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
