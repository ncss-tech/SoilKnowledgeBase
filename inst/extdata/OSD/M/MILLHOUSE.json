These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The upper 11 to 18 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.40 grams per cubic centimeter, volcanic glass content of 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron is 0.25 to 0.6 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air-dried samples. The particle-size control section has 20 to 25 percent clay and averages 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Rock fragments range from 55 to 70 percent by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent in the A and AB horizons. Depth to a 2C horizon is between 20 and 40 inches. Depth to the Bt horizon is 11 to 18 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. Texture is ashy loam, gravelly ashy loam, cobbly ashy loam or very cobbly ashy loam[SW1].
