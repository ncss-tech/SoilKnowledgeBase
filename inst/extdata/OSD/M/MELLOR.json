  "OVERVIEW": "The Mellor series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks. Mellor soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, lake plains, flood plains and lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 6 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
