Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent, by volume, throughout the profile.  Cobbles and stones cover from 0 to 15 percent of the surface area.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and gray range from none to common.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, their cobbly or stony analogs.\nThe Bog horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown and gray range from few to many.  Texture is clay loam, clay, their gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe Bo horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red, and gray range from few to many.  Texture is clay loam, clay, their gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe B'og horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to the Bog horizon.\nThe R layer is composed of unweathered hard volcanic sandstone bedrock."

Dwarf soils are on higher positions, are isomesic, very deep, and have a histic epipedon.  Guayabota soils are shallow to bedrock.  The well drained Los Guineos soils are very deep and have less clay in the subsoil.  Palm soils are very deep and have clayey-skeletal control sections.  The moderately well drained Yunque soils are very deep and have less clay in the subsoil."
