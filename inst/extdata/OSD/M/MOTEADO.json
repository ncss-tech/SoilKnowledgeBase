  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Moteado series consists of deep, poorly drained soils on narrow concave ridgetops and side slopes of uplands.  They formed in residuum and colluvium that weathered from andesitic to basaltic, marine deposited volcanic and volcanoclastic sandstone and mudstone of the Hato Puerco, Fajardo, and Tabonuco formations.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 200 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.  Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent.",
