The moderately well drained Cardinal and Geeburg soils are on similar landforms.  Chagrin and Lobdell soils are on adjacent flood plains. Chili and Wheeling soils are on nearby gravelly terraces. Nearby upland soils derived from till include Wooster, Rittman, and Ellsworth soils, and members of their drainage sequences. Oshtemo soils are associated with Mentor soils on valley slopes and outwash plains."

Steeper areas are in woodland or permanent pasture. Original vegetation is deciduous forest. Oak, maple, beech, hickory, tulip tree and ash are the dominant species in wooded areas."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A review of published data during SDJR supports classification of Oxyaquic subgroup for pedons typically less than 12 percent slope and placement in the Typic subgroup for pedons commonly greater than 12 percent. Some areas with slope greater than 18 percent may have a seasonal high water table below 152 cm (6 ft). There are no existing series for these conditions. Due the difference in the soil moisture range across slope phases as published, these areas need to be investigated as a MLRA project across its extent.  These areas may be recorrelated as new series when these areas are updated.\nA gravelly substratum phase is recognized. It may be recorrelated as a new series when its area of use is updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 28 cm (0 to 11 inches) (Ap and BE horizons);\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 28 to 89 cm (11 to 35 in) (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons);\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
