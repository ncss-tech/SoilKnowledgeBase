  "OVERVIEW": "The Madera series consists of moderately deep to hardpan, well or moderately well drained soils that formed in old alluvium derived from granitic rock sources.  Madera soils are on undulating low terraces with slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 65 degrees F and the soil temperature is not below 47 degrees F at any time.  The soil, at depths of about 7 to 24 inches or immediately above the duripan, is dry in all parts from June to November and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2; or 7.5YR 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/4, 3/3 or 7.5YR 4/2.  Moist value or chroma is 4 in some part.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  Has distinct or prominent mottles in some pedons that have been basin irrigated for rice production.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/3 6/3; 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4, 5/2 4/4; or 5YR 6/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3 or 3/3; or 7.5YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/2; 5YR 4/4, 4/3, or 3/4.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 30 percent.\n2Bt horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/3 6/3; 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4, 5/2 4/4; or 5YR 6/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3 or 3/3; or 7.5YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/2; 5YR 4/4, 4/3, or 3/4.  It is clay, sandy clay, or clay loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent.  It has abrupt upper boundary with at least 15 percent clay increase.\nThe duripan has colors similar to those in the Bt horizon and is strongly cemented to indurated with silica, iron and lime.  Silica is the predominant cementing agent with lime segregated in seams.  The duripan grades with depth into less strongly cemented substrata."

Meandering drainageways and closed depressions fill with water to form vernal pools in the winter months.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium mainly from granitic rock sources but may be mixed.  The climate is subhumid with dry hot summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 9 to 18 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; mean July temperature is 80 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 60 to 63 F.  Frost-free period is over 250 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Madera series was formerly classified as fine, montmorillonitic, thermic Typic Durixeralfs but was reclassified because it has an abrupt boundary with an absolute increase of at least 15 percent clay at the upper boundary or within the argillic horizon.  In addition, the range of characteristics was narrowed to avoid overlapping the similar San Joaquin series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 25 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2)\nIndurated iron-silica cemented duripan-  the zone from 25 to 28 inches (Bqkm)"
