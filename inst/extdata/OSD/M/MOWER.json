    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 7 to 12 inches thick.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 12 to 22 inches. Interbedded soft sedimentary bedrock occurs between 20 and 40 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent in the control section averages more than 40 percent, including the carbonates in coarse fragments less than 20 mm diameter. Coarse fragments in the control section range from 10 to 50 percent by volume, but the weighted average is between 20 and 35 percent. The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F. In more than 7 out of 10 years the soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the summer months; but are moist in all parts of the moisture control section about 55 percent of the time soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.; and are moist for 65 to 75 consecutive days during the 120 days after the winter solstice.  The soil moisture regime is typic xeric.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline. Texture of the fine earth is silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, or silt loam. Some profiles have gravel, cobbles or stones in the surface.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine earth is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam, with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, including coarse fragments up to 75 mm. The reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 40 percent by weight.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine earth is silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, or clay loam, with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand, including coarse fragments up to 75 mm. Reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 40 to 50 percent."

Mower soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from shale, sandstone and limestone. The climate is dry sub-humid, with the average annual precipitation typically ranging from 16 to 20 inches; but can be as low as 14 inches in some areas. Mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon:  From 0 to 11 inches. (A1, A2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 35 inches.  (Lower part of A2, Bw, Bk1, and Bk2 horizons)\nCambic Horizon: From 11 to 17 inches. (Bw horizon)\nCalcic Horizon: From 17 to 35 inches. (Bk1, Bk2 horizons)\nThe original description of Mower written in 1971 did not specify if the B2 (Bw) horizon met the requirements for a cambic horizon or not. Because of the presence of soil structure, a color change, and leaching of carbonates to the calcic horizon below, the Bw horizon was deemed a cambic as of this update in 2019.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
