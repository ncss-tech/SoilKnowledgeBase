  "OVERVIEW": "The Mikett series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Mikett soils are on alluvial fans and drainageways.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
