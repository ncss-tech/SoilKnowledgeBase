  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Meldrim soils were previously mapped as a wet phase of the Blanton series. They have sandy layers that extend to a depth of more than 100 centimeters (about 40 inches) and were originally classified as Grossarenic Paleudults; however, they are presently classified as Oxyaquic Paleudults. Plans are underway to revise the Keys to Soil Taxonomy and a re-classification to a subgroup that recognizes the Grossarenic feature is anticipated. Data collected in Effingham County, GA indicate depth to redoximorphic features thought to indicate dominant seasonal wetness range from about 90 to 100 cm with an average depth of 94 cm. However, during the wettest periods of the non-growing season (typically January), Meldrim soils may be saturated for short periods (less than 20 consecutive or 30 cumulative days in a normal year) at a depth of 50 to 75 centimeters.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of 142 centimeters; about 56 inches (A, E, and BE horizons).\nGrossarenic feature--a zone with sandy particle-size class extending from 0 to 142 centimeters; about 0 to 56 inches (A, E, and BE horizons).\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 142 to 203 centimeters; about 56 to 80 inches (Bt and Btg horizons).\nOxyaquic feature--the zone from 94 to 203 centimeters (about 37 to 80 inches) in normal years is saturated for 20 consecutive or 30 cumulative days (E3, BE, Bt, and Btg horizons).\nRedox concentrations--the zone from 56 to 203 centimeters; about 22 to 88 inches (E2, E3, BE, Bt, and Btg horizons)\nRedox depletions with chroma of 2 or less--the zone from 56 to 203 centimeters; about 22 to 80 inches (E3, BE, Bt, and Btg horizons)\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 200 centimeters; about 80 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: No laboratory data available.\nDatabase Information:\nData Mapunit ID--TBD\nUser Pedon ID--07GA103001-Meldrim, OSD\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
