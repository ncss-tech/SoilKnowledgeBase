  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are typically calcareous to the  surface but are leached a few inches in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam with 5 to 18 percent noncarbonate clay and over 45 percent sand of which 35 percent or more is fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are mainly rounded pebbles.  A few cobbles are in some pedons but average less than 5 percent.  Exchangeable sodium is less than 12 percent throughout and typically range from 1 to 5 percent.  EC is less than 2 mmhos in the surface and is less than 4 mmhos in the subsoil and substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The upper part is transitional to the calcic horizon in some pedons.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 30 percent in the calcic horizon but is less in the transitional horizons in some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Elevations are 5,800 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 14 inches with about half falling as snow and less commonly as rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is  estimated to range from 60 to 100 days."
