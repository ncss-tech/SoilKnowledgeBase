  "OVERVIEW": "The Marsden series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in old lakelaid sediments.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 2 to 55 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",
