Particle size control section-- Is the Argillic horizon, 24 to 41 inches (17 inches thick).\n4.  Gypsic horizon--The zone from 24 inches to a depth of 41 inches (Bty horizon).\n5.  Xeric Sub Group--The moisture control section is dry in all parts for less than three-fourths of the time (cumulative). The soil temperature at a depth of 50 centimeters is 5 degrees centigrade or higher and the moisture regime is aridic bordering on a Xeric Regime."
