Milham soils, on fan remnants,do not have a gypsic horizon. Polvadero soils, on fan remnants, have natric and calcic horizons, and do not have a gypsic horizon. Belgarra soils, on erosional fan remnants on mountains, have a fine particle-size control section."

Argillic horizon--The zone from 24 inches to a depth of 41 inches (Bty horizon). This horizon has 34 percent clay and is in a fine-loamy particle size family.\n3.  Particle size control section-- Is the Argillic horizon, 24 to 41 inches (17 inches thick).\n4.  Gypsic horizon--The zone from 24 inches to a depth of 41 inches (Bty horizon).\n5.  Xeric Sub Group--The moisture control section is dry in all parts for less than three-fourths of the time (cumulative). The soil temperature at a depth of 50 centimeters is 5 degrees centigrade or higher and the moisture regime is aridic bordering on a Xeric Regime.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL lab data is available for the Typical Pedon from soil sample number S86CA019-036 (1196-1200). This includes data for selenium content.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
