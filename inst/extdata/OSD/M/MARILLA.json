  "REVDATE": "06/2011",
  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Marilla series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in till. The Marilla soils occupy nearly level to moderately steep land forms of till plains. They have a fragipan that starts at a depth of 15 to 30 inches. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and very slow in the fragipan and underlying till. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 39 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 66 inches. Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 15 to 30 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches in most areas but may range to 40 inches. Coarse fragments, consisting of thin brittle shale, range from 20 to 35 percent in horizons above the fragipan and 20 to 55 percent in the fragipan underlying till and includes 0 to 3 percent fragments greater than 3 inches above the fragipan and 3 to 5 percent in the fragipan and C horizon. Stones greater than 10 inches in diameter cover up to 20 percent of the surface in some areas. Soil reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid above the fragipan and strongly acid to slightly acid in the fragipan and underlying till.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. The Ap horizon has very weak to moderate, very fine to medium granular structure and friable or very friable consistence.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6 with distinct or prominent mottles below depths of 12 to 18 inches. Some pedons have faint redoximorphic features above depths of 12 inches. It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or very weak, very fine through medium granular or subangular blocky structure in the upper part and very weak or weak fine subangular blocky or medium or coarse platy in the lower part. The Bw horizon has firm or friable consistence.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4 and contains redoximorphic features. It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction and is massive or has very coarse prismatic structure.\nSome pedons may have a transitional BC or CB horizon with color and texture similar to the Bx or C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2. It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction and is massive or has plate-like divisions inherited from the large masses of shale in the parent material."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Langford series is the only series in the same family. Langford soils are strongly acid to slightly alkaline or neutral within a depth of 40 inches and have carbonates in the substratum.\nBath, Broadalbin, Cambridge, Canaseraga, Ira, Lackawanna, Mardin, Sodus, Swartswood, Wellsboro, and Wurtsboro are related soils in similar families. Bath, Broadalbin, Canaseraga, Ira, Lackawanna, Mardin, Sodus, Swartswood, Wellsboro, and Wurtsboro all have less than 18 percent clay in the Bw horizon. Cambridge soils have argillic horizons or thick clay films in the fragipan."

The regolith is firm very channery till derived predominantly from brittle, thin-bedded acid shale. Climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches; mean annual air temperature from 46 degrees to 50 degrees F; mean frost-free season from 140 to 190 days."

Allis and Hornell soils are wetter, contain more clay, and have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Derby and Fremont soils are wetter and do not contain fragipans. Lordstown and Manlius soils are better drained and have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Mardin and Volusia contain fewer shale fragments and Volusia is wetter."

    "content": "REMARKS: This pedon lacks dry color information. Since mollic subgroup was a choice at the time of classification it is assumed it did not meet the mollic subgroup criteria. A new TP is needed to resolve this issue.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 7 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 to 20 inches (Bw horizon).\nc. Fragipan - the zone from 20 to 44 inches (Bx horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
