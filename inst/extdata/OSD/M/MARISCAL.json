Intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during June to September. More than 60 percent of the annual rainfall occurs during that period. The soil does not receive significant amounts of moisture during winter months. Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.\nMean annual soil temperature: 22.0 to 25.6 degrees C (72 to 78 degrees F)\nDepth to bedrock: mainly 10 to 30 cm, but ranging up to 50 cm (4 to 12 inches, but ranging up to 20 inches).\nParticle size control section (weighted average):\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: 40 to 70 percent in the fine earth fraction and ranges to 80 percent when less than 20 millimeter fragments are included.\nRock fragments: 35 to 85 percent channers or flagstones.\nThe A, Bk and BCk horizons:\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 5 to 7,\nChroma: 2 to 4.\nTexture of the fine earth fraction: sandy loam, loam or silt loam\nClay content: 10 to 30 percent.\nCalcium carbonate coats on rock fragments: faint discontinuous films to pendants up to 2 inches thick.\nR layer:\nfractured limestone bedrock that contains from 10 to 50 percent interbedded chalky, or marly materials (6 mm to 25 cm (1/4 to 10 inches) thick."

None of these soils is derived from or underlain by flaggy or channery limestone bedrock.\nLangtry soils have mollic epipedons.\nLozier soils are underlain by thick-bedded limestone bedrock, and do not have flags or channers as rock fragments in the control section.\nTerlingua soils are underlain by basalt bedrock and have mixed mineralogy."

Taxonomic class and moisture regime classification changed from typic aridic to ustic aridic.\nClassification change from Lithic Calciorthids to Lithic Torriorthents based on observations that the majority of pedons do not meet thickness requirements for a calcic horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 inches); A horizon\nLithic contact: 25 cm (10 inches); the upper boundary the R layer\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data from TAMU Soil Characterization Laboratory are available from a site in Brewster County, Texas, Main Part, survey area.
