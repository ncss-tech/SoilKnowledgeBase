  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Millstreet soils occur on uplifted marine and river terraces with slopes of 2 to 5 percent.  The soils are formed on alluvium from sedimentary rocks, dominantly sandstone and mudstone. Elevations are 105 to 122 meters.   The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers influenced by a cooling marine layer, and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is from 1140 to 1270 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is 13 to 14 degrees C. Frost-free season is 280 to 300 days."
