    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moroni soils are at elevations of 4,800 to 6,500 feet.  They occur on alluvial fans and colluvial slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Parent materials are alluvium and colluvium from shale, mixed igneous, and quartzite.  The climate is semiarid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F., and the freeze-free period ranges from 100 to 140 days."

Atepic soils are less than 20 inches deep over shale bedrock.  Keigley soils have values of less than 3.5 moist and 5.5 dry in the A1 horizon and are silty clay loam in the particle-size control section.  Freedom soils are silty clay loam in the particle-size control section and have calcic horizons."
