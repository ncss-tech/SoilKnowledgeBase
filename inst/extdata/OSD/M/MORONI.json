  "OVERVIEW": "The Moroni series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from shale.  Moroni soils are on alluvial fans and colluvial slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees.",

Parent materials are alluvium and colluvium from shale, mixed igneous, and quartzite.  The climate is semiarid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F., and the freeze-free period ranges from 100 to 140 days."
