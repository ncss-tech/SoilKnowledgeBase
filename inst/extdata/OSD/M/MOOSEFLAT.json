  "OVERVIEW": "The Mooseflat series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, drainageways, depressions and mountain bases.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
