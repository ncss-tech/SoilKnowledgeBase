    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 30 to more than 60 inches.   Soft powdery secondary carbonates occur mainly below a depth of 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is mainly silty clay loam or silt loam but includes loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have BA horizons that are similar in color and texture to the A horizon.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have BC horizons that are similar in color, texture and reaction to the Bt2 horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons contain strata of coarser textures at depths greater than 50 inches.  Typically the horizon is calcareous but is noncalcareous in some pedons.  Also some pedons have dark colored buried horizons below 50 inches."

Abilene, Brewer, Lofton, and Tabler soils lack upper Bt horizons with hues of 5YR or redder.  In addition, Abilene soils have calcic horizons and Tabler soils have wetness mottles in the Bt horizon.  Bethany and Hollister soils do not decrease in clay content within 60 inches.  Blanket soils have Bt horizons in hues of 10YR or 7.5YR.  Dodson soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods in most years. Lawton and Scullin soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Mingo soils have limestone within a depth of 40 inches.  Rotan soils have a calcic horizon, are dry for longer periods of time, and have an argillic horizon that does not decrease as much as 20 percent from the maximum clay content within a depth of 60 inches.  Wolco soils have limestone at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."
