  "OVERVIEW": "The Murphy series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium derived dominantly from shale.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 4 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F., and average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  The moisture control section is moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months that follow the winter solstice, and are dry for 45 or more consecutive days within the 4 months that follow the summer solstice in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is noncalcareous to strongly calcareous.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam and averages 35 to 39 percent clay.  This horizon ranges from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, cr 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  It commonly is heavy clay loam or clay and less commonly silty clay or silty clay loam.  Clay ranges from 35 to 45 percent."
