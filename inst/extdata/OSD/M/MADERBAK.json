  "OVERVIEW": "The Maderbak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  The Maderbak soils are on summits and side slopes of hills and mountains Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
