    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from igneous rocks such as andesite and welded tuffs.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,680 to 2,140 meters.  The climate is cool, semi-arid with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
