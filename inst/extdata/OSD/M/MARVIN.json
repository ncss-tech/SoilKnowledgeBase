  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 27 to 66 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The soil above 20 inches depth is continuously dry in most years from about May 20 to October 15.  The soils are temporarily saturated in the upper part due to winter rains, or irrigation and slow subsoil permeability.  The exchangeable sodium is less than 15 percent.  The A horizon is light brownish gray, grayish brown, or dark grayish brown dry and very dark grayish brown when moist.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.  The A horizon is mottled.  It contains about 2 to 3 percent organic matter.  It ranges from silty clay loam to silty clay, and from medium acid (pH 6.0) to mildly alkaline.  The soil has an A3 horizon or B1 horizon or both or the boundary between the A horizon and B2 horizon is gradual.  The B2t horizon ranges from grayish brown to dark grayish brown dry and is dark grayish brown when moist.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.  Some pedons have mottles in the B2 horizon.  It is silty clay or clay; and mildly to moderately alkaline.  The B3 horizon is light olive brown, pale brown, or grayish brown dry and dark grayish brown moist.  Hue is 10YR or 2.5Y.   It is mildly to moderately alkaline and slightly to strongly calcareous.  The C horizon is similar to the B3 horizon in color and reaction.  Some areas are affected by salts."

Artois soils have moist color value of 4 or more in the A horizons and yellowish brown Bt horizons.  Lethent soils have natric horizons.  Plaza soils have mottled clay loam Bt horizons.  Rincon soils lack mottles of 2 or lower chroma in all parts.  Zamora soils lack mottles, and have silty clay loam Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marvin soils are on nearly level flood plains at elevations of 10 to 100 feet under annual grasses and forbs.  They formed in fine textured alluvium from mixed sources.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal.  Summer is hot and dry and winter is moist and cool.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 to 62 degrees F., average January temperature is about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 78 degrees F.  The frost-free  season is 250 to 330 days."
