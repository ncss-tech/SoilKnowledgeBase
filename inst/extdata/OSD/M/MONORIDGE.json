Arnold soils (MLRA 15, 20), on hills and uplands, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Briones soils (MLRA 15), on uplands, have slightly acid to strongly acid reaction and do not have effervescence. Calhi soils (MLRA 17), on short rolling dune-like slopes, are deeper than 60 inches and have moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline reaction. Corralitos soils (MLRA 14, 19), on alluvial fans, are deeper than 60 inches have strongly acid to neutral reaction and do not have effervescence. Delhi soils (MLRA 17, 19), on flood plains, alluvial fans and terraces, are deeper than 60 inches and do not have effervescence. Monvero soils (MLRA 15), on dune fields on mountains, are deeper than 60 inches and have slopes less than 30 percent. Tujunga soils (MLRA 14, 17, 18, 19, 29, 30), on alluvial fans and flood plains, are deeper than 60 inches and have slightly acid to slightly alkaline reaction."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly mapped as Rough Broken Land in the unpublished report, Soil Survey of Western Fresno, 1967.  They are being differentiated by being classified and mapped. Consideration should be given to the possibility of requesting that a gypsic subgroup be added to the great group of Xeropsamments in Soil Taxonomy. Monoridge soil does not have a cambic horizon because it does not have texture of very fine sand, loamy fine sand, or finer.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSl lab data pedon sample number S84CA019-001 (1227-1228) for the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
