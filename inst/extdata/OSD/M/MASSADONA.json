  "OVERVIEW": "The Massadona series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Massadona soils are on hills, toeslopes, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
