  "OVERVIEW": "The Mundt series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments.  They  are on canyon sides and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 45 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation  is about 75 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Rock fragments in the control section average 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through  3 moist and dry.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.  Some pedons have lenses of very fine sand.\nThe C horizon has colors, textures and reaction like the B2 horizon, but is massive."
