Rock fragments in the control section average 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 1 through  3 moist and dry.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.  Some pedons have lenses of very fine sand.\nThe C horizon has colors, textures and reaction like the B2 horizon, but is massive."
