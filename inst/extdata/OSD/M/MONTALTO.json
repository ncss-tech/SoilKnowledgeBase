    "content": "REMARKS: This 11/2009 revision updates the type location description and adjusts CEC activity class to semiactive, based on available data of five pedons. Three pedons were semiactive, one subactive and one active. Several pedons had CEC 8.4 data that used to make CEC 7.0 estimates. Competing series section was also revised.\nPrevious revision: 1/2006 WDC\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 14 inches (Ap and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 14 to 46 inches (Bt horizons)\nUltic Hapludalfs subgroup  base saturation (by sum of cations) of more than 35 percent but less than 60 percent  at a depth of 1.25 meters below the top of the argillic horizon\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the NSSL for the following pedons: Soils sampled as S07MD015002 and 86MD510004. Particle size data is also available form the University of Maryland, College Park, MD.\nUsersite ID: 07MD015002 and Userpedon ID: 07MD015002_Montalto\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
