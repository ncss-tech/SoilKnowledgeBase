  "OVERVIEW": "The Meguin series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium of Qaternary age.  These soils are in floodplains of large streams in South Texas. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 885 mm (35 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
