  "OVERVIEW": "The Matanzas series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on foot slopes and small valleys between limestone hills.  They formed in sediments derived from limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 64 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay.\nThe Bo horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 and 4, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is clay."

Coto series are on similar to higher positions, and are very deep and have a base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Tanama soils are on similar to higher positions, have argillic horizons, and are shallow to limestone bedrock."
