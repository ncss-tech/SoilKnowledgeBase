  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The base saturation of the Kandic horizon ranges from 65 to 100 percent and the cation exchange capacity ranges from 7.5 to 10 meg/100 g of clay.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay.\nThe Bo horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 and 4, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Matanzas soils are on foot slopes and small valleys between the limestone hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  They formed in fine-textured sediments derived from limestone.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 68 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 76 to 80 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the competing Cotito series and the Aceitunas, Bayamon, Coto, and Tanama series.  Aceitunas and Bayamon soils are on similar positions and are very deep.  In addition, Aceitunas soils are more acid.  Coto series are on similar to higher positions, and are very deep and have a base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Tanama soils are on similar to higher positions, have argillic horizons, and are shallow to limestone bedrock."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 14 inches (Ap horizon).\nKandic horizon - the zone from 14 to 44 inches (Bo1 and Bo2 horizons).\nLithic contact - the zone at 44 inches (R layer).\nThe classification was updated with the 4/91 draft from Clayey, oxidic, isohyperthermic Tropeptic Eutrorthox to Very-fine, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Lithic Eustrustox.  The previous OSED date was 5/75.  The classification was updated with this draft from Clayey, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Lithic Kandiustox to: Clayey, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Lithic Eutrustox.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The characterization data, published in SSIR No. 12, are for soils no longer considered to be part of the Matanzas Series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
