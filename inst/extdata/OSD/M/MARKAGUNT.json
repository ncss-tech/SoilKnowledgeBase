  "OVERVIEW": "The Markagunt series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and residuum derived from limestone, sandstone, mudstone.  Markagunt soils are on plateaus.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 457 millimeters (18 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
