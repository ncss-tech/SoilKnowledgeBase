Lastone soils average 8 to 18 percent clay in the particle size control section and have a soil temperature of 47 to 52 degrees. Zaqua soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, have a paralithic contact at 14 to 20 inches, and form in weathered volcanic tuff parent material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

Elevations are 4400 to 6500 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. . The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches; mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
