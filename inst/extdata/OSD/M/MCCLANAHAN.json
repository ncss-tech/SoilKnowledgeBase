  "OVERVIEW": "The McClanahan series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from gneiss, schist and altered granitic rocks. McClanahan soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

Elevations are 4400 to 6500 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. . The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches; mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
