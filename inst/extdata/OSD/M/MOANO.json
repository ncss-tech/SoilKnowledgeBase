    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Moano soils are on gently rolling to steep schist hills with slopes ranging from 8 to 60 percent. These soils are formed in place on phyllite or schist bedrock and are at elevations of 4000 to 5500 feet in a semiarid continental climate. The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches and occurs mainly as rain in July, August and September and as rain and some snow in January and February. The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 degrees to 57 degrees F."
