  "REVDATE": "11/2006",
  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Moano series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from phyllite or schist. Moano soils are on gently rolling to steep schist hills. Slopes are 8 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

These soils are formed in place on phyllite or schist bedrock and are at elevations of 4000 to 5500 feet in a semiarid continental climate. The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches and occurs mainly as rain in July, August and September and as rain and some snow in January and February. The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 degrees to 57 degrees F."
