  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  Fine rounded pebbles are absent in the upper part of the solum and range from 0 to 5 percent in the lower part and C horizon.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid where it has not been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6.  Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Where A and E horizon textures are loamy sand, their combined thickness is less than 20 inches.  A thin albic-spodic sequence is present in some uncultivated pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hues of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chromas of 4 through 6.  Texture is sandy loam to clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  The 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It has low and high chroma mottles.  It is clay loam or sandy clay, with some sandy clay laom subhorizons.  Weighted clay content in the Bt averages between 25 and 35 percent with less than 25 percent silt.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 1 through 8.  It is stratified in many pedons and texture ranges from sand to sandy clay or clay loam.  Where not stratified texture ranges from sandy clay loam to clay loam.\nCOMPETING SERIES  The Woodstown soils was the only soil in the same family and it is being changed to mixed mineralogy.  Woodstown soils have A and E horizons that are less than 20 inches in combined thickness."

Slopes are convex to hummocky and range from 0 to 30 percent.  The climate is humid temperate, mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 40 to 48 inches."

Elkton and Fallsington soils are poorly drained.  Evesboro soils are excessively drained and Galestown soils are somewhat excessively drained.  Keyport soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section and Klej soils do not have an argillic horizon and have sandy particle size control section."
