    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Hue of the solum ranges from 5YR through 10YR.  The value and chroma of the A horizon are 2 or 3.  The B horizon ranges from weakly to moderately smeary.  In some pedons the lower part of the B horizon contains pockets that have strong subangular blocky structure.  The B horizon dehydrates irreversibly, and forms dark brown or black, very hard, sand- and silt-size particles."

Manahaa soils have a silt loam control section, are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock and have isomesic temperature.  Niulii soils lack mottles in the lower part of the B horizon, and are 20 to 40 inches deep over bedrock.  Ookala soils have firm consistence and strong subangular blocky structure in the B horizon, and have isohyperthermic temperature.   Paauhau soils are free of mottles in the B horizon, and have isohyperthermic temperature.  Punohu soils are silt loam in the upper part of the B horizon and have isomesic temperature.
