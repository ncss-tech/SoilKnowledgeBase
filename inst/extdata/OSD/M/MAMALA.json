  "OVERVIEW": "The Mamala series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed from alluvium deposited over coral limestone and consolidated calcareous sand. Mamala soils are on coastal plains and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual rainfall is 500 millimeters (20 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C. (76 degrees F.)",
