  "OVERVIEW": "The Miburn series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in tephra deposits on top of alluvium and or eolian material. Miburn soils are on dunes, climbing dunes, and escarpments. Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches (203 millimeters) and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F. (12.8 degrees C.)",
