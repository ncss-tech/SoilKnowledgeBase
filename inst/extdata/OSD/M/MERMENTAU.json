    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline throughout. The electrical conductivity of the saturation extract (dS/m) ranges from 7 to 23.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  A horizons with a color value of 2 or 3 are 4 to 7 inches thick.  Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe Bwg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or it is neutral. Texture is silty clay or clay.\nDominant subhorizons of the 2Cg horizon have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or they are N/4 - N/6.  The 2Cg horizon is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Sand size shell fragments range from none to common.\nThe 3Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or it is neutral.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family.  Alligator, Perry, Sharkey, Solier and Tunica are in similar families.  Alligator, Perry, and Sharkey soils have more than 60 percent clay in the 10-to 40-inch control section and develop cracks to a depth of 20 inches or more in most years.  Solier soils have Bw2 horizons with dominant hue of 5YR and clayey over fine-silty particle-size control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mermentau soils are on low ridges in the Gulf coast marshes at elevations of 2 to 4 feet above sea level.  They are flooded with brackish water during storms and high tides.  They are also flooded with fresh water during heavy rains.  They formed in clayey over loamy sediments.  Slopes range less than 1 percent.  The mean air temperature is 68 degrees F, and the mean annual rainfall is about 53 inches near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Creole, Hackberry, Peveto, and Scatlake series.  Creole soils are on lower positions and have a fine particle-size control section.  Hackberry soils are on higher positions and have a sandy particle-size control section.  Peveto soils are on higher ridges and are sandy throughout.  Scatlake soils have more than 60 percent clay in the 10-to 40-inch control section and have an n-value of more than 1 in all horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Mermentau soils are poorly drained; runoff is negligible; permeability is very slow.  The water level fluctuates between a depth of 0 to 3.5 feet below the surface throughout the year."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Used mainly for rangeland and wildlife habitat.  The vegetation consists dominantly of gulf cordgrass, marshhay cordgrass, seashore saltgrass, and seashore paspalum."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Mermentau soils were formerly included with the Harris series.  The 2 chroma colors in the 2Cg horizon are interpreted to be inherited from a drier moisture regime prior to subsidence.  The exchangeable sodium exceeds 15 percent in the A and Bg horizons.  The exchangeable sodium decreases with depth to 48 inches, then increases.  This pedon fails the criteria for Halaquepts because of the increase.  In this pedon the exchangeable sodium ranges from 10 to 33 percent and the exchangeable magnesium ranges from 27 to 50 percent.  Some data indicate that these soils may marginally classify in a Fluvaquentic subgroup.\nDiagnostic Horizons and Features:\nOchric Epipedon - 0 to 6 inches\nCambic horizon - 6 to 19 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: LSU data from Cameron Parish, LA (S81LA-23-1).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
