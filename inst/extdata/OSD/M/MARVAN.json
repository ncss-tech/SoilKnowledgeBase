  "STATES": "MT,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Marvan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, lacustrine deposits, or in residuum from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, drainageways, sedimentary plains, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
