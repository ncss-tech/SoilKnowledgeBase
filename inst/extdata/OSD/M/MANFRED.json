  "OVERVIEW": "The Manfred series consists of deep, poorly or very poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in till and local alluvium from till.  These soils are on glacial till plains in wet depressions and basins and have slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.",

It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or less.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have Byz or Bkz horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons contain lenses or pockets of other textures with as much as 20 percent gravel."

Barnes and Buse soils are on convex portions of the till plain and do not have an aquic moisture regime.
