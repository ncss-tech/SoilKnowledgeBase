Saline and stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 1 or less.  It is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or less.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have Byz or Bkz horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons contain lenses or pockets of other textures with as much as 20 percent gravel."

Parnell, Tonka, and Vallers soils occupy similar positions as Manfred.  Tonka soils do not have natric horizons.  Barnes and Buse soils are on convex portions of the till plain and do not have an aquic moisture regime.  Hamerly and Svea soils are on smooth and slightly concave positions and do not have natric horizons."
