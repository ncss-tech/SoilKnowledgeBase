  "TYPE LOCATION": {

    "content": "TYPE LOCATION:  Hyde County, North Carolina; approximately 3 miles south of Pungo Lake, 1.7 mile north of SR 1300, 0.6 mile west of Hyde Park Canal and SR 1338.  (100 feet south of Baker Canal at approximate location of Dolman site 8)."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic materials ranges from 16 to 51 inches.  The organic soil material is extremely acid except where the surface has been limed.  The underlying mineral horizons are extremely through strongly acid. Logs, stumps, and fragments of wood occupy 5 to 35 percent of the volume of the organic layers.  Content of charcoal ranges from none to common.  Flakes of mica are few to common in the mineral layers of some pedons. The surface layers are black (N 2/ ; 5YR 2/1; 10YR 2/1) or very dark brown (10YR 2/2).  The lower tiers are centered on dark reddish brown (2.5YR 2/4; 5 YR 2/2, 3/2), dusky red (2.5YR 3/2), or very dusky red (2.5YR 2/2), and range to very dark brown (10YR 2/2), very dark gray (5YR 3/1), and black (5YR 2/1; 10YR 2/1). Fiber content ranges from 20 percent to 45 percent unrubbed and is less than 10 percent after rubbing.  Ten (10) inches or more of the subsurface tier is in hue of 5YR or 2.5YR.  The organic material of this layer is paste-like, has greasy feel (colloidal), and is massive under natural wet conditions.  Upon aeration, as with drainage, the organic material develops a weak subangular blocky structure.  Air drying causes shrinkage and development of hard subangular blocky fragments that dry irreversibly. The underlying mineral layers are stratified loamy sand, fine sand, or sand in the upper portion and may be loamy in the lower part.  The IIAb horizon is not present in some pedons.  Mineral horizons are variable in color and range from very dark brown through brownish yellow."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Allemands, Belhaven, Dare, Delcomb, Dorovan, Lafitte, Maurepas, Okeechobee, Pamlico, Ponzer, Pungo, Terra Ceia, and Tomoka. Allemands soils are euic and are underlain by clayey sediments. Belhaven, Delcomb, Ponzer, and Tomoka soils have organic layers underlain by loamy textured mineral horizons at less than 51 inches.  Dare, Dorovan, Lafitte, Maurepas, and Pungo soils have more than 51 inches of organic materials over mineral horizons. In addition, Lafitte and Maurepas soils are euic.  Pamlico soils have no colloidal layer and all organic layers are in hues of 10YR and 7.5YR.  Terra Ceia and Okeechobee are euic and have temperature regimes that are hyperthermic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mattamuskeet soils are on nearly level to level areas of the Lower Coastal Plains.  The soils formed under very poorly drained or saturated conditions from the remains of swampy vegetation dominated by tupelo, cypress, Atlantic white-cedar and related nonwoody, fiberous hydrophytic plants over sandy marine and fluvial sediments.  Elevation near the type location is 11.5 feet above mean sea level.  The mean precipitation is about 51 inches near the type location.  The growing season is about 190 days."

All of these are mineral soils.  Ballahack, Cape Fear, Hyde, Portsmouth, and Weeksville soils have umbric epipedons, and Wasda soils have histic epipedons.  Barclay and Pasquotank soils have better drainage and are located on the high parts of the landscape."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of the acreage is undeveloped and supports plant communities that reflect past history of treatment. Some areas are vegetated with scattered pond pine (Pinus serotina) and a dense undergrowth of both large and small gall berry (Ilex spp.) and huckleberry (Gaylvssacia spp.), greenbrier (Smilex spp.), wax myrtle (Myrica cerifera), scattered red maple (Acer rubrum), red bay (Persea borbonia), sweet bay (Magnolia virginia), and reeds (Arundinaria tecta).  Areas with a history of severe burning usually have a smaller population of these species and contain large amounts of broomsedge (Andropogon spp.) and other grasses.  These soils also support mixed hardwood forests dominated by water and swamp tupelo (Nyssa spp.), southern bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), Atlantic white-cedar (Chamaecyparis thyodies (L.) B.S.P.), and other hydrophytic species.  Developed areas are used primarily for growing corn, soybeans, small grain, and pasture."
