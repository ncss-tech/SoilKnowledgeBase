The somewhat poorly drained Bennington and Ravenna soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained Condit soils have more clay in the subsoil and are on similar landscape positions. The very poorly drained Luray and Patton soils and the poorly drained Sebring soils formed in silty lacustrine materials on lake plains."
