Faxon and Mound Creek soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Kossuth soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper part of the series control section. Letri soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Reddick soils have less than 35 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Selma and Selmass soils have more than 50 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Tripoli soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Webster soils are in cooler and drier climates, have friable till C horizons, and typically have thinner sola."

The somewhat poorly drained Bennington and Ravenna soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained Condit soils have more clay in the subsoil and are on similar landscape positions. The very poorly drained Luray and Patton soils and the poorly drained Sebring soils formed in silty lacustrine materials on lake plains."
