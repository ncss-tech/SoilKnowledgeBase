  "OVERVIEW": "The Misteguay series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on flood plains that occur on lake plains. They formed in clayey alluvium over clayey glaciolacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
