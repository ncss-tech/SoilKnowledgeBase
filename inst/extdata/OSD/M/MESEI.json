The water table was 10 inches above the soil surface. (Colors are for moist soil. Texture for C horizon is apparent field texture.)\nOa1--0 to 13 centimeters (0 to 5 inches); dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) muck; about 30 percent fiber, 2 percent rubbed; massive; nonsticky and slightly plastic; many very fine and fine roots and medium roots; color is 10YR 7/2 in pyrophosphate solution; very strongly acid (pH 4.5 in calcium chloride); clear smooth boundary.

The difference between the mean summer and winter temperatures is less than 6 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) is 3048 to 3683 millimeters (120 to 145 inches). Thickness of the organic layers above a mineral layer ranges from 63 to 99 centimeters (25 to 39 inches). The water table ranges from 30 centimeters (12 inches) above the surface to 15 centimeters (6 inches) below the surface. Rubbed fiber content throughout the surface and subsurface tiers ranges from 0 to 20 percent by volume. Some pedons have strata that are as much as 15 percent by volume mineral silt and clay. The surface layer is hemic or sapric material.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Reaction in calcium chloride is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe 2C horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam. It has hue of 10YR, 2.5YR, or 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. It is from 0 to 10 percent by volume coarse fragments. Reaction in 1:1 water is medium acid or slightly acid. The N value is more than 0.7."
