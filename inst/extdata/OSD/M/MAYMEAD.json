This soil is placed in the semiactive CEC activity class based on comparison with associated soils such as Ditney. 11/13 revision verifies classification--11th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy changes format to semitab, and minor changes to Range in Characteristics.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 10 to 38 cm, 4 to 15 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nb. Cambic horizon--the zone from 38 to 167cm, 15 to 66 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nc. Lithic contact--the contact with unweathered rock at 167 cm, 66 inches (upper boundary of the R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSoil Characterization Data is available from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL) website: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
