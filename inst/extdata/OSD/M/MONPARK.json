Monpark soils are on sideslopes of hills and alluvial fans on valley sides. Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 6000 to 7000 feet. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. The frost free period is 120 to 140 days."

Rizno and Tekapo soils are shallow to sandstone and shale respectively. The Aquima soils have a cambic horizon and have a fine-loamy control section. The Flugle, Fragua, and Hawaikuh soils have argillic horizons. Venadito and Ojocal soils are very deep."
