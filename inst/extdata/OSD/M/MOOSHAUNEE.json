  "OVERVIEW": "The Mooshaunee series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered mainly from siltstone, mudstone, and fine-grained sandstone in the Triassic Basins of the Southern Piedmont.  Permeability is moderate and moderately slow.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 61.5 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 47.6 inches near the type location.",

Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid unless surface layers have been limed.  The content of coarse fragments 1/4 to 10 inches in size comprises from 0 to 5 percent of the A and Bt horizons.  Some pedons have up to 5 percent iron and manganese concretions.\nThe A or Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7, chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of gray are in some part of the Bt horizon of all pedons, and iron depletions in shades of brown or yellow are in the Bt horizon of most pedons.  Most pedons also have masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown or red in some part of the Bt horizon.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of gray, brown, or yellow are few to common, as well as masses of iron accumulation in shades of red or brown.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8 with iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown, and iron accumulations in shades of red or brown.   Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.
