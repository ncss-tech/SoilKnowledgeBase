  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to paralithic contact with soft, weathered bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid unless surface layers have been limed.  The content of coarse fragments 1/4 to 10 inches in size comprises from 0 to 5 percent of the A and Bt horizons.  Some pedons have up to 5 percent iron and manganese concretions.\nThe A or Ap horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7, chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of gray are in some part of the Bt horizon of all pedons, and iron depletions in shades of brown or yellow are in the Bt horizon of most pedons.  Most pedons also have masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown or red in some part of the Bt horizon.  Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Iron depletions in shades of gray, brown, or yellow are few to common, as well as masses of iron accumulation in shades of red or brown.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8 with iron depletions in shades of gray, yellow, or brown, and iron accumulations in shades of red or brown.   Texture is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is weathered Triassic siltstone, mudstone, or fine-grained sandstone that is partially consolidated but can be dug with difficulty with a spade."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Margo and Yeopim series in the same family, and the Brickhaven, Carbonton, and Hallison series in a closely related family.  Margo and Yeopim soils do not have a Cr horizon.  Brickhaven and Carbonton soils are fine, mixed, semiactive, thermic Oxyaquic Hapludalfs.  In addition, Brickhaven soils have a Cr horizon at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Hallison soils are Typic Hapludults, and in addition have a Cr horizon at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mooshaunee soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep ridges and side slopes in Triassic Basins of the Southern Piedmont.  Slopes are generally 2 to 15 percent but range up to 25 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from Triassic siltstones, mudstones, and sandstones.  Mean annual precipitation is 47.6 inches and mean annual air temperature is 61.5 degrees F. near the type location."

Mayodan and Creedmoor soils are clayey and lack a Cr horizon.  Pinkston soils contain less clay and are underlain with hard bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  White Store soils are clayey and have a Cr horizon at depths greater than 48 inches.  Polkton soils are clayey.  Granville soils lack a Cr horizon, have lower silt content, and siliceous mineralogy."
