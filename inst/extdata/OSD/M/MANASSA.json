  "STATES": "ID,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Manassa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary rocks.  Manassa soils are on fan remnants, flood plains, lake plains, and lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The soils are dry in the moisture control section for 51 to 55 percent of the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is Aridic bordering on Xeric.\nThese soils are saline-alkali and range from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline. The sodium adsorption ratio is 13 or higher throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 20 percent.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from silty clay to fine sandy loam, but the particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Below a depth of 40 inches textures range from fine sandy loam to silty clay.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent."
