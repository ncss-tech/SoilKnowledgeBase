  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  The soils are dry in the moisture control section for 51 to 55 percent of the time the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  The soil moisture regime is Aridic bordering on Xeric.\nThese soils are saline-alkali and range from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline. The sodium adsorption ratio is 13 or higher throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 20 percent.  Clay content is 18 to 27 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from silty clay to fine sandy loam, but the particle-size control section averages 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Below a depth of 40 inches textures range from fine sandy loam to silty clay.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent."

They formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments from shale, sandstone and limestone.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Elevations range from 4,250 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature ranges from 65 to 69 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 180 days."
