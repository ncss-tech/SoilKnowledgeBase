  "OVERVIEW": "The McMullin series consists of shallow, well and somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from shale, sandstone, basic igneous and metamorphic rocks.  McMullin soils are on ridges and south-facing slopes in Oregon and on north-facing slopes in California.  Slopes are 1 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years, the soil between a depth of 4 inches and the lithic contact is usually continually moist from October or early November until May or June and is usually dry all the rest of the year.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 59 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  The percentage of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the solum.  The mollic epipedon is at least 7 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is sandy loam or loam.  It is slightly or moderately acid, and has 50 to 75 percent base saturation.  In some pedons, it directly overlies bedrock.  It has 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam and has 20 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and cobbles."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations are 400 to 4,400 feet in Oregon and down to 50 feet in California.  The soils formed in material weathered from shale, sandstone, basic igneous and metamorphic rocks.  The climate is subhumid, temperate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F, the mean January temperature is 34 to 40 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 235 days in Oregon and up to 330 days in California."

Reliz soils are on warmer slopes and have a mean annual soil temperature of more than 59 degrees F."
