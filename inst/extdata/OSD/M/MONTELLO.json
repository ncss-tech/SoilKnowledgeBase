    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon -  0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 inches) (Ap, A); argillic horizon -  31 to 64 cm (12 to 25 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3).\n- The location for the typical pedon site in this OSD does not match the location given for the same pedon (TUD) in the published survey. Both descriptions say the site is 50 feet west of the road. The location given in this OSD is 250 to 300 feet east of the road. The original location given in the TUD says NW1/4 NW1/4 sec. 28, T. 15 N., R. 8 E.; 50 feet west of Town Road A and 3/5 mile south of the intersection of Town Roads A and D. There is no Montello mapped in this 40 acres and it is more than 50 feet west of Town Road A. However, if this location is changed to NE1/4, NW1/4 sec. 28, T. 15 N., R. 8 E.; 50 feet west of Town Road A and 3/5 mile south of the intersection of Town Roads A and D, the site falls in a map unit of MsA, Montello silt loam, 0 to 2 percent slopes. This location has been used.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
