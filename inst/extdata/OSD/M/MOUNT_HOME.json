    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 61 to 64 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 16 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of genetically concentrated visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  The control section is usually very cobbly sandy loam with clay ranging 5 to 18 percent in the fine earth fraction and more than 35 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and range in size from 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter, but are dominantly larger than 3 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and has 2 to about 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction."
