  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 61 to 64 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 0 to 16 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of genetically concentrated visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  The control section is usually very cobbly sandy loam with clay ranging 5 to 18 percent in the fine earth fraction and more than 35 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent and range in size from 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter, but are dominantly larger than 3 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline and has 2 to about 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the fine earth fraction."

The soils formed in veru cobbly and gravelly alluvium from mixed rock.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 62 degrees F."
