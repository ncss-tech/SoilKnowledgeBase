  "OVERVIEW": "The Medco series consists of moderately deep, moderately well\ndrained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from tuffs, breccias, and andesite.  Medco soils are on hillslopes and have slopes of 1 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is\nabout 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49\ndegrees F.",

The\nmean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Few faint mottles are in\nthe solum, in some pedons, above the 2B horizon.  The\nparticle-size control section averages 50 to 60 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist\nand 4 or 5 dry.  Typically it is 10 to 15 inches thick.  It is\nclay loam, or stony or cobbly clay loam with 0 to 15 percent\ngravel; 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent stones.\nCommonly there is a stone line at the lower boundary of this\nhorizon.\nThe 2B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5\nmoist and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 2 or 3 dry.\nIt is clay or cobbly clay and averages 5 to 30 percent rock\nfragments of which 5 to 15 percent are gravel and 0 to 15 percent\nare cobbles.  It is moderately or strongly acid but may range to slightly acid."
