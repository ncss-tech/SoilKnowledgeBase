    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are\ndry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 80 to 110 consecutive\ndays in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The\nmean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Few faint mottles are in\nthe solum, in some pedons, above the 2B horizon.  The\nparticle-size control section averages 50 to 60 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist\nand 4 or 5 dry.  Typically it is 10 to 15 inches thick.  It is\nclay loam, or stony or cobbly clay loam with 0 to 15 percent\ngravel; 0 to 20 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent stones.\nCommonly there is a stone line at the lower boundary of this\nhorizon.\nThe 2B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5\nmoist and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 2 or 3 dry.\nIt is clay or cobbly clay and averages 5 to 30 percent rock\nfragments of which 5 to 15 percent are gravel and 0 to 15 percent\nare cobbles.  It is moderately or strongly acid but may range to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Medco series consists of moderately\ndeep, moderately well drained soils on hillslopes.  These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from tuffs, breccias, and andesite.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Elevation is 1,500 to 4,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation\nis 20 to 40 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 45 to\n52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

McMullin soils\nare shallow, well drained, and have loamy textures.  McNull soils\nare well drained, have less than 50 percent clay in the control section, and have a hue of 5YR."
