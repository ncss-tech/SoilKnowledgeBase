  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThickness of the solum is 40 to 60\ninches and depth to bedrock is 5 to 10 feet or more.  The soil contains less than 15 percent coarse fragments, plus sand coarser than very fine sand in the solum.  The reaction is very strongly\nacid to strongly acid in all horizons except in surface layers\nwhere lime has been added.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe matrix of the B horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 10YR, or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray or brown and the depth to mottles with chroma of 2 or less ranges from 8 to 24 inches.  It is silt loam or light silty clay loam, and has weak to moderate subangular blocky structure.\nThe matrix of the C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray or brown and some pedons are mottled without a dominant matrix color.  It is silt loam, loam, or light silty clay loam and is stratified in some pedons."

Morehead\nsoils formed in silty acid alluvium more than 5 feet thick, washed from silty soils of uplands formed in acid shale and siltstone.  Near the type location, the average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F."
