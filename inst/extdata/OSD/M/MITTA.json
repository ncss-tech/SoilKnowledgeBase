These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Depth to the irrigation-induced water table ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 25 to 45 inches thick. The upper 25 to 40 inches of the particle-size control section has an estimated bulk density of 1.00 to 1.30 grams per cubic centimeter, phosphate retention is 20 to 25 percent, volcanic glass content of 30 to 45 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid oxalate iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent and 15-bar water retention of 15 to 20 percent for air dried samples. It averages 19 to 25 percent clay by field texture. The lower part of the control section has volcanic glass content of 5 to 15 percent and averages 25 to 30 percent clay in the fine earth fraction. Organic matter is estimated to range from 3 to 5 percent in the Ap horizon.\nAp and A1 horizons have value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist. Reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline. Sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) ranges from 1 to 10.\nThe A2 and AB horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist. Texture is ashy silt loam or ashy loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2BA horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2, dry or moist. Texture is clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. Texture is clay loam, loam, or silty clay loam. It has 5 to 10 percent gravel."
