Bon, Humbarger, Maskell, Merrick, Shanta, St. Onge and Umbarg soils do not have Bw horizons and are calcareous throughout.  Pack soils do not have Bw horizons and have redoximorphic features within the 10- to 40- inch particle-size control section.  Frazwell soils have buried horizon and do not contain segregated calcium carbonate.  Lynx soils do not have Bw horizons and are typically noncalcareous throughout the particle-size control section.  Maskell and Merrick soils are noncalcareous within 40 inch depths. Mauricanyon soils are more moist in May and June."

Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from sedimentary rocks.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 14 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 100 to 180 days and elevation ranges from 4,700 to 8,000 feet.  Precipitation range as low as 10 inches in Arizona."
