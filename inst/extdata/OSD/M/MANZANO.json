  "OVERVIEW": "The Manzano series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from limestone, shale, and sandstone.  Manzano soils are along drainageways, on valley floors, valley sides, stream terraces and the lower parts of the alluvial fans.  Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Bon, Humbarger, Maskell, Merrick, Shanta, St. Onge and Umbarg soils do not have Bw horizons and are calcareous throughout.  Pack soils do not have Bw horizons and have redoximorphic features within the 10- to 40- inch particle-size control section.  Frazwell soils have buried horizon and do not contain segregated calcium carbonate.  Lynx soils do not have Bw horizons and are typically noncalcareous throughout the particle-size control section.  Maskell and Merrick soils are noncalcareous within 40 inch depths. Mauricanyon soils are more moist in May and June."
