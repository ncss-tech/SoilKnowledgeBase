  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 70 inches.  The A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is mainly silty clay loam but ranges to clay loam and silt loam.  This horizon is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic concentrations are distinct or prominent and are light yellowish brown, yellowish brown, strong brown, or reddish brown.  Some pedons have faint gray or light gray redoximorphic concentrations.  The Btg horizon is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay; clay content is 35 to 50 percent and sand content is less than 30 percent.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4 with redoximorphic concentrations in shades of brown, red, or brown.  It is similar to the Btg horizon in texture.  It ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a C layer with color, texture, and reaction similar to the BCg horizon."
