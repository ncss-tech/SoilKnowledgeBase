  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Morical soils are on ridgetops, mountain slopes, and foothills. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. They formed in residuum and colluvium mixed with volcanic ash and loess in the surface overlying weathered granite or quartzite lithology. Elevation is 2,000 to 3,200 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 100 to 140 days."
