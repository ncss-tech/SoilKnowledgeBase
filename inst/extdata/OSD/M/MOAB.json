Elevations range from 4,600 to 5,400 feet.  Mean annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  Precipitation during the growing season occurs in March and early April and again July through October. Late April, May and June are usually very dry.  The freeze-free period is about 140 to 160 days."
