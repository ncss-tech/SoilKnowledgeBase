  "OVERVIEW": "The Moab series consists of very deep, well drained moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived mostly from intermediate igneous rocks and sandstone.  Moab soils are on dissected alluvial fans, alluvial terraces, and alluvial valley floors and have slopes of 2 to 30 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
