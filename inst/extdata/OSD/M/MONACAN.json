Chewacla, Mooreville, and Riverview soils have a base saturation of less\nthan 60 percent.  Congaree, Hannahatchee, and Tuckahoe soils do\nnot have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the surface.  Hamben and Marietta soils are in a siliceous family.\nKemp soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Lobdell and Weaver soils are in a mesic family.  Thenas soils are in a corase-loamy family.  soils are in a coarse-loamy family."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Monacan soils formed in recent alluvium in nearly level flood plains in the Piedmont and upper Coastal Plain.  Slopes are commonly less than 2 percent.  The loamy sediments are largely derived from soils formed in residuum from schist, gneiss, granite, phyllite, and other metamorphic and igneous rocks.  The\nmean annual temperature ranges from about 61 to 66 degrees F and\nthe mean annual precipitation ranges from about 39 to 45 inches."
