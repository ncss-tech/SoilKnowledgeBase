  "STATES": "NC,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Monacan series are deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained with moderate permeability.  They formed in recent alluvial sediments of the Piedmont and Coastal Plain.  Slopes are commonly less than 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
