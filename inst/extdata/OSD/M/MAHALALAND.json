  "OVERVIEW": "The Mahalaland series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that are deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mahalaland soils formed in loess or other silty material and the underlying loamy outwash. They are on outwash plains and outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.6 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part of the solum and high in the lower part, and high or very high in the underlying material.

Transects indicate that these soils should be separated from the Westland and Mahalasville soils based on the thickness of the silty material and the underlying gravelly outwash.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, A horizons).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 117 cm (Btg, 2Btg horizons.\nAquic conditions: redoximorphic features in all horizons below the mollic epipedon.\nRepresentative NASIS data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 153351 in MO 11."
