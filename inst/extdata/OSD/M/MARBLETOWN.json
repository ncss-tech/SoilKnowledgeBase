Depth to a paralithic contact in sandstone or shale ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The control section ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  The particle size control section averages between 24 and 35 percent clay.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap, A, and/or AB horizons) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Bt and/or BA horizon) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe lower part of the series control section has properties as follows: the 2Bt or 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 20 percent.\nThe 3Cr horizon is weathered sandstone or shale bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marbletown soils are on foot slopes of loess-covered bluffs and on strath terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of silty alluvium, commonly of local origin and the underlying loamy deposits.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches."
