  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mal series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils on foothills and mountain slopes at elevations of 1,500 to 2,400 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  Mal soils formed in tuffaceous marine siltstone and basaltic sandstone with an admixture of volcanic ash. Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is about 65 inches.",
