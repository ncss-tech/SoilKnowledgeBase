The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A and BA horizons have hue of 10 YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 2 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist or dry.  It is heavy clay loam, heavy silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Clay films are thin to thick and nearly continuous on faces of peds and in pores.\nThe C horizon is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.
