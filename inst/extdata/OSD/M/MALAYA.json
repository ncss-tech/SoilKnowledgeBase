  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to highly fractured unconsolidated rock ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the Ap horizon and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the Bw horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Content of pebbles ranges from 10 to 25 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam, clay or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Content of pebbles range from 10 to 25 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam, clay, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Content of parapebbles range from 10 to 35 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or their or their gravelly and very gravelly analogs.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of semi-consolidated calcareous tuffaceous rock.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment."

They formed in residuum that weathered from calcareous semi-consolidated tuffaceous rock.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 44 to 58 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 74 to 78 degrees F."
