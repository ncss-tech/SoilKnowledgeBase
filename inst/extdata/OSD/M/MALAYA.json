  "OVERVIEW": "The Malaya series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on summits, shoulders, and back slopes of mountains of the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in colluvium and residuum that weathered from calcareous semi-consolidated tuffaceous rock.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 76 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches.  Slopes range from 20 to 60 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to highly fractured unconsolidated rock ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the Ap horizon and from neutral to moderately alkaline in the Bw horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Content of pebbles ranges from 10 to 25 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam, clay or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Content of pebbles range from 10 to 25 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam, clay, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Content of parapebbles range from 10 to 35 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or their or their gravelly and very gravelly analogs.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of semi-consolidated calcareous tuffaceous rock.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment."
