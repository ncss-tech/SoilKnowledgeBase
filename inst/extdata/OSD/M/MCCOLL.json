The soil is extremely acid to moderately acid throughout, except in limed areas. Nodules of plinthite totaling less than 5 percent by volume are in some pedons. Some pedons have few to common concretions of ironstone.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Btg or B'tg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 or it is neutral with vale of 4 to 7. Many pedons have masses of iron accumulation in shades of red, yellow, or brown. It is sandy clay loam in the upper part, or it is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay. The lower boundary of most pedons is clear irregular or abrupt irregular with tongues of the Bt horizon that taper with depth and extend into the Btx horizon.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Red masses of iron accumulation, or gray iron depletions are in most pedons. This horizon has moderate to strong coarse prismatic structure parting to platy or blocky.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other known series in this family. Similar series in other families are Argent, Coxville, Gourdin, Rains, Ogeechee, Rembert, Wadmalaw, Williman, and Yemassee. None of these soils except Gourdin exhibits episaturation. Gourdin soils are fine-loamy. In addition, Argent soils have mixed clay mineralogy. Coxville and Rains soils do not have a 20 percent clay decrease within 60 inches of the surface. Wadmalaw soils have an umbric epipedon. Williman soils have an arenic epipedon. Ogeechee and Yemassee soils are fine-loamy."
