  "OVERVIEW": "The McColl series consists of poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that are shallow or moderately deep to a fragipan and very deep to bedrock. They formed in loamy sediments in oval depressions on the Coastal Plain. The soils are nearly level or concave. Runoff is ponded. Slopes are less than 2 percent.",
