(A, Bw1, Bw2 horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with granodiorite at 61 cm.  (Cr layer)\nThe mineralogy is estimated to be mixed rather than micaeous; this has not been verified with lab data.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 11th Edition, 2010.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nThis pedon was sampled for NSSL; soil survey sample number S92-CO-093-001.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
