  "OVERVIEW": "The Martland series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from granodiorite, gneiss, and/or schist.  Martland soils are on pediments.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 331 mm (13 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).",
