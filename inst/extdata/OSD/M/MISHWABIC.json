  "BYREV": "Rev. JSE-LMC-JJJ",
  "REVDATE": "04/2009",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mishwabic series consists of moderately deep, poorly drained soils on till plains and post glacial lake shorelines. They formed in loamy material overlying sedimentary bedrock. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the paralithic material. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
