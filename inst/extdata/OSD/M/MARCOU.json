Apron soils have hue of 2.5Y or yellower in the C horizon. Fang, Geer, Kumiva and Piltdown soils have volcanic ash, glass, or other pyroclastic material in the control section. Fruitland and Jeddito soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower. In addition, Jeddito soils have contrasting stratification in the control section. Jenrid and Shotnick soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 51 degrees F. and also have precipitation distributed evenly throughout the year and are more moist in May and June. Trachute soils have gypsum in the control section. Ganaflan, Mazuma, Piltdown and Tooele soils are dry in the soil moisture control section from May through November. Moepitz, Vanderhoff, Wentridge and Worland soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Sodaspring soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section."

These soils formed in eolian deposits over stream and fan alluvium derived from mudstone, sandstone, and shale. Slopes range from  0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 53 to 57 degrees F. The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."
