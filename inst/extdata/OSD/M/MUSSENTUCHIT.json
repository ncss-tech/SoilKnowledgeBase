No update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nIn August 2007 classification was changed to Leptic Haplogypsids from Typic Calcigypsids with Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition 2006.  Horizon nomenclature and competing section was updated.\nLab data for the particle size class is fine-gypseous (48 percent for the fine sand and coarser fraction).\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Key to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
