  "OVERVIEW": "The Mussentuchit series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in eolian deposits and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived mainly from gypsiferous sandstone and shale. Mussentuchit soils are on cuestas, hills and structural benches and have slopes of 3 to 35 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

No update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nIn August 2007 classification was changed to Leptic Haplogypsids from Typic Calcigypsids with Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition 2006.  Horizon nomenclature and competing section was updated.\nLab data for the particle size class is fine-gypseous (48 percent for the fine sand and coarser fraction).\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Key to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
