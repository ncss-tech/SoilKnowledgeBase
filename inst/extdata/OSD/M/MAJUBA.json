  "OVERVIEW": "The Majuba series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from phyllite, slate and schist. The Majuba soils are on mountain side slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
