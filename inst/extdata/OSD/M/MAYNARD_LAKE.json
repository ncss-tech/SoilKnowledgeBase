Contains more than 20 percent volcanic ash and pumice. Gravel content rarely exceeds 30 percent in the control section but may range up to 70 percent in thin strata below 40 inches.\nCarbonates show slightly to violently effervescent to 10 percent HCl.\nA and C horizons - Hue: 10YR to 7.5YR\nValue: 5 to 6.5 dry and 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 2 through 4."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bluepoint(NV), Brazito(NM), Cajon(CA), Pintura(UT), Toquop(NV) and Yturbide(NM) series.  All of these soils differ mainly in having less than 20 percent volcanic ash, glass, or other pyroclastic materials in their silt or coarser fraction.  In addition Brazito soils have uncoated sand particles and are predominantly sand or fine sand in the control section; Cajon soils have been derived from granitic sources; Pintura soils have hues of 2.5YR; and Toquop soils have predominantly fine sand control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Maynard Lake soils occur on smooth, slightly undulating or slightly convex nearly level to strongly sloping alluvial fans and flood plains with slope gradients of O to 15 percent. In some areas erosion has cut deep channels through these soils. They have developed in sandy alluvium derived mainly from ignimbrite but partly from dolomite, limestone, quartzite, and basalt. These soils occur at elevations of 3,000 to 3,500 feet where the mean annual precipitation is between 6 and 7 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 57 to 60 degrees F., and the frost-free period is about 170 to 200 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Carrizo and Seaman. Carrizo soils have more than 50 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Seaman soils have fine sandy loam control sections."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Where water is available for irrigation the soils are used largely for alfalfa and small grain production. Most areas, however, have no irrigation water and are used for livestock grazing.  Plant density is about 5 percent and consists mainly of creosotebush, white bursage, shadscale, white burrobrush, and galleta."
