  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 80 or more inches thick.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons, and very strongly acid to medium acid in the Bt, Btg and BCg horizons.  A few ironstone and leached phosphatic limestone nodules about 1 to 15 mm in size occur in many pedons but are less than 5 percent by volume.  Some pedons have up to 2 percent cobbles in the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where value is 3, thickness is 4 to 6 inches.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8 in the upper part.  The lower part of the E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Mottles of brown and yellow range from none to common.  Small pockets and streaks of light gray or white uncoated sand grains occur throughout in some pedons.  Gray and red or strong brown mottles indicative of wetness occur below a depth of 40 inches.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe EB horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 6, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.  It is less than 8 inches thick.\nThe Bt horizon where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 7, with or without gray, yellow, red and brown mottles.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 2, with mottles in shades of red, gray, yellow, and brown, or it is a mixture of these colors.  It is usually at depths of more than 55 inches.  Texture of the Btg horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nWhere present, the BCg horizon has hue of 10YR to N, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 2 or less.  It is generally in various shades of gray, yellow, and brown.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Millhopper soils are on upland areas of central and southern Florida.  Dominant slope gradients range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Average annual precipitation is about 50 to 55 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 70 to 74 degrees F."

Blichton soils contain over 5 percent plinthite, have loamy soil within a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are poorly drained.  Fort Meade soils have an umbric epipedon, are well drained, and are sandy to depths of more than 80 inches.  Gainesville soils are well drained and are sandy to more than 80 inches.  Kanapaha soils are poorly drained.  Kendrick soils are well drained and have loamy soil within a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Lochloosa soils are somewhat poorly drained and have loamy soil within a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Tavares soils are sandy throughout."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; slow runoff.  Permeability is rapid in the A and E horizons and slow to moderate in the Bt horizons.  The water table is at a depth of 48 to 60 inches for 1 to 4 months and at 60 to 72 inches for 2 to 4 months during most years.  It may be at 30 to 48 inches for cumulative periods of 1 to 3 weeks during some years."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas are cleared and used for improved pasture or for cultivated crops.  Native vegetation consists of live oak, laurel oak, post oak, water oak, sweetgum, cherry laurel, few hickory, and slash and longleaf pine.  The understory is chiefly lopsided indiangrass, hairy panicum, low panicum, greenbrier, hawthorne, persimmon, fringeleaf paspalum, chalky and creeping bluestems, and pineland threeawn."
