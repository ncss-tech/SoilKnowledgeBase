  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family. The Chazy (T), Cowhorn, and Peasleeville (T) series were in the same family, but have not been classified for CEC activity class. Chazy (T) soils have sandstone bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Cowhorn soils have loamy very fine sand and very fine sand textures dominating the solum. Peasleeville (T) soils formed in glacial till and have more rock fragments in the subsoil and substratum.\nBrayton, Ensley, Malone, Hailesboro, Minoa, and Swanton series are in similar families. Brayton soils are formed in glacial till and have a Cd horizon. Ensley and Malone soils formed in glacial till and have carbonates within 60 inches of the surface. Malone soils have more rock fragments in the solum. Hailesboro soils are fine silty. Minoa soils are mesic. Swanton soils are coarse-loamy over clayey."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mino soils are on lake or marine plains that have a concave surface. Slopes commonly are 0 to 3 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent. The soils formed in loamy materials deposited in a near-shore environment. The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches.  The growing season ranges from 120 to 150 days."

Croghan and Deford soils are sandy, and Croghan soils are higher on the landscape than Mino soils, and Deford soils are on slightly lower landscape positions. Elmwood, Swanton and Munuscong soils are coarse-loamy over clayey. In addition, Elmwood soils occupy higher more convex topographic positions than Mino soils. Swanton soils are on similar topographic positions as Mino soils, and Munuscong soils are on lower parts of the landscape. Malone, Georgia and Hogansburg soils formed in glacial till and are higher on the landscape than Mino soils."

    "content": "REMARKS: The great group of Endoaquepts was established in 1992 by the 5th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Competing series are expected to change as similar soils are reclassified. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (Ap and E horizons).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 24 inches (Bg and Bw horizons).\nc. Aquept suborder -the zone from 16 to 24 inches (Bw horizon) having aquic conditions between 16 and 20 inches of surface and an ochric epipedon that is underlain by a horizon having matrix or faces of peds with 50% or more chroma 2 or less and redoximorphic concentrations- the zone from 12 to 16 inches (Bg horizon)\nd. Aeric Endoaquept subgroup - between the Ap horizon and 30 inches, a horizon with matrix color of 10YR hue and value and chroma of 3 or more: (Bw horizon 16-24 inches).\ne.  Nonacid feature - all horizons in the control section have pH values above 5.5.\nSoil Interpretation Record No:NY0366\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
