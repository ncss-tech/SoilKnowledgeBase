Depth to gleying or low chroma mottles ranges from 22 to 36 inches.  Clay percentage of the particle-size control section ranges from 8 to 18 percent.  Coarser-textured lenses of coarse sand or fine gravel, less than 4 cm. thick, occur below 28 inches in depth.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizons have a hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C and 2C horizons have hues of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 5 through 8, chroma of 0 through 4.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Novina, Ovina, and Wann soils lack the coarse sand or gravelly sand above a depth of 40 inches.  Sunset soils have a xeric moisture regime."
