  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 53 degrees F.  Throughout the soil profile organic carbon irregularly decreases with increasing depth.  Depth to gleying or low chroma mottles ranges from 22 to 36 inches.  Clay percentage of the particle-size control section ranges from 8 to 18 percent.  Coarser-textured lenses of coarse sand or fine gravel, less than 4 cm. thick, occur below 28 inches in depth.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizons have a hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C and 2C horizons have hues of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 5 through 8, chroma of 0 through 4.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The Alda series may be saturated longer than 90 days during the growing season and the salinity is less than 4 mmhos throughout.  Novina, Ovina, and Wann soils lack the coarse sand or gravelly sand above a depth of 40 inches.  Sunset soils have a xeric moisture regime."
