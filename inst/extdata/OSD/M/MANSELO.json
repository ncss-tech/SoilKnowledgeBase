  "OVERVIEW": "The Manselo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on stream and lake terraces, inset fans, beach plains, and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

(A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: The zone of carbonate accumulation from a depth of about 13 to 60 inches. (Bkq horizons)\nDurinodic feature: The soil has a subhorizon that is greater than 15 cm thick within 1 m of the surface that is brittle and has a firm consistency when moist.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\".  The cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on NASIS data."
