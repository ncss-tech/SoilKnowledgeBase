Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from basic and intermediate igneous rocks but partly from sedimentary rocks including limestone.  The mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 50 F., and the average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

(A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: The zone of carbonate accumulation from a depth of about 13 to 60 inches. (Bkq horizons)\nDurinodic feature: The soil has a subhorizon that is greater than 15 cm thick within 1 m of the surface that is brittle and has a firm consistency when moist.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\".  The cation exchange activity class is an estimate based on NASIS data.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
