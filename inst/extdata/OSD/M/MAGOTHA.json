  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  In the past Magotha soils were included in the miscellaneous land class Tidal Marsh, High Phase.  These soils support only salt tolerant vegetation which aids in defining limits of wetlands according to Silberhorn (Silberhorn, G.M. 1976.  Tidal wetland plants of Virginia.  Va. Inst. Marine Sci. Gloucester Point, Virginia. Ed. Series No. 19).  The classification of these soils as Typic Natraqualfs is based on SAR values defined by the following expression.  (Na) / (Ca) + (Mg) /2)and one half where ( ) is meq/1 for the saturation extract without prior leaching.  The observed values method range from 25 to 60.  These soils would classify as members of the coarse-loamy, mixed, thermic family of Typic Almyraqualfs according to the Committee VIII report on soils of coastal wetlands, their classification and correlation, except they do not have a peraquic moisture regime.  A natric horizon to a depth of 20 inches or more, salinity, and flooding by salt water are the main diagnostic features.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University soil survey lab data support a coarse-loamy, mixed, thermic Typic Natraqualfs placement for the typical pedon and 9 other profiles.  Data for the official site location and other pedons are published in Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 85-8, 1985, \"Soil Classifications and Floral Relationships of Seaside Salt Marsh Soils in Accomac and Northampton Counties, Virginia\" by W.
