  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Cultivation and rangeland. Cultivated crops are small grain, and grain sorghum. The climax plant community is a mid grass prairie. The dominant grasses are little bluestem and sideoats grama. Other grasses include Texas wintergrass, silver bluestem, Arizona cottontop, dropseeds, slim tridens, green sprangletop, buffalograss, Wright's threeawn, plains bristlegrass, and curly mesquite. The woody plant is live oak. Forbs include bushsunflower, orange zexmenia, and gayfeather. With heavy stocking rates the site could potentially deteriorate to a plan population of buffalograss, curly mesquite, threeawns, agarito, and lotebush. If destructive grazing practices continue, the site will revert to a plant population of lotebush, prickly pear, Texas persimmon, tasajillo, agarito, threeawns, red grama, Texas grama, hairy tridens, prairie coneflower, and broomweed."

Updated the competing series, geographic setting, and associated soils sections.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 48 cm (0 to 19 in) (A and Bw horizons)\nPetrocalcic horizon: 48 to 58 cm (19 to 23 in) (Bkkm horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 58 to 152 cm (23 to 60 in) (BCkk and BCk horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data from McCullogh County, TX, pedon S09TX307004 (lab number 09N2917- 09N02922)\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
