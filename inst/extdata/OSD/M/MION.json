  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mion soils are on hills, ridges, and plains at elevations of 5,500 to 7,800 feet.  Slopes are 1 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in fine textured material weathered from shale, claystone or sandstone.  The climate is semiarid continental with mean annual air temperature of 47 to 56 degrees F., and a mean summer temperature of 65 to 70 degrees F.  Annual precipitation is 10 to 18 inches with about 70 percent falling during the frost-free season, which lasts 115 to 160 days."
