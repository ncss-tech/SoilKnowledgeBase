  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed in fine textured material weathered from shale, claystone or sandstone.  The climate is semiarid continental with mean annual air temperature of 47 to 56 degrees F., and a mean summer temperature of 65 to 70 degrees F.  Annual precipitation is 10 to 18 inches with about 70 percent falling during the frost-free season, which lasts 115 to 160 days."
