    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marana soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in silty textured stream alluvium of Holocene Age.  The alluvium is derived from acid and basic igneous rock such as granite, schist, rhyolite, andesite, quartzite and basalt rocks.  Elevations are 1100 to 2000 feet.  The climate is hot arid continental.  The average annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 67 to 75 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 250 to 350 days."

Gadsden, Gilman, and Glenbar soils lack cambic horizons and are on floodplains.  Gadsden soils are fine.  Saminiego soils are clayey over fine-silty.  Sasco soils are coarse- silty.  Saminiego and Sasco soils are on adjacent stream terraces."
