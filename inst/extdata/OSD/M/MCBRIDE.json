  "OVERVIEW": "The McBride series consists of very deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep to a fragipan. The McBride soils formed in till and are on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 2 to 45 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
