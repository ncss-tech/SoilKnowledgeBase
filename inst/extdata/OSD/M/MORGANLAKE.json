  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy mantle and depth to till range from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 8 percent in the sandy mantle and from 3 to 15 percent in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum.  Cobbles range from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the sandy mantle but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the till.  Free carbonates typically are absent to 60 inches or more but are at 40 to 60 inches in some pedons. Redox accumulations are below the spodic horizon, but within 40 inches. Redox depletions are below a depth of 30 inches in some pedons. Saturation occurs within 40 inches for 1 month or more per year in most years.  Sandy substratum phases below 60 inches are recognized.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is  0 to 2.  The Ap or A horizon is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nSome pedons have a Bhs Horizon.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR and value and chroma 4 to 6.  It is sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Bw horizons with spodic color have organic carbon content less than 0.6 percent.\nSome pedons have an E' or E/B horizon.\nSome pedons have a 2E horizon with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sand, loamy sand, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nMorganlake soils have a glossic horizon (2E/B or 2B/E horizons, or both.)  The 2E part has color and texture like the 2E horizon described above.  The 2Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The argillic horizon averages 15 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser and 18 to 35 percent clay in at least the upper 5 inches.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon with color and texture like the 2Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with color and texture like the 2C horizon described below.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam."

The poorly drained and very poorly drained Brevort soils, the somewhat poorly drained Iosco soils, and the well drained Menominee soils form a drainage sequence with Morganlake soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Crossett and the moderately well drained Ellwood soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the sandy mantle is absent.  The excessively drained Rubicon soils are nearby in areas where the sandy outwash is more than 60 inches thick."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained.  Surface runoff is negligible to low depending on the slope.  Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the sandy mantle and moderately slow or moderate in the till.  The representative depth to perched wet soil moisture status ranges from 1.5 to 3.5 feet below the surface at some time during the months of September through May."
