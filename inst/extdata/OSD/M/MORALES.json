  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The E horizon is considered for the purpose of classification as an albic horizon.  The moist chromas exceed the limits as defined for an albic horizon. Microscopic observations indicate the sand grains are not coated and the high chromas are assumed to be the moist reflection due to a relatively small percentage of sand grain containing embedded high chroma impurities.  The classification is changed from Aeric Glossaqualfs to Aquic Glossudalfs based on the soil moisture study \"ISCOM VIII, Classification and Management of Wet Soils, 1990.\"  This soil does not have an aquic moisture regime. The classification is changed from Aquic Glossudalfs to Oxyaquic Glossudalfs based on soil moisture monitoring on a similar soil on  a similar landform, which did not have aquic conditions during normal years. The pedon was revised in March 2016 to reflect lab data from the type location.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (A and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 38 to 194 cm (15 to 76 in) (Bt/E, Bt and BCt horizons)\nGlossic horizon: 20 to 47 cm (8 to 18in) as streaks, pockets and tongues of Albic materials.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data on site id S1982239003 (Pedon number: 82P0869)\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
