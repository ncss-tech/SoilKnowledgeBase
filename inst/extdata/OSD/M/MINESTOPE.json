  "OVERVIEW": "The Minestope series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in quartz monzonite, granite or other coarse grained igneous or metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on hillslopes, ridges, bedrock floored pediments, and mountain flanks in foothills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
