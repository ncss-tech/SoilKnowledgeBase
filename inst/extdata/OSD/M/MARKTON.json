  "OVERVIEW": "The Markton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy deposits and the underlying loamy till on moraines and till plains. Permeability is rapid in the sandy deposits and moderate in the loamy till. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
