Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 39 inches, frost-free period ranges from 130 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 580 to 1,530 feet above sea level."

Brems, Metea, Plainfield, and Wawasee soils are on higher-lying areas and are better drained. Brems and Plainfield soils are sandy, and Wawasee soils are loamy throughout the profile. Crosier soils are in the same setting as Markton soils and have more clay in the upper part of the solum. Gilford soils are in lower-lying areas, are grayer throughout, and are sandy in the lower part. Morocco soils are in the same setting as Markton soils and are sandy throughout the profile."
