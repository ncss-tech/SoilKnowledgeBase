Copus soils are in adjacent basins, are moderately acid to neutral below the Ap horizon, and do not have intersecting slickensides.  Fages soils are on similar landforms and have an SAR of 45 to 120 in the cambic horizon.  Garces and Tennco soils are on similar landforms and have a natric horizon.  Zalvidea soils are on similar landforms, are coarse-loamy, and have a gypsic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\nOchric epipedon -- the zone from the soil surface to 5 inches (Ap).  Millox soils do not have a mollic epipedon even though the moist color value is 3 and it has more than 1 percent organic matter to a depth of 25 cm.  This is because the dry color value of the Bw horizon is 6.  Millox soils do, however, make the mollic intergrade subgroup because taxonomy requires only the moist color value to be mollic in half of the upper 30 cm.\nCambic horizon -- the zone from about 5 to 19 inches (Bw).\nParticle size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
