  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the profile are:\nOchric epipedon -- the zone from the soil surface to 5 inches (Ap).  Millox soils do not have a mollic epipedon even though the moist color value is 3 and it has more than 1 percent organic matter to a depth of 25 cm.  This is because the dry color value of the Bw horizon is 6.  Millox soils do, however, make the mollic intergrade subgroup because taxonomy requires only the moist color value to be mollic in half of the upper 30 cm.\nCambic horizon -- the zone from about 5 to 19 inches (Bw).\nParticle size control section - the zone from 10 to 40 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
