The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 380 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, the mean summer temperature is 18 to 21 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 140 days."

Redfield soils lack mollic epipedons and have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Red Rock soils have mollic epipedons more than 50 cm thick."

Soil Taxonomy requires a thickness of 25 cm for a mollic epipedon if it has irregular organic carbon or if no diagnostic horizons below.
