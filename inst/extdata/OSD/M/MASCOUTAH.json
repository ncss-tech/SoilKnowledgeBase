    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development is 48 to 74 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 24 inches in thickness and extends into the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons.  Carbonates, where present, typically occur in the C horizon, but they occur in the B horizon below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay.  Sand content is less than 7 percent in all parts of the series control section.  Many pedons contain krotovina.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 56 to slightly less than 59 degrees F.\nThe upper part of the control section (Ap, A, or AB, where present) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3 (3 or 4 dry); and chroma of 0 or 1.  Some A horizons contain redoximorphic masses of iron accumulation with value and chroma higher than those of the matrix.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon.\nThe second part of the control section (Bg or Btg) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5 in the upper part and 4 to 6 in the lower part; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Most pedons contain redoximorphic features with high or low chroma or both.  Clay content is 27 to 35 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe third part of the control section (BCtg) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Clay content is 20 to 32 percent.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe lower part of the control section (Cg) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It typically is silt loam, but is silty clay loam in the upper part in some pedons.  Clay content is 18 to 30 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

The somewhat poorly drained Bethalto and Edwardsville soils are on slightly higher or more sloping landform positions nearby.  The moderately well drained Downsouth soils and the well drained Wakenda soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes above the Mascoutah soils.  In addition, the Bethalto and Downsouth soils do not have a mollic epipedon and typically are nearer the drainageways."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Mascoutah soils were formerly included with the Sable series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 21 inches (Ap, A, and AB horizons).  Cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 21 to 66 inches (Bg, Btg1, Btg2, and BCg horizons).  Aquic conditions - periodic saturation and reduction indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  For lab analysis refer to University of Illinois Nos.  20836-20845, sampled on November 14, 1967 about 0.25 mile south of typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
