The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 16 inches.  Annual snowfall is 20 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The average January temperature is 27 to 29 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 to 68 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 130 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of August 2004 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Argiduridic Durixerolls based on laboratory data and the series concept centered in volcanic ash influenced areas of MLRA 21.  Modoc components in MLRA 28A need correlation to another series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic Horizon - The zone from 21 to 34 inches (Bt horizon).\nDuripan - The zone from 34 to 55 inches (Bqkm1 and Bqkm2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 21 to 34 inches (Bt horizon).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S80CA-093-015 (pedon # 80P0458).  The control section is 27.9 percent clay.  This soil probably did not disperse well because 2.5 X 17.1 (15 bar water) = 42.75.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
