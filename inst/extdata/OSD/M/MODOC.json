  "OVERVIEW": "The Modoc series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits or alluvium derived from basalt, andesite, and pyroclastic rocks.  Modoc soils are on lake terraces and fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of August 2004 updates the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Argiduridic Durixerolls based on laboratory data and the series concept centered in volcanic ash influenced areas of MLRA 21.  Modoc components in MLRA 28A need correlation to another series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic Horizon - The zone from 21 to 34 inches (Bt horizon).\nDuripan - The zone from 34 to 55 inches (Bqkm1 and Bqkm2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 21 to 34 inches (Bt horizon).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S80CA-093-015 (pedon # 80P0458).  The control section is 27.9 percent clay.  This soil probably did not disperse well because 2.5 X 17.1 (15 bar water) = 42.75.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
