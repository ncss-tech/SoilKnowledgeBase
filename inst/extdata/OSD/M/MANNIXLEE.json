  "OVERVIEW": "The Mannixlee series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils occur on stream terraces, depressions and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
