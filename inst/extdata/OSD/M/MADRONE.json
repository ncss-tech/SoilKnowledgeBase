    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Madrone soils are on hills and mountains. Bedrock is of extrusive igneous rocks such as rhyolite, trachyte, or related igneous rocks.  The regolith is a moderately deep stony mantle over igneous bedrock.  Slopes are mostly 8 to 45 percent.  They are on the higher elevations of mountains usually between 5,575 and 7,800 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 26 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 59 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 160 to 200 days."
