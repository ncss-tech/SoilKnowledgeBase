    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 36 inches; with average being about 26 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches, but most pedons have bedrock at depths of 36 inches or less.  Rock fragment content ranges from 15 to 60 percent by volume in the A horizon and averages about 30 percent.  Rock fragment content in the B horizon ranges from 45 to 75 percent by volume and averages about 60 percent.  The C horizon averages at least 70 percent by volume of rock fragments and in some places the amount is over 90 percent.  There are stony and very stony phases of Mt. Airy soils, and outcrops of the extremely hard schist are fairly common.  The soil is strongly to extremely acid throughout the profile unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2/5Y but is centered on 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Lower value and chroma are in the A1 and higher value and chroma are in the A2.  Tex- ture of the A horizon is channery silt loam or channery loam or the very channery analogues of these textures.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, but is centered on 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is channery silt loam, channery loam, channery clay loam or the very or extremely channery analogues of these textures.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 5 through 7,\nand chroma of 4 through 6.  Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from loam to clay loam.  It ranges from channery to extremely chan- nery.\nCOMPETING SERIES  The Mt. Airy series is the only member of this family.\nThe Berks, Cardiff, Catoctin, Chandler, Elliber, Manor, and Talla- dega series are similar soils in related families.  The Berks, Car- diff, Catoctin and Elliber soils contain less mica than Mt. Airy soils, have mixed minerology and do not have coarse fragments dominated by mica schist.  Chandler soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments and bedrock is at a depth of 4 feet or deeper.  Talladega soils have an argillic horizon less than 10 inches thick, or interrupted by ledges of bedrock, and a lithic contact within 20 inches of the surface.  Manor soils contain less than 30 percent coarse fragments and bedrock is at a depth of 60 inches or more."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mt. Airy soils have formed in a regolith weathered mainly from hard mica schists and phyllites, or locally from granitized or chlorite schists.  They are on the northern portions of the inner Piedmont Plateau, on strongly dissected uplands.  The slope gradient commonly ranges from 8 to 25 percent, but the complete range is 0 to 75 percent.  The climate is temperate and humid; mean annual temperature is 50 degrees to 55 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Mean annual snowfall ranges from about 10 to 40 inches."

Chester, Elioak, Glenelg, and Linganore soils have argillic horizons, Glenville soils have fragipans and the Codorus, Comus and Hatboro soils are on nearby floodplains."

There are many, though usually not large, wooded areas, and in places much urban and suburban development.  Natural vegetation is of mixed hardwoods, dominated by black oak, chestnut oak, hickory, yellow pop- lar, and red maple, and having an understory or dogwood, holly, and huckleberry, and some areas with laurel and azalea."
