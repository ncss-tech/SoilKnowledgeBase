  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from 24 to 45 inches. Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Dark or very dark colors associated with dark colored shale dominate the entire pedon. The C horizon contains more than 1 percent organic matter. In the darkest color pedons, the boundary between A and B horizons is evident only by the change from granular to blocky structure. However, in these pedons the C horizon has 1 percent or less carbon content difference than the uppermost B subhorizon. Clay skins are evident only in the lower subhorizon of Bt. Friable shale fragments, part of which disperse upon mechanical analysis, range from few in the upper horizons to common of some B horizons. Hard gravel and stones range from none to 20 percent of the solum.\nThe Ap horizon has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or loam. Structure is granular or subangular blocky parting to granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BA or BE horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or platy. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral\nThe Bw or Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3, when crushed it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is predominantly loam or silt loam, but subhorizons in some pedons may include fine sandy loam or silty clay loam. Structure is moderate or strong, fine to coarse blocky with thin clay skins on none to 20 percent of ped faces in the upper part and 10 to 40 percent in the lower part of the Bt horizon. Consistence is friable, very friable, or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. The lowest subhorizon is slightly effervescent in some pedons.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is predominantly loam or silt loam, but includes fine sandy loam and silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, angular or subangular blocky, or platy. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C or Cd horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, chroma of 2 or 3. It is massive or has plate-like divisions. Consistence is firm. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline, and slightly to violently effervescent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Dunbridge, Lauramie, Longlois, Lydick, Oneco, and Razort series are members of the same family. None of these has the dark inherited colors and relatively high carbon throughout that characterizes Mohawk. In addition, Dunbridge soils have bedrock above 40 inches, Lauramie and Longlois soils have discontinuities of material within or immediately below the solum, Lydick soils have a thick solum and a sandy C horizon, Oneco soils have limestone bedrock at 40 to 60 inches, and Razort soils formed in alluvium, have rare flooding, and have a thicker solum.\nThe Baltimore, Blooming, Dowagiac, Neda, Newcomer, Orwood, Sebbo, Taopi, and Waucoma soils are similar, but do not have CEC assigned. None of these has the dark inherited colors and relatively high organic carbon throughout that characterizes Mohawk. Among other related soils, Honeoye and Lima have lighter-colored B and/or C horizons which contain less carbon. Among soils high in dark shale, Manheim has distinct redoximorphic features in the solum, Palatine has bedrock within 40 inches and lacks an argillic horizon, and Herkimer has a coarser water-sorted C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mohawk series is on till plains and till-mantled dissected plateaus. Slope ranges 3 to 15 percent, but may range to 30 percent. The regolith is firm basal till mainly from black soft shale. It is generally calcareous, but of variable lime content, including limestone. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches; mean annual air temperature from 46 degrees to 50 degrees F; and mean growing season, from 130 to 180 days."

Palatine soils are the moderately deep associates. Herkimer soils are on nearby alluvial fans. Locally Mohawk areas grade into areas of Honeoye, Lansing, and Danley series and their wetter associates."
