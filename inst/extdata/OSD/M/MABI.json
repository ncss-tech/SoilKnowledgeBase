Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A or Ap horizon, from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the Bss horizons and from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the Bgss horizons.    Mabi soils have cracks that open and close more than once a year but do not remain open for more than 90 cumulative days, in most years.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 1 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is clay.\nThe upper part of the Bss horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2.5 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown and red range from few to many.  Texture is clay.\nThe lower Bss and Bkss horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2.5 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 2.5.

Coloso soils are on adjacent lower flood plain positions and have kaolinitic mineralogy.  Gurabo soils are on similar positions, but have clayey over sandy layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  The moderately well drained Montegrande soils and Rio Arriba are on higher positions.  In addition, the Arriba Rio soils have an argillic horizon and less clay in the control section."
