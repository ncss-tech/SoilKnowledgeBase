  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges 8 to 16 inches. Depth to the horizon of carbonate accumulation ranges 16 to 24 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 24 to 40 inches. The ca horizon may be weakly to moderately cemented. Coarse fragments are mainly gravel and cobbly size rounded to slightly angular limestone rock fragments, ranging to volume about 20 to 50 percent in the Al horizon and 35 to 70 percent in the Cca and C horizon. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at about 20 inches depth ranges 65 to 70 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 consecutive days or more in the 8 to 24 inch depth.\nThe Al horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value is 3 to 5.5 dry, 2 to 3.5 moist and chroma is 2 or 3. Organic matter content ranges from 1 to 3 percent; structure is weak to moderate fine to medium granular in the upper portion and weak medium to coarse subangular blocky in the lower portion; reaction is mildly to moderately alkaline; moderately to strongly calcareous. The texture of the control section averages very gravelly light loam.\nThe AC horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5y, value is 5 or 6 dry, 4 moist and chroma is 2 or 3; texture is very gravelly loam, gravelly loam or very gravelly silt loam; structure is weak to moderate fine to medium subangular blocky or is massive; reaction is mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline; strongly to moderately calcareous.\nThe Cca and C horizons have a hue of 10YR or 2.5y, value is 5 through 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist and chromas are 2 and 3; texture is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly loam; reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline; strongly to very strongly calcareous."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Blackrock soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick, lack calcic horizons and contain less than 35 percent gravel and cobble in the control section. Green Canyon soils lack calcic horizons and have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalents. Pharo soils lack a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches and are continuously moist less than one-half the time the temperature is above 41 degrees F. Picayune soils have noncalcareous mollic epipedon and contain less than 35 percent gravel and cobble in the control section. Richmond soils lack both mollic epipedons and calcic horizons and are less than 20 inches deep over limestone bedrock. Sterling soils have mollic epipedons resting directly on calcic horizons and are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Welby and Calita soils lack coarse fragments in the control section."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Munk soils are at elevations of 4,500 to 6,000 feet above sea level on moderately steep to very steep mountain slopes, with slopes of 10 to 70 percent. The soils formed in materials from light colored tuff, conglomerate, tuffaceous sandstone and limestone. The climate is moist subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 14 to 17 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.; mean summer temperature is 68 to 71 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
