  "OVERVIEW": "The Morscour series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed mainly in residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Morscour soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered tuff or tuff-breccia.\nSodium fluoride pH - 8.5 to 9.5.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 12 to 18 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly gravel.  Lithology of fragments are volcanic rocks such as tuff and granitic rocks such as granodiorite.\nA horizons - Value: 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3, dry or moist.\nClay content: 12 to 18 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 60 percent.\nPararock fragments: 0 to 25 percent paragravel.\nOrganic matter content: 2 to 4 percent.\nReaction: Moderately acid to neutral."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Morscour soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions which have been scoured by glacial ice.  They formed mainly in residuum derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Minor amounts of  till and colluvium derived from mixed rocks occurs as surface deposits.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 9,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, mean annual temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 7 inches to underlying soft bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nThe revision of October 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, isotic, shallow Xeric Haplocryolls.  The isotic mineralogy class was based solely on the field determined values for sodium fluoride pH.  Laboratory data on 15 bar water to clay ratio does not exist to verify the isotic mineralogy class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
