    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to weathered granitic rock is 40 to 60 inches.  Combined thickness of the A and Bw horizon is 15 to 36 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent fine gravel but any one horizon may range from 10 to 55 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section between the depths of 10 and 30 inches is dry in all parts from about mid July to about mid October (90 to 100 days).  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about mid April to late November (230 to 240 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about mid May to mid November.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 90 percent (ammonium acetate).\nThe A horizon is 10YR 7/3, 5/3, 5/2, 6/2, 4/1, 5/1, 6/3, 5/4, 6/4, or 2.5Y 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/2, 3/3, 3/2, or 3/1.  The A horizon contains 5 to 15 percent fine pebbles.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 8/3, 5/3, 6/4, 5/4, 7/2, 6/4, 5/2, 7/3, or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 5/4, 4/3, 3/3, 3/4, 5/2, 6/2, 5/3 or 4/4.  It is sandy loam, gravelly coarse sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  It has 10 to 20 percent fine pebbles, and 10 to 17 percent clay.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon is very gravelly coarse sandy loam, gravelly coarse sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  It has 25 to 55 percent fine pebbles, and 5 to 11 percent clay."

The Arrastre and Bestrom soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Barron soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F and are greater than 60 inches deep.  Cassolary soils have unconformable silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam layers within 40 inches.  Clayton soils have E horizons.   Frailey soils have loam or gravelly loam textures in the particle-size control section and are dry for 60 to 80 days.  Green Bluff soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have a component of ash and pyroclastic material and are dry for 60 to 80 days.  Hudnut soils are dry only 75 to 90 days in the summer, have sand textures at 40 to more than 60 inches, and have rock fragments dominantly greater than 5 mm.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification was updated in February 2001 using the Eighth Edition to Soil Taxonomy. This series was formerly classified as coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Typic Xerochrepts. Competing series were not checked at that time.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface to 5 inches (A horizon).\nCambic horizon--the zone from 5 to 30 inches (Bw1, Bw2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section--the zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bw1, Bw2, C horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Pedon sampled by Lincoln Lab for complete characterization, October, 1983, NSSL samples 84P407-411.\nBase saturation measured at: Bw1=65 percent, Bw2=75 percent (ammonium acetate).  Other NSSL data on Minersville pedons range from 60 to 90 percent base saturation.  Data is consistently well above 60 percent base saturation for all Xerochrepts identified on the Shasta Bally Batholith in Trinity County.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
