  "OVERVIEW": "The Mecklenburg series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from intermediate and mafic crystalline rocks of the Piedmont uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 45 inches, and mean annual temperature is 59 degrees near the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 5 feet. The soil ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and is moderately acid to neutral in the B and C horizons. Content of rock fragments of gravel and cobble size range from 0 to 30 percent by volume in the A horizon and 0 to 10 percent in the B horizon. Manganese concretions are few to many in the A and B horizons. Content of flakes of mica ranges from none to few.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. A or Ap horizons with moist values less than 4 are less than 6 inches thick. The A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or their gravelly analogues. Eroded phases are sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. In the upper part, value is 3 to 6 and chroma is 4 to 8. In the lower part, value is 4 to 6 and chroma is 4 to 8. Few to common mottles in shades of brown, yellow or red are in the lower Bt horizon in most pedons. The Bt horizon is clay with clay content from 40 to 60 percent.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8 and is often mottled in these colors. It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam, and contains up to 25 percent saprolite.\nThe C horizon is mottled or multicolored saprolite weathered from mafic crystalline rock. It is variable in texture but typically is loamy."

Those in closely related families are Coronaca, Iredell, and Wilkes series. Brantley, Canton Bend, Capshaw, Cowton, Hallsummit, and Maben soils are more acid in the B horizons than Mecklenburg. Coronaca soils have moist colors of values of less than 4 throughout. Enon, Hampshire, Iredell, and Zuber soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt horizon; and in addition Zuber soils have sandy A and AB horizons. Gundy soils are more permeable and developed from slate or fine grained schist. Magnet soils are more permeable and formed in residuum from syenite and other intrusive igneous rocks. Spray soils developed from mudstone, siltstone, or shale. Wilkes and Zion soils have bedrock at a depth of less than 40 inches."
