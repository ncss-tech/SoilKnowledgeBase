  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to continuous carbonates in the soil matrix is typically 24 to 60 inches or more.  Two to 15 percent by volume of soft to hard sandstone fragments that range dominantly from about 1/8 to 3 inches in size occur mostly throughout the lower part of the profile. The sandstone fragments are calcareous in some profiles and noncalcareous in others.  In some pedons, both are present.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Horizons having values of less than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist are less than 10 inches thick.  Texture is dominantly loamy fine sand but includes loamy sand, fine sand and sand.  It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 and 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Duda, Peji, Royosa, Simeon, Tonalea, and Valentine series in the same family.  Duda Peji and Tonalea soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Royosa and  Tonalea soils are in an area with a drier climate(See Remarks).  Royosa and Valentine soils formed in eolian materials and have fewer or no sandstone fragments in the pedon. Simeon soils average more than 35 percent medium and coarse sand in the control section and do not have sandstone fragments in the pedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McKelvie soils are on back slopes, foot slopes and toe slopes of valley sides.  They are formed in sandy residuum weathered from sandstone with additions of eolian sand on foot slopes and toe slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 80 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Duda Fishberry, Ronson and Simeon soils.  Duda, Ronson and Simeon soils are higher on the landscape than McKelvie soils.  Duda and Ronson soils have sandstone at depths between 20 and 40 inches. Ronson soils also have a mollic epipedon and are coarse-loamy.  Fishberry soils have sandstone at depths between 10 and 20 inches and are on shoulders."
