    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil commonly is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, except the surface layer in areas that have been limed.  Some pedons are medium acid below a depth of 40 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section has 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon, less than 4 inches thick with value of 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 3, commonly with few to many mottles with chroma of 2 or less; or it has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 8 with mottles having chroma of 2 or less.  In some pedons the horizon is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, or gray.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, commonly with mottles in shades of brown.  In some pedons the horizon is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  Brown and black concretions are commonly few to many."

Closely related series are the Arkabutla, Belden, Commerce, Chenneby, Falaya, Gillsburg, Houlka, Mantachie, Rosebloom, and Urbo.  Arkabutla and Chenneby soils have mixed mineralogy.  Also, Chenneby soils have a cambic horizon and do not have a horizon with a gray matrix within a depth of 20 inches.  Belden and Commerce soils have mixed mineralogy and are nonacid in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Falaya and Gillsburg are coarse-silty in the particle-size control section.  Houlka and Urbo are fine in the particle-size control section.  Mantachie soils are fine-loamy in the particle-size control section.  Rosebloom soils have a gray matrix below the base of the A horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mathiston soils are on flood plains of streams that drain areas of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  These are nearly level soils that formed in silty alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual precipitation is 51.0 inches, and mean annual temperature is 68 degrees Fahrenheit near the type location."
