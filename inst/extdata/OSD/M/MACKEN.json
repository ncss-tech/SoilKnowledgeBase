  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonate ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 22 to 34 inches.  The control section averages between 45 to 60 percent clay.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry.  It typically is silty clay loam but is silty clay or clay in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw and Bg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It has weak or moderate, medium or coarse prismatic structure that parts to moderate or strong, fine or medium angular or subangular blocky.  It is silty clay or clay and ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam or clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Most pedons contain few or common, fine or medium accumulations of carbonates.  Buried horizons are below depths of 36 inches in some pedons.  Some pedons have C horizons."

Cosmos soils have 2Bk horizons of glacial till containing up to 5 percent rock fragments within depths of 40 inches.  In addition, they formed in areas having mean annual precipitation of more than 26 inches.   Cove soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 60 inches.  Marna soils have a loam or clay loam glacial till 2Bk horizon within depths of 40 inches.  Waldorf soils formed in areas having mean annual precipitation of more than 25 inches."
