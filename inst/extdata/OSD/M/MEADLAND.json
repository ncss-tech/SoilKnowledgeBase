  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 20 to 48 inches.  The particle-size control section averages from 18 to 30 percent clay.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and from 2 to 30 percent in the substratum. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and substratum. A stony phase is recognized in some places.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the soil but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Redox accumulations cab be throughout the soil below the A horizon. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and saturation occurs there for some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR; value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the Ap or A horizon is loam or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a Bs horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. These horizons, however, are too thin or do not meet the chemical requirements for spodic.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nMeadland soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both the E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 8. In some pedons the colors are variegated. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay laom or the gravelly analogs.\nThe C horizon has color anf texture like the BC horizon described above."

Alstad soils hve carbonates within a depth of 80 inches and contain some shale fragments. Big Iron and Keewatin soils have a densic contact in the lower part of the series control section. Kert soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Milladore and Withee soils have a 12 to 36 inch mantle with more than 50 percent silt.  Nary soils have carbonates at a depth of 30 to 60 inches. Point soils have a 10 to 20 inch thick sandy mantle. Rietbrock soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occupy plane and concave slopes of ground moraines underlain by igneous and metamorphic bedrock.  Slopes  range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in loamy glacial till or loamy residuum weathered from metamorphic and igneous rocks or a mixture of the two. The till is composed mainly of local materials, but the glacial stratigraphy in the area where these soils occur has not been fully worked out. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 34 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F."
