  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 55 inches and coincides with depth to bedrock. Some pedons have a thin loess mantle up to 15 inches thick. The solum typically does not have coarse fragments but some pedons have up to 2 percent by volume, especially in the B horizon immediately overlying the bedrock. The A horizon is moderately acid to neutral and the B horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Where present, the A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3 and is 2 to 5 inches thick. The Ap or A horizon is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 5. Textures are similar to the Ap or A horizons, but the clay content is somewhat lower.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value and chroma is 4 or 5. It is sandy loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value and chroma is 4 to 6. It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam. The clay content increases with depth in the Bt horizons reaching its maximum in subhorizons just above the bedrock. The particle-size control section averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and from 30 to 60 percent fine sand or coarser. Clay films are faint and patchy on faces of peds in the upper Bt horizon, but become nearly continuous in the lower part. In some pedons, the sandy limestone or sandy dolomite is continuous; in other pedons it is jointed to depths of several feet."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amanda, Belmont, Belmore, Chenault, Chili, Coggon, Conestoga, Douds, El Dara, Gallman, Grellton, Hayden, Hebron, Hickory, High Gap, Hollinger, Kalamazoo, Kanawha, Kendallville, Kidder, Kosciusko, LeRoy, Letort, Lindley, Mandeville, Martinsville, McHenry, Miami, Military, Nodine, Norden, Ockley, Owosso, Pecatonica, Princeton, Rawson, Relay, Renova, Richland, Riddles, Rockbridge, Roseville, Sisson, Strawn, Summitville, Theresa, Wawasee, Westville, Whalan, and Woodbine soils in the same family. All of these soils except Belmont, Chenault, Grayford, High Gap, Mandeville, Military, Norden, Roseville, Summitville, Whalan, and Woodbine do not have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 60 inches. Belmont soils have limestone at depths of 40 to 60 inches, but have more clay and less sand in the control section. Chenault soils have less sand in the B horizons and more coarse fragments. High Gap soils have stratified sandstone, shale, and siltstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Mandeville soils are underlain by soft silty shales at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Military and Norden soils have sandstone at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Roseville soils have limestone at depths of 40 to 60 inches, but have the major part of the B horizon formed in till. In addition, they have more pebbles and weatherable minerals in the B horizon. Summitville soils have a paralithic contact with interbedded red clay shale, siltstone, and sandstone at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Whalan soils have a lithic contact of limestone at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Woodbine soils have limestone at depths of 40 to 60 inches, but have silty clay or clay textures in the lower part of the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mifflin soils are on nearly level to steep convex and plane slopes on upland ridges underlain by limestone. Slope gradients dominantly are 6 and 12 percent but range from 2 to 30 percent. The soils formed in a moderately thick mantle of loamy residuum weathered from sandy dolomite or sandy limestone. Limestone is at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 53 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 31 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Fayette, New Glarus, and Palsgrove soils. The Mifflin series is associated with New Glarus soils where sand content of the limestone or dolomite parent rock is so variable as to weather intermittently in the landscape to loamy (Mifflin series) and clayey (New Glarus series) residuum. Palsgrove soils are on positions contiguous to areas of Mifflin soils where the thickness of loess exceeds approximately 30 inches. Fayette soils are on areas of thicker loess."
