The soils are ususally moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 80 consecutive days during the 120-day period following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the solum is 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to contrasting texture is 24 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments are a mixture of basalt and andesite.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, gravelly loam, silt loam, cobbly silt loam, or gravelly silt loam and has 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or gravelly loam, silt loam, bouldery silt loam or gravelly silt loam and has 5 to 35 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 10 to 25 percent boulders.  It is slightly acid to medium acid.\nThe C1 horizon is gravelly silt loam and has 20 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe 2C2 horizon is very gravelly, very bouldery, extremely bouldery, or very cobbly sand or loamy sand.  It has 20 to 75 percent coarse fragments, of which 0 to 30 percent may be cobbles or boulders."

The soils formed in stratified medium and very gravelly or cobbly coarse textured mixed alluvium.  The climate is humid temperate.  The winters are cool and moist and summers are warm and dry.  The mean January temperature is about 39 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  The frost-free season is 165 to 210 days.  The soils are on the Champoeg geomorphic surface."
