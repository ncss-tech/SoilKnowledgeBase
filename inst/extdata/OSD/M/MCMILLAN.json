  "OVERVIEW": "The McMillan series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy over sandy glaciofluvial deposits on recessional moraines and outwash plains. Permeabilty is moderate in the upper subsoil and rapid in the lower subsoil and substratum. Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
