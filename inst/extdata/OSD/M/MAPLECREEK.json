  "OVERVIEW": "The Maplecreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Maplecreek soils are on lake terraces and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
