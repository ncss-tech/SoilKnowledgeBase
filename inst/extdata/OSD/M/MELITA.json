The Melita soils formed in sandy materials overlying loamy materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 838 mm (26 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F). Mean summer temperature ranges from 15.6 to 19.4 degrees C (60 to 67 degrees F)."
