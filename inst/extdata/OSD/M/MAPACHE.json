  "OVERVIEW": "The Mapache series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from latite and dacite.  Mapache soils are on footslopes and backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 10 to 55 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
