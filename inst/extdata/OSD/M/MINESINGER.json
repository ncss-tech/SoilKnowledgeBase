  "OVERVIEW": "The Minesinger series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
