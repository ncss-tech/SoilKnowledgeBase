Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A horizon and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the B horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 and chroma of 2, or value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe upper B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 6 or 8.  Mottles are in shades of yellow or brown.  The lower B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 4 and chroma of 6 or 8 and mottles in shades of gray and brown, or it has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 1 or 2 and mottles in shades of red and brown or it is a mottled horizon in shades of red, brown, and gray.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages 60 to 70 percent clay."

Forbing soils have a higher pH in the subsoil and contains free calcium carbonates.  Annona, Bryarly, Moswell, Susquehanna, and Woodville soils are in a fine particle size class.  Boswell and Gore soils are in a mixed mineralogy class and are in a fine particle size class.  Kipling and Wilcox soils are in a fine particle size class and have a decrease in clay within 60 inches of the soil surface. Oktibbeha, Natchitoches, and Vaiden soils have a decrease in clay within 60 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in acid loamy and clayey marine sediments of Cretaceous age.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches near the type location."

Angie soils, which occur on less dissected areas have lower base saturation and are moderately well drained.  Mayhew soils, which occur on similar landscapes are poorly drained and are underlain by clay shale.  Sacul soils, which occurs on more dissected landscapes have lower base saturation and thinner sola.  Saffel soils, which occur on more dissected landscapes contains large amount of gravel and has lower base saturation. Sawyer soils, which occur on similar landscapes have yellowish brown subsoils and lower base saturation."
