  "OVERVIEW": "The McNeely series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in sandy deposits of the Deweyville Formation of late-Pleistocene to early Holocene age.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.5 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in).",

The latitude and longitude was changed in 2011 because the original coordinates were not at the series type location.\nHorizon designation was changed to better reflect the entisols classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) (A Horizon)\nCoated feature: The fine-earth fraction contains 5 to 10 percent by weight silt plus clay."
