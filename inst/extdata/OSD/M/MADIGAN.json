  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Madigan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum derived from igneous rock. These soils occur on hills and mountain slopes. Slopes are 2 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
