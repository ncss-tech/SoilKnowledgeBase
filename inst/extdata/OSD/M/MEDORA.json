  "OVERVIEW": "The Medora series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess, loamy material and a paleosol in outwash on eskers and crevasse fillings. They are moderately deep or shallow to a fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",
