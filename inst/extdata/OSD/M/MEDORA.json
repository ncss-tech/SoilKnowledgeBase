In severely eroded soils, the depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff ranges from medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the fragipan and low to moderately high in the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow in the fragipan."
