    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent throughout the profile, and range from small angular or rounded pebbles to cobblestones and large stones. The soil is slightly or moderately acid. Base saturation is 40 to 50 percent in the epipedon. Mean annual soil temperature is 41 degrees to 43 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Organic matter content is 3 or 4 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. There is a lightly increase of clay content over the A horizon, but not enough to qualify as an argillic horizon.\nThe C horizon is very cobbly sand or very cobbly coarse sand."

Inpendence soils have a base saturation of 10 to 30 percent that is highest in the surface layer and decreases with depth.
