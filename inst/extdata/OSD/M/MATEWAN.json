  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Matewan soils were proposed to fill the gap left with the reclassification of Dekalb to siliceous mineralogy, based primarily on data from the Allegheny Plateau and other areas of Pennsylvania. A review of lab data for soils sampled as Dekalb in West Virginia and Kentucky indicates that 7 of 11 pedons sampled were mixed and three were siliceous, while one was marginal. Resistant minerals range from about 60 to 89 percent with 78 to 85 being typical. Illite, kaolinite, and vermiculite are common clay minerals. The CEC activity class ranges from semiactive to superactive (3 semiactive, 2 active, 2 superactive), with active being most representative. With the addition of data from five pedons sampled since 1998 (referenced below) the CEC activity class tallies are 4 semiactive, 4 active, and 4 superactive.\nIn West Virginia, the Matewan series is generally found in the Kanawha geologic formation and in younger formations above, while the Dekalb series (siliceous) is found in the older New River formation below (all of Pennsylvanian Age). The Matewan series was proposed in Mingo County, West Virginia, in 1999 as part of the soil survey of Logan and Mingo Counties, West Virginia.\nThe 01/2005 revision changes the status from tentative to established. Additionally, competing series were updated and other minor edits were completed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches (Oe, A and BA horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 30 inches (BA and Bw horizons).\n3. Lithic contact - hard sandstone bedrock at 33 inches (R horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data from characterization samples S86WV-059-003, S86WV-059-005, S81WV-109-006 and S83KY-195-015 were used to develop this series. Additional samples S98PA-129-001, S01WV-081-007, S02WV-019-006, S02WV-081-001, S02WV-081-002, and S02WV-081-005 are also available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska.\nRevised: 8/1999-RNP,DHK; 1/2005-DHK; 8/2014-JDM/MDJ\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
