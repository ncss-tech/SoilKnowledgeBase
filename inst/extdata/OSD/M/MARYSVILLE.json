  "OVERVIEW": "The Marysville series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources over unrelated siltstone.  These soils are on stream terraces with slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Marysville series was originally mapped in the 1909 soil survey of the Marysville area, California.  The series was made inactive because the original type location could not be located and because it had not been mapped elsewhere.  This revision reestablishes the series, a new type location and redefines the concept of the original series.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in January of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon:\nTaxonomic Class:  Fine-silty, mixed, thermic Mollic Haploxeralfs.\nMajor Diagnostic Horizons:\n1.  Ochric Epipedon - 0 TO 6 inches (Ap) ranges from 6 to 8 inches thick.\n1.1  Thickness does not meet requirements for mollic epipedon.\n2.  Argillic Horizon - (Btl, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4) 6 to 36 inches.  Clay content by weighted average for the 6 to 26 inch textural control section is 29 percent.\n2.1 PSA by Hydrometer (Local): #140 sieve % FS or\nHorizon   Depth (in.)   % clay   % silt   % sand    coarser   Ap\n0 -  6        23      47.6     28.4      14.4   Bt1       6 - 13\n28      48.6     23.4       7.0   Bt2      13 - 23        30      48.6   21.4       5.8   Bt3      23 - 31        28      49.6     22.4\n6.6   Bt4      31 - 36        27      50.6     22.4       6.2\n2.2  Clay films present.\nOther Diagnostic Horizons or Soil Characteristics:\n1.  Fine-silty Family:\n1.1  Less than 15 percent of the particles by weight are fine sand or coarser.  (See data 2.1)\n2.  Temperature - Moisture Regime (Xeric-thermic):\n2.1  The 6 to 16 inch SMCS is dry in all parts from May 15 to October 31 and is moist in all parts from November 15 to May 1.\n2.2  The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F.\nf.r the entire year.\n2.3  The MAST is 64 to 66 degrees F."
