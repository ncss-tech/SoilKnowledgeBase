  "OVERVIEW": "The Midvale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium and underlying lacustrine sediments.  The Midvale soils are on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent. Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
