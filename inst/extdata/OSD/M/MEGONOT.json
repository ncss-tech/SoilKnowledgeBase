  "REVDATE": "04/2002",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Megonot series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from semi-consolidated shale, siltstone or mudstone, or in alluvium over semi-consolidated shale, siltstone or mudstone. These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, ridges, strath terraces, sedimentary plains, lake plains, hills, and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
