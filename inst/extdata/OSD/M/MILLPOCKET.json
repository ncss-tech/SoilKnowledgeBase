  "OVERVIEW": "The Millpocket series consists of very deep, well drained, sodium affected soils on lake plains and terraces.  These soils formed in lacustrine or glaciolacustrine deposits.  Slope is 2 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 460 mm, and the average annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
