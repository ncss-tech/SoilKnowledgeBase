These soils formed in thick gravelly and stony igneous alluvium, as dissected fans or terraces presumed to be of Quaternary of Pliocene Age.  The climate is arid to semiarid continental.  The average annual temperature is about 60 degrees to 68 degrees F., the average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches, and Thornthwaite P-E indices about 12 to 22."
