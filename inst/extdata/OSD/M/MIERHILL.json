  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mierhill series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable gravelly soils that formed in gravelly or stony outwash materials from igneous hills and mountains.  These soils are on moderate to strongly sloping convex ridges and dissected uplands. Slopes are mainly 8 to 16 percent.",

These soils formed in thick gravelly and stony igneous alluvium, as dissected fans or terraces presumed to be of Quaternary of Pliocene Age.  The climate is arid to semiarid continental.  The average annual temperature is about 60 degrees to 68 degrees F., the average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches, and Thornthwaite P-E indices about 12 to 22."

Delnorte soils lack a mollic epipedon and Bt horizon.  Limpia and Reakor soils have sola thicker than 20 inches.  Vieja soils are more clayey and have formed in clayey shale."
