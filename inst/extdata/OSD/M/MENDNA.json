  "OVERVIEW": "The Mendna series consists of very poorly and poorly drained soils formed in a thick organic mat over loamy lacustrine nearshore deposits. Permafrost occurs at a depth of 2 to 39 inches below the mineral soil surface.  Mendna soils are on lacustrine terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

Depth to permafrost ranges from 2 to 39 inches below the surface of the mineral soil two months after the summer solstice.   There is more than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent and includes subangular pebbles and cobbles.  Reaction throughout the mineral profile is moderately acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizons have moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or 5GY;  moist value of 3 through 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features include redox concentrations and depletions; redox concentrations have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist chroma of 4 through 6; redox depletions have hue of 5Y or 5GY; moist value of 4 or 5; moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent subangular gravel and cobble.  A lag concentrate of coarse fragments is common along the surface of these horizons.\nThe C horizons have moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent subangular gravel and cobble.\nThe Cf horizon has moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Textures include loam, clay loam, silt loam and silty clay loam.  Clay content often increases with depth.  Coarse fragment\ncontent ranges from 0 to 30 percent and includes subangular gravel and cobble."

The profile is saturated and free water occurs above the permafrost.  Altered drainage occurs where the insulating organic mat is\ndestroyed by fire or clearing. Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafrost level and subsequent lowering of the water table."
