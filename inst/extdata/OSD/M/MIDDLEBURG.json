    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more. Depth to a lithologic discontinuity, when present, ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and 0 to 20 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through moderately acid in the solum, unless limed, and from very slightly acid through neutral in the substratum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon, where present has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  Texture is variable ranging from loam to silty clay and occasionally clay in the fine-earth fraction."

Bolton soils have rock fragments of chert.  Wheeling soils have yellowed Bt horizons.  Culleoka, Oatlands, Panorama and Spriggs soils have bedrock and/or Cr horizons within 60 inches.  Hayter soils have more than 35 percent sand in the B horizon.  Myersville soils have sola less than 40 inches thick.  Manassas soils have mottles within 40 inches.  Dumfries soils are formed in feldspathic Coastal Plain sediments.  Sudley soils contain rock fragments of Triassic sandstone and conglomerate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Middleburg soils are in upland swales, saddles, and in heads of drainageways. Drainageways are subject to frequent, extremely brief, flash flooding events with little or no deposition or erosion. Slope gradient commonly ranges from 1 to 4 percent but may be as high as 15 percent.  The soils formed in loamy colluvium and local alluvium overlying mixed basic and acid Blue Ridge rocks.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degree F and mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."
