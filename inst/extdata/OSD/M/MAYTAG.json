  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 45 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to soft chalk or marl is more than 60 inches.  Intersecting slickensides are at a depth of 10 to 40 inches.  Content of calcium carbonate nodules and soft accumulations ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon, from 5 to 25 percent in the upper part of the solum and more than 20 percent in the lower part of the solum and substratum. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the Ap horizon, from neutral to moderately alkaline in the AB horizon, neutral in the Bk or Bkss horizons and slightly or moderately alkaline in the BCk, CBk and C horizons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 1OYR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe AB horizon, present in most pedons, or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay or silty clay.\nThe upper part of the Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe lower part of the Bk has the same range of colors and textures as the upper part. Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, olive or gray range from few to many. Some pedons have no dominant color and are mottled in shades of yellow, brown, olive or gray.\nThe Bkss horizon, where present, has the same range of colors and textures as the lower part of the Bk horizon.\nThe BCk, CBk or C horizons, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Mottles in shade of yellow, brown, olive or gray range from common to many. In some pedons, there is no dominant color and it is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, olive or gray.  Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Garner, Hollywood, Kaman, Okolona and Zilaboy in the same family.  The moderately well drained Garner soils formed in Pleistocene-age deposits on terrace positions along the Trinity river in Texas in the Western Coastal Plain (MLRA 133B). The moderately well drained Hollywood soils are in Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valleys (MLRA 128).  The poorly drained Kaman soils are on flood plains of the Gulf Coast Prairies (MLRA 150) and Western Gulf Flatwoods (MLRA 1522B).  Okolona soils are on less sloping areas and have a Mollic epipedon. The moderately well drained Zilaboy soils are on flood plains of Texas in  the Texas Blackland Prairies, Northern; (867A) and Texas Claypan, Southern (MLRA 87A) Major Land Resource Areas."

Maytag soils are formed in residuum weathered from marl or chalk.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is 65 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 50 inches."

The Binnsville, Demopolis, and Watsonia soils have sola less than 20 inches thick to chalk.  The somewhat poorly drained Kipling and the moderately well drained Oktibbeha soils have acid upper subsoils.  In addition, Oktibbeha soils have redder upper subsoils.  Sumter soils have a fine-silty control section and carbonatic mineralogy.  The somewhat poorly drained Vaiden soils are on less sloping areas, have acid subsoils and have more clay in the control section."
