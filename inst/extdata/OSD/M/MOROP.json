  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Base saturation ranges from 80 to 100 percent.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 50 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate ranges from 20 to 50 inches, but occurs in or immediately below the solum if the solum is thicker than 40 inches.  Rock fragments average from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part of the B horizon and from 35 to 65 percent in the lower part of the B and C horizon above a depth of 50 inches and are mainly 10 to 30 inches in diameter.  Sand and silt fractions contain about 2 to 20 or more percent of dark colored ferromagnesian rich minerals and fragments of basalt.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 65 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It commonly is heavy clay loam or clay in the fine earth fraction and modified with stones, but it ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt, and 15 to 55 percent sand with less than 15 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is loam or clay modified by stones, and has less than 35 percent clay.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and has 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ethridge, Holderness, Scobey, and Tanna series.  Ethridge soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments, most of which are less than 10 inches in diameter and have accumulated carbonates at a depth of 10 to 20 inches.  Holderness soils are noncalcareous to a depth of more than 40 inches and are not calcareous immediately below the solum if it is thicker than 40 inches, lack continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation, and have less than 15 percent coarse fragments most of which are less than 10 inches in diameter.  Scobey soils contain fewer than 20 percent coarse fragments most of which are less than 10 inches in diameter and are calcareous at a depth of 10 to 18 inches.  Tanna soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Morop soils are on alluvial fans, high terraces, and valley-filling sides slopes.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in transported sediments derived primarily from basalt and have a high percentage of dark ferromagnesian mineral grains in the sand and silt fractions.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 61 degrees F."

Scattered Gambel oak is common."
