Elevation ranges from near sea level to 380 meters (1,250 feet). They formed in residuum weathered from basic igneous rock, volcanic ash and some tropospheric dust.  The median annual rainfall ranges from 610 to 1,143 millimeters (24 to 45 inches), three-fourths of this falling from October through March.  Mean annual PAN evaporation is 2,413 Millimeters (95 inches.)  The mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.) Average January temperature is 22 degrees C. (71 degrees F.) and the average July temperature is 26 degrees C. (78 degrees F.)"

Also, Mica is high until 91 centimeters (36 inches) and layer below is too thin, therefore no oxic horizon.\nAridic moisture regime, bordering on ustic.\nFCC Classification: Cd+i-k.\nEdit Log: 12/19 MK. Horizon designations, landform and landscape, competing series, and minor changes made.\n5/04 SN. Horizon designations updated and minor changes made.\n8/00 SN. Classification changed from Fine, kaolinitic, isohyperthermic Oxic Haplustolls due to changes in Taxonomy.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL Makaweli sample S62HI-007-002 (formerly S62Ha-2-2) and S62HI007-003 (formerly S62Ha-2-3).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
