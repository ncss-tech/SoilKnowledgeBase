When described on July 15, 1991, the soil was moist throughout.)\nOi--0 to 1 inch; slightly decomposed mat of needles, leaves, twigs, roots and moss. A thin discontinuous lense of Mount St Helens ash is at the boundary between the Oi and the A1 horizon.\nA1--1 to 4 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) medial silt loam, brown (10YR 5/3) dry; moderate very fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; weakly smeary; many very fine, fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 15 percent 1 to 5 mm iron-manganese concretions; 5 percent basalt gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.6); clear smooth boundary.\nA2--4 to 13 inches; dark brown (7.5YR 3/3) medial silt loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) dry; moderate very fine and fine subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, very friable, slightly sticky and slightly plastic; weakly smeary; many very fine, common fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine irregular pores; 10 percent 1 to 5 mm iron-manganese concretions; 2 percent basalt gravel; very strongly acid (pH 4.8); clear smooth boundary. (Combined thickness of the A horizon is 10 to 20 inches.)\nBw--13 to 25 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) silty clay loam, yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) dry; moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure; slightly hard, friable, moderately sticky and slightly plastic; common very fine, few fine and medium roots; many very fine and fine tubular pores; 5 percent siltstone paragravel; 2 percent basalt gravel; very strongly acid (pH 5.0); clear wavy boundary.

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry less than 45 consecutive days between the depths of 4 and 12 inches following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The upper 3 to 7 inches of the epipedon has ammonium-acetate extractable Al + Fe of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, and 15-bar moisture of more than 15 percent. The lower part to a depth of 20 inches has ammonium-acetate extractable Al + Fe of 1.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.0 g/cc. Andic soil properties, when present, do not extend beyond 14 inches. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 34 percent clay and has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry. The A1 horizon is medial silt loam and the A2 horizon is silt loam or medial silt loam. The A horizon has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 25 percent paragravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist or dry. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 18 to 34 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 60 percent paragravel."

If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
