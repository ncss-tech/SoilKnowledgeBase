  "OVERVIEW": "The Mutt series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium dominantly from sedimentary rock. Mutt soils formed on ridgetops and old slumps of mountains. Slopes are 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 105 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The upper 3 to 7 inches of the epipedon has ammonium-acetate extractable Al + Fe of 2.0 to 3.0 percent, a moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, phosphate retention of more than 85 percent, and 15-bar moisture of more than 15 percent. The lower part to a depth of 20 inches has ammonium-acetate extractable Al + Fe of 1.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.0 g/cc. Andic soil properties, when present, do not extend beyond 14 inches. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 34 percent clay and has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry. The A1 horizon is medial silt loam and the A2 horizon is silt loam or medial silt loam. The A horizon has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 25 percent paragravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist or dry. It is silt loam or silty clay loam and has 18 to 34 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 60 percent paragravel."

If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties."
