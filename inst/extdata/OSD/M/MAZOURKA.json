  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The particle-size control section of the Mazourka series is the natric horizon.  While the Btn horizon may have up to 30 percent clay content the BAtn and BCtn horizons, which are also in the particle-size control section, have less than 18 percent clay content.  The particle-size control section therefore averages 12 to 18 percent clay content (coarse-loamy).\nDiagnostics horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The surface 3 cm of the soil (A horizon).\nNatric horizon - The zone from about 3 to 43 cm (2BAtn, 2Btn and 2BCtn horizons).\nCoarse-loamy family - The particle-size control section has 16 percent clay content.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
