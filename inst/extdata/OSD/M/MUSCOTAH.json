  "OVERVIEW": "The Muscotah series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium. Muscotah soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters, and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (53 degrees F).",

There are many supporting profile descriptions with slickensides.  This soil has not been changed to a vertisol because the upper 18 centimeters for most pedons is less than 30 percent clay.\n11/2008 JCR expanded seasonal saturation to January through June based on observations of field soil scientists."
