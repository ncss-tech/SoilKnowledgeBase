    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 25 to 102 centimeters. (A1, A2, Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: The zone from 0 to 178 centimeters. (All A, Bw horizons)\nRedoximorphic concentrations: In the zone from 41 to 112 centimeters. (A2, Bw1, Bw2 horizons)\nRedoximorphic depletions: In the zone from 112 to 178 centimeters. (Bw3, Bw4 horizons)\nEndosaturation: The zone of saturation > 46 centimeters. (A2 through Bg horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: These soils were originally mapped as Wabash in the original\nBrown County survey. These soils are better drained than Wabash soils. The name was changed from the proposed Powhattan series. A complete pedon analysis is available from NSSL as pedon number S90-KS-013-008. ]\n9/2008 GJJ added metric conversions, removed English units, and made some format\nchanges.\n10/2008 JCR Changed the taxonomic nomenclature from Bw and Bg to Bss and Bgss as\nslickensides were identified in the typical pedon.  There are many supporting profile descriptions with slickensides.  This soil has not been changed to a vertisol because the upper 18 centimeters for most pedons is less than 30 percent clay.\n11/2008 JCR expanded seasonal saturation to January through June based on observations of field soil scientists.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
