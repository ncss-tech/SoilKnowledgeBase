Millstone was established to correlate for Wheeling soils that have a slightly lower base status and were not considered a probable source of sand and gravel.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data on pedon number S93-IN123-006 (typical pedon), and S91-IN123-102 is on file at the NSSC, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
