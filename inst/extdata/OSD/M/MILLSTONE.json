The moderately well drained Sciotoville and the somewhat poorly drained Hatfield soils are on slightly lower lying treads of stream terraces and lower lying flood plain-steps."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic surface and subsurface horizons recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon- the zone 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 inches) (Ap horizon); 2) Argillic horizon- the zone 30 to 203 cm (12 to 80 inches) (Bt horizons).\nThis soil is included in mapping with the Wheeling soils in previous Indiana Soil Surveys. Millstone was established to correlate for Wheeling soils that have a slightly lower base status and were not considered a probable source of sand and gravel.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data on pedon number S93-IN123-006 (typical pedon), and S91-IN123-102 is on file at the NSSC, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
