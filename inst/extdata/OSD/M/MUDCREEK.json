  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudcreek series consists of moderately deep to dense till, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium from alpine glacial till deposits on ground moraines on till plains. Slopes are 5 to 35 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 130 inches and average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
