The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to dense till has andic soil properties with moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 20 to 35 percent for air dried samples. Acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent. It has 2 to 3 cmol/kg of aluminum. The particle-size control section has 8 to 18 percent field estimated clay and averages 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.
