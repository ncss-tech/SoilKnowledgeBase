  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series. The Biddeford, Roundhead, and Toledo soils are in closely related families. Biddeford soils have a frigid temperature regime and do not have carbonates in the upper part of the series control section. Roundhead soils are fine-silty. Toledo soils do not have a histic epipedon and do not have carbonates in the upper part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McGuffey soils typically are on broad, nearly level areas or in depressions associated with glacial lakes of Wisconsinan age. The slope gradient is less than 1 percent. The soils formed in organic plant material in former marshes and bogs and partly in calcareous lacustrine deposits in most areas. However, drainage of the marshes, subsidence, and loss of surface has nearly depleted the organic soil. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 940 mm (33 to 37 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 11 degrees C (49 to 51 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carlisle, Linwood, Milford, Montgomery, Roundhead, and Willette soils. Carlisle, Linwood, and Willette soils are Histosols and have surface layers of sapric material more than 41 cm (16 inches) thick. Carlisle soils are in the deepest part of the lake basin or at the upper end of shallow drainage systems where organic materials have accumulated to the greatest depth; whereas, Linwood and Willette soils are in landscape positions between McGuffey and Carlisle soils. Milford and Montgomery soils are very poorly drained mineral soils that have a mollic epipedon but lack the overlying organic materials. They are on the perimeter of the lake plains. Roundhead soils have less clay in the underlying lacustrine deposits but are in similar landscape positions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic material and moderately low or low in the lacustrine deposits. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the organic material and slow or very slow in the lacustrine deposits."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: McGuffey soils are cultivated. Corn and soybeans are now the principal crops, although extensive areas were formerly used for truck crops, mostly onions and potatoes. Native vegetation is wet prairie grasses, reeds, and sedges with some shrubs and scattered hardwoods."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The McGuffey soils were originally identified as Willette, but with continued subsidence and loss of surface, these soils no longer qualify as Histosols. These soils are considered prime farmland because very slow permeability is restricted to the C horizon of some pedons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nHistic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 25 cm (Op horizon).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 25 to 84 cm (Bg horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory is available for HD-22, the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
