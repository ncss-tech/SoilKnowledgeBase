  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Typically the underlying granite is weathered (disintegrated) to a depth greater than 60 inches, but in some pedons, the bedrock is unweathered within depths of 40 to 60 inches.  The unweathered bedrock is recognized as a bedrock phase.  Typically, these soils have a loess mantle 15 to 35 inches thick overlying the till or residuum weathered from granitic rock (grus).  The bedrock phase lacks the loess mantle.  The solum, at depths below the influence of agricultural lime, is slightly acid to very strongly acid.  The 2C horizon is slightly acid to strongly acid.  Volume of angular pebbles in that part of the solum formed in the upper silty or loamy deposits ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  In that part of the solum formed in till or residuum angular pebbles range from 30 to 75 percent by volume.  In the 2C horizon, the volume of angular pebbles ranges from 15 to 90 percent.  See the REMARKS section for a discussion on the character of the coarse fragments.  Volume of cobbles or stones ranges from 0 to 2 percent in the loess and from 0 to 8 percent in the residuum, but in some places stony phases are recognized.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The lower value colors are typical of the A horizon that ranges from 2 to 5 inches thick.  It is silt loam or loam.  In some pedons, below the Ap or A horizon, there is a horizon with high chroma colors similar to those of a spodic horizon, but it is too thin or does not meet the chemical requirements of a spodic horizon.\nThe E horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Marathon soils have E/B or B/E horizons, or both.  These horizons have tongues of E material surrounding thin, column-like upward extensions of the Bt horizon or wholly surrounding small, isolated remnants of the Bt horizon.  The tongues of E material have colors like the E horizon and are silt loam marginal to silt but in some pedons, grade with depth to very fine sandy loam or loam.  The Bt part of the horizon has 7.5YR or 10YR hue, and value and chroma of 3 to 5.  Typically, it is silt loam, but in some pedons it is very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bt1 horizon has 7.5YR or 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  Clay films are thin and few to many on faces of peds in the Bt horizons.  The control section averages between 10 and 18 percent clay and from 30 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser.  Some pedons contain mottles in the argillic horizon. The 2Bt2 horizon differs from the overlying 2Bt1 horizon mainly in having coarser texture, fewer clay films, and higher gravel content.\nThe 2C horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, and 5YR hue; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 8.  It consists of grus, an accumulation of waste consisting of angular, coarse-grained fragments resulting from the granular disintegration of crystalline rocks (esp. granite).  The pebble and cobble size fragments crush to sand size material without much difficulty."

The pebble size fragments, in place, behave as gravel in-so-far as the bulk density, permeability, and available water are concerned.  As a construction material the pebble size fragments crush to sand and silt size material.  The logical UNIFIED classification is SM or SP.  The pebble size fragments are not suitable for aggregate so it is not a probable source of sand or gravel.\nDiagnostic horizons recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 15 inches (Ap, E, E/B); argillic horizon - from 18 to 38 inches (B/E and 2Bt1).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to soil number S70WI-37-3, National Soil Survey Laboratory numbers 70L883-70L893 for some data on typifying pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
