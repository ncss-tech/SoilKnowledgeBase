  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness, depth to bedrock, and thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 34 inches.  The soil cracks when dry and the COLE of the argillic horizon ranges from .07 to .09.  However, the potential linear extensibility is less than 2.4 inches or the soil lacks an argillic horizon 20 inches or more thick.\nThe A horizon has colors in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is a clay loam or silty clay loam.  The reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has colors in hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is a clay loam, clay, or silty clay with clay content of 35 to 55 percent.  The reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline and it is calcareous in the lower part of most pedons.  Concretions or soft masses of calcium carbonate range from none to a few.  Some pedons contain a few limestone fragments, mainly less than 3 inches across, in the lower part.\nThe R layer is coarsely fractured limestone that is interbedded with marly and clayey soil materials at vertical intervals of 4 to about 10 inches.  The limestone has a hardness of 3 to 5 on Mohs scale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in this family.  Competing soils in similar families include the Abilene, Blanket, Brewer, Caradan, Crawford, Dalco, Lindy, and San Saba series.  Abilene, Blanket, and Brewer soils lack a contact with limestone bedrock within 40 inches of the surface.  Caradan and Lindy soils lack mollic epipedons.  Dalco and San Saba soils lack argillic horizons and have well expressed vertic properties."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mingo soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent but are mainly 1 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in limestone and marine clay of Lower Cretaceous Formations.  The climate is warm subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 26 to 34 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 62 to 69 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E indices are 44 to 56."

Sanger soils are calcareous, lack Bt horizons, and have intersecting slickensides.  Somervell soils lack Bt horizons and have less than 35 percent clay in the control section."
