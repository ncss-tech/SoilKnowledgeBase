  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Montsweet series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively to well drained soils that formed in eolian sands over residuum weathered from sandstone.  These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 15 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
