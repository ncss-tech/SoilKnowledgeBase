Colita soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Derly, Evadale, and Wrightsville soils have a fine textured control section. Gessner soils have a coarse-loamy control section. Lelavale soils are in closed depressions, are ponded from October through June in normal years, and are in a semiactive activity class. Mollco soils are ponded for more than 4 months in normal years and are in a superactive activity class. Vimville soils have a glossic horizon that extends to more than 60 inches deep and they do not have a substratum with less than 15 percent clay. Waller soils have an albic horizon more than 14 inches thick, and an ochric epipedon more than 20 inches thick."

Slopes are less than 1 percent with a plain or concave surface. The soils formed in sandy and loamy alluvial sediments. The surfaces typically have been reworked by wind. The climate is humid temperate. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 56 inches, mean annual temperature is from 64 to 68 degrees F., frost free days range from 220 to 260, the elevation ranges from 150 to 450 feet above sea level, and Thornthwaite P-E index exceeds 64."

Besner and Cart soils are on adjoining mounds and are well drained. Bienville, Latch, and Hainesville soils are on slightly higher terrace positions adjoining low ridges or mounds, and they have a sandy surface layer. Bonn and Verdun soils are on similar positions and have a natric horizon. Derly and Wrightsville soils are on similar positions and have a fine textured control section. Spurger soils are on similar positions, are moderately well drained, and have a clayey control section."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Mollville soils that are on the Sabine River Terrace, mainly on the first or second terrace level, have a sandy 2C horizon. Mollville soils on third and higher level terraces, and on some other terrace systems in the western parts of MLRA 133B typically have a loamy subsoil to a depth of 80 inches. A loamy substratum phase was recognized for the soils that do not have a sandy 2C horizon. It was decided in 2002 that a separate series (Vimville?) is needed for the loamy substratum phase for all future updates in MLRA 133B. The allowance for loamy textures with up to 35 percent clay in the 2C horizon was removed from the Mollville series range in characteristics in 2002.  The series was updated in 2004 to allow redox features in the Eg horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon -- 0 to 11 inches (A and Eg horizons).\nAlbic horizon ---- 5 to 11 inches (Eg horizon).\nGlossic horizon -- 11 to 23 inches (Btg/E1 horizon).\nArgillic horizon - 11 to 54 inches (Btg/E, Btg, and BCtg horizons).\nIntrusions of albic material - 11 to 47 inches (Btg/E and Btg horizons)."
