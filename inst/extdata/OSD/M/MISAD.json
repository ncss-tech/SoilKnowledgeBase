    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Misad soils are on alluvial fans, fan skirts, inset fans and offshore bars.  These soils formed in alluvium or lake sediments derived from mixed rock sources with some influence from loess high in volcanic ash.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,830 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The climate is cool, semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 130 to 200 mm; mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
