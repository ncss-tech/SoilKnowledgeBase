  "REVDATE": "03/2016",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Misad series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or lake sediments derived from mixed rocks with some influence from loess high in volcanic ash.  Misad soils occur on alluvial fans, fan skirts, inset fans and offshore bars. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
