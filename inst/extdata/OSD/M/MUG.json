  "OVERVIEW": "The Mug series consists of soils that are well drained and moderately deep soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from welded tuff. They are on terraces, basalt plains, and foothills.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 8.3 degrees C.",
