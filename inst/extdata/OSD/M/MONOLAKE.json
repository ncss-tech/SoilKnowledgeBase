  "OVERVIEW": "The Monolake series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite and tuff breccia with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Monolake soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite and tuff breccia with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 2,700 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."
