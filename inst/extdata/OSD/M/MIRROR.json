  "OVERVIEW": "The Mirror series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in very stony colluvial material weathered from igneous rocks.  Mirror soils are on alpine ridges and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and mean annual temperature is about 30 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon: the zone from 1 to 9 inches (A horizon)\nLithic contact: monzonite bedrock at 31 inches (R horizon)\nCambic horizon: the zone from 9 to 23 inches (Bw1, Bw2)\nThe classification in 1987 was loamy-skeletal, mixed Pergelic Cryumbrepts. The classification in 1966 was loamy-skeletal, mixed, Typic Cryorthods\nThe revision of May 2007 updated the taxonomic class from Humic Dystrocryepts is based on the tenth edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2006.\nThe type location needs to be moved to a location that has the type location in a published manuscript. With the base of the cambic at 23 inches the epipedon meets the thickness criterion for an umbric. However, the layer designated as a C horizon seems to meet the criteria for a cambic. If so, then the umbric epipedon is too thin. A more representative pedon was not available to better reflect the umbric epipedon thickness."
