  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this soil are a C horizon from the surface to 1 inch (Mt. St. Helens volcanic ash `W' layer 450 years B.P.) a cambic horizon from 6 to 14 inches formed in volcanic ash over dense glacial till from 33 to 62 inches.  The particle-size control section is the zone from 12 to 33 inches (part of the 2Bw and 3CB horizons).  The zone from 12 to 14 inches is ashy and the zone from 14 to 33 inches is loamy-skeletal.  The ashy part is only 2 inches thick, thus the soil does not have a contrasting particle-size class.  The thickest part is therefore used which is loamy-skeletal.  Andic properties from 3 to 14 inches.\nXeric soil moisture regime.\nAll depths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data available from NSSL, pedon numbers S94WA-047-004, S93WA-047-009, S97WA-047-006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
