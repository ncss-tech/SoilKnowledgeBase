  "OVERVIEW": "The Moscow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from granite, gneiss, and schist with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash. Moscow soils are on foot slopes, back slopes, and ridges of mountains with slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 24 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Soils with a similar Andic or Vitrandic Haploxerepts classification are the Aits, Canteen, Leadpoint, and Waits series.  Aits, Bercumb, Canteen, Moso, Roslyn, Smith, and Waits soils are very deep. Leadpoint soils are neutral or slightly alkaline and have 10 to 40 percent parachanners and 15 to 35 percent channers in the particle-size control section. Osborn soils have less than 5 percent hard rock fragments and average 20 to 50 percent sandstone parafragments in the particle-size control section. Volperie soils have 5 to 15 percent mica by weight in the fine-earth fraction, 5 to 20 percent quartz gravel and 30 to 60 percent phyllite and schist parafragments in the particle-size control section."

Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from granite, gneiss, and schist with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash. They are in a climate having relatively warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches. The average January temperature is about 28 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.

St. Helens 'T' or 'W' volcanic ash)\nCambic horizon  the zone from 1.75 inch to 15 inches\nParticle-size control section  the zone from 10 to 28 inches\nAndic feature  the zone from 1.5 to 15 inches\nThe type location for the series was moved to Stevens County, Washington due to the largest acreage extent.  Based on extensive re-evaluation within the Spokane County update soil survey, the Moscow series concept has not be recognized.\nThe vegetation listed within the OSD appears to vary from those species found in xeric to udic soil moisture regimes.  More investigation is needed as to the modal soil moisture concept and characteristic vegetation.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
