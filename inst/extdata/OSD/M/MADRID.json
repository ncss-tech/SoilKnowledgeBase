  "OVERVIEW": "The Madrid series consists of very deep, well drained soils. They formed in loamy deposits derived mainly from sandstone, limestone and granite on till plains and moraines. Permeability is moderate or moderately slow in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum. Slope ranges from 3 to 50 percent. Mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Redoximorphic features may be present below 40 inches in some pedons. Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent by volume in the surface and subsurface, from 5 to 30 percent in the subsoil and up to 40 percent in substratum.\nThe A and Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. They range from  fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate granular. They are friable or very friable.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, with value and chroma ranging from 3 through 6. Texture of the fine earth fraction ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam. Structure is weak granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak blocky, platy or granular structure or it is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2B/E, 2E/B, B/E or E/B horizon have properties like the Bt horizon in the interiors of the peds, and E-like material on the exterior of the ped. The B material has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate blocky or subangular blocky. Consistence is firm or friable in the B material and friable or very friable in the E material.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There is are no other members of this family. The Bombay, Lansing, Nellis, Ontario, Pittsfield, Stockbridge and Valois series are similar soils in related families. Bombay soils have  mottling within 30 inches of the surface. Lansing and Ontario soils have more clay in argillic horizons. Nellis, Pittsfield, Stockbridge, and Valois soils lack argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Madrid soils occupy undulating to steep land forms of moraines and till plains, commonly near the margins of, or within the areas occupied by, glacial lakes. Slope ranges from 3 to 50  percent. The regolith is till of mixed sandstone, limestone and granite origin, with or without contrasting water deposited surficial mantles or water-working of the till. The climate is humid temperate, average annual precipitation is 32 to 40 inches, average  annual air temperature is 44 degrees to 50 degrees F, and the frost-free season is 130 to 170 days."
