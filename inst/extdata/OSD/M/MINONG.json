  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock commonly is 23 to 38 centimeters (9 to 15 inches) but ranges from 10 to 50 centimeters (4 to 20 inches).  The organic portion commonly has pH of 5.0 to 6.5 in 0.01M CaCl2, but ranges from 4.5 to 7.7.  The pedon is very strongly acid to mildly alkaline.  Very thin mineral layers are at the interface in most pedons.  The broken face of the surface layer has hue of 10YR to 5YR, and value and chroma of 2 to 4, or is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  This layer is muck, mucky peat, and/or peat consisting primarily of conifer needles, deciduous leaves, and herbaceous fibers.  The subsurface layers have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  These layers are muck.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 30 percent and the volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly, cobbly, very gravelly, or very cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe bedrock is igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic."
