The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 53 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or redder, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or silt loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or redder, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam and averages 30 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent very soft weathered paragravel and 0 to 15 percent hard cobbles."

Bohannon soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Hembre and Wadell soils have over 15 percent hard rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Horeb and Preacher soils are very strongly acid.  Also, Horeb soils have mottles with chroma of 2 through 6 at depths of 24 to 36 inches.  Stevenson soils have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR.  Meda soils have sola 20 to 30 inches thick."
