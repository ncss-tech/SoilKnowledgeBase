  "OVERVIEW": "The Molalla series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from tuffs, breccias, and andesite.  Molalla soils are on uplands.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 53 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or redder, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or silt loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 5 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or redder, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam and averages 30 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent very soft weathered paragravel and 0 to 15 percent hard cobbles."
