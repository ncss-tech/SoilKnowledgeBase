Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and substratum.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The upper part of the solum ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid and the lower part is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The substratum ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A and E horizons are very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Skanee series in the same family and the closely related Belding, Charlevoix, Coral, Gaastra, and Richter series.  Skanee soils have coarser textured subsoils and have more acid substratums.  The Belding, Charlevoix, Coral, Gaastra, and Richter soils do not have fragipans.  In addition, Belding soils have more clay in the subsoil and substratum.  Coral, Gaastra and Richter soils have less clay in their subsoils.  Charlevoix soils are more acid."

The climate is continental, but affected by Lake Superior causing extra winter precipitation.  Mean annual precipitation is from 26 to 33 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F."
