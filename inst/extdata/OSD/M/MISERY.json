  "OVERVIEW": "The Misery series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glacial till on ground and end moraines and relict lake basins.  Permeability is moderate above the fragipan, very slow in the fragipan, and moderate or moderately slow in the lower part of the pedon.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and substratum.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The upper part of the solum ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid and the lower part is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The substratum ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.

Skanee soils have coarser textured subsoils and have more acid substratums.  The Belding, Charlevoix, Coral, Gaastra, and Richter soils do not have fragipans.  In addition, Belding soils have more clay in the subsoil and substratum.  Coral, Gaastra and Richter soils have less clay in their subsoils.  Charlevoix soils are more acid."
