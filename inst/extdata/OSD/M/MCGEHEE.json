  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 40 to 72 inches.  Depth to silty clay or clay horizons is 20 to 30 inches, and clay does not increase by 25 percent within a vertical distance of 5 inches.  The solum is usually medium acid or strongly acid, but in some pedons the IIB3 horizon is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.  The IIC horizon is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 or 3, and it is commonly mottled with colors of 1 through 4 chroma.  The A horizon is silt loam, loam or very fine sandy loam.  The B1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, and it is mottled with yellowish brown or strong brown.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The interiors of peds of the B21t horizon have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. The B21t horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The upper 20 inches of the B horizon averages 25 to 35 percent clay, and less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  In some pedons, the B21t horizon has silt sized grains on the faces of peds, but they are not continuous and do not form coatings.  The interiors of peds of the IIB3 horizon have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  In some pedons, the B3 horizon has few silt grains on faces of peds, but the grains do not form prominent coatings.  The IIC horizon has reddish brown and gray mottles and is silty clay or clay."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Acadia, Amagon, Askew, Cypremort, Dundee, Essen, Hebert, Hillemann, Patoutville, Patterson, Routon, and Tensas series.  Acadia and Tensas soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the B horizons.  Amagon and Routon soils have colors of 1 chroma or value of 6 and chroma of 2.  Askew soils have colors that are dominantly of 3 or higher chroma and lack lower chroma ped coatings.  Cypremort soils have hue yellower than 7.5YR, and coarser texture in the lower part of the sola.  Dundee soils have hue of 10YR and coarser texture in the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon.  Essen soils are mildly to moderately alkaline throughout the B horizons.  Hebert soils are silt loam or silty clay loam in the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon, and prominent silt coatings are on ped faces throughout the B horizons.  Hillemann soils have high sodium saturation in the lower part of the B horizon.  Patoutville soils have red mottles and lack clayey texture in the lower part of the B horizon.  Patterson soils have B horizons that contain less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The McGehee soils were formerly classified in the Gray-Brown Podzolic great soil group.  Classification as Ochraqualfs is based on gray ped coatings and seasonal high water table which seem to be more definitive of soil drainage than colors of the interiors of peds.  The alluvium in which these soils are formed is believed to be derived principally from Permian Red Beds.  These materials appear to retain their red colors even when subjected to a reducing environment.  Hence, color of ped interiors does not seem to reflect drainage conditions.\nOSED scanned by SSQA.
