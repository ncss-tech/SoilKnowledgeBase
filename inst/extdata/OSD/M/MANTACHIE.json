  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the profile, except for surface layers that have been limed.  Concretions and/or soft masses of iron and manganese oxides range from none to common throughout the profile.  Content of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent, by volume, throughout the profile.  Buried horizons, with colors and textures similar to those of the Bw or Bg horizons, occur in many pedons below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown or gray range from few to many. Some pedons do not have a dominant matrix color and are multicolored in shades of brown and gray.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon commonly lacks a dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of gray, brown, red, and yellow; or it has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, red, yellow or brown are few to many.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, gray or red range from few to many.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Cg or C horizon, where present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, gray or red range from few to many.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Thin strata ranging from sand to clay material occur in many pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mantachie soils are on flood plains of streams that drain areas of the Southern Coastal Plain.  They formed in loamy alluvium.  The climate is humid subtropical. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees Fahrenheit, and the mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bibb, Iuka, Jena, Kinston, Kirkville, Mimms, Mooreville, Ochlockonee and Riverview series.  All of these soils are on the nearly lineal surfaces of flood plains.  The poorly drained Bibb and Kinston soils are in depressed areas. In addition, Bibb soils have coarse-loamy control sections. The moderately well drained Iuka, Jena, Kirkville and Mooreville soils and the well-drained Ochlockonee and Riverview soils are on higher parts of natural levees.  The poorly drained Mimms soils are on lower depressional areas, have more clay in the control sections and are kaolinitic. Mooreville soils are moderately well drained.  In addition, Iuka, Kirkville and Ochlockonee soils have coarse-loamy control sections."

Some areas are in bottomland hardwoods or in loblolly or slash pine plantations.  Common trees are green ash, eastern cottonwood, cherrybark oak, water oak, willow oak, loblolly pine, sweetgum, and yellow-poplar."

The seasonal high water table ranges from 1.0 to 1.5 feet of the surface during periods of high rainfall.\nMantachie soils are in MLRA 133A.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data is available on the National Soil Survey website at: http://ncsslabdatamart.sc.egov.usda.gov/querypage.aspx\nLaboratory data was provided by Auburn University, Soil Characterization Laboratory, Auburn AL and the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE.\nLaboratory data for four pedons are from the Soil Genesis and Morphology Laboratory of the Mississippi Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station, Mississippi State, Mississippi.  Engineering test data for one pedon are published in Soil Survey of Lee County, Mississippi (issued March 1973) pp. 54-55.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
