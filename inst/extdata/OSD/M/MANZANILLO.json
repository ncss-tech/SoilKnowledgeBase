    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches. Most precipitation occurs as high intensity rain during afternoon thunderstorms from June to September. The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is 210 to 250 days."

Chilicotal soils do not have a petrocalcic horizon and are very deep to bedrock. Pantak soils have an argillic horizon that overlies a lithic contact. Paisano soils are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic layer and are not underlain by fanglomerate. Santera soils are very deep soils in drainageways."
