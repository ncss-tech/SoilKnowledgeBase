  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to permafrost ranges from 10 to 20 inches below the mineral surface.  Matrix colors in the C horizons are in hues of 2.5Y and 5Y, values of 4 and 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Large patches of slightly redder materials are common. Grayish mottles generally occur in the lower part of the profile but may also occur in the upper parts of the C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Goldstream, Kuskokwim, Owhat and Saulich series of the same family. All have lower chromas. The Goldstream series are formed in silty sediments that are fairly high in mica. The Kuskokwim soils are commonly strongly mottled. The Owhat soils have thick dark Al horizons. The Saulich series are formed in nonacid silty materials that are fairly high in mica."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Medfra soils occur on nearly level to moderately steep slopes of rounded hills. The regolith consists of deep to moderately deep silty loess and colluvium over shattered bedrock. The silty material is perennially frozen below a depth of 20 inches. The climate is subarctic continental with long cold winters and short warm summers. Mean annual air temperature is about 26 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Kuskokwim series, and the Telida and McGrath series. The Telida soils have thin 0 horizons and are not perennially frozen. The McGrath soils are well drained and have a spodic horizon."
