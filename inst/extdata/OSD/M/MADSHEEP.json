  "OVERVIEW": "The Madsheep series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum of red noncalcareous shale, siltstone, and sandstone on mountain summits, shoulders and side slopes. Permeability is moderately rapid. Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Skytop soils are formed in glacial till derived primarily from gray and brown quartzite, conglomerate and sandstone. Paddyknob soils have hue yellowier than 5YR, have less silt, and are dominantly formed in sandstone. Mandy soils have hues yellowier than 5YR in the Bw, and have mixed mineralogy."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 80 percent. Climate is humid continental. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches, and is evenly distributed throughout the year, and frost free days range from 90 to 130 days."
