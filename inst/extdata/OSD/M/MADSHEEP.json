The particle-size control section average is 12 to 25 percent clay. Channers, flagstones, and cobbles of shale, siltstone, or sandstone range from 0 to 35 percent in the A and Ap horizons, from 20 to 55 percent in the BA and Bw horizons, and from 45 to 80 percent in the BC and C horizons. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loam or silt loam.\nSome pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Skytop series is the only other series in this family. The Paddyknob and Mandy soils are in closely related families. Skytop soils are formed in glacial till derived primarily from gray and brown quartzite, conglomerate and sandstone. Paddyknob soils have hue yellowier than 5YR, have less silt, and are dominantly formed in sandstone. Mandy soils have hues yellowier than 5YR in the Bw, and have mixed mineralogy."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 80 percent. Climate is humid continental. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches, and is evenly distributed throughout the year, and frost free days range from 90 to 130 days."
