  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Monjeau series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to weathered bedrock.  Monjeau soils formed in material weathered from andesite, sandstone, siltstone, or shale.  These soils are on hills and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The change is due to an increase of 15 percent clay (absolute) within 2.5 cm of the upper boundary of the argillic horizon, and the current concepts of soil moisture regimes in New Mexico."
