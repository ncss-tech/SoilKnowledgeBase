  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Merton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 35 to 60 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying calcareous, loamy glacial till.  These soils are on linear and slightly convex slopes on ground moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters.",
