The particle-size control section contains less than 60 percent vitric volcanic ash.  The umbric epipedon is 24 to 34 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 degrees to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, chroma of 1 to 3 moist or dry.  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is strongly acid to neutral."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Mossyrock soils occur in a marine type climate with 55 to 70 inches average annual precipitation occurring mostly as rain during the winter.  Mean January temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F., mean July temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 150 to 200 days."
