The particle-size control section contains less than 60 percent vitric volcanic ash.  The umbric epipedon is 24 to 34 inches thick.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 degrees to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, chroma of 1 to 3 moist or dry.  It has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is strongly acid to neutral."
