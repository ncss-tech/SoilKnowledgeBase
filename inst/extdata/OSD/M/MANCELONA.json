  "OVERVIEW": "The Mancelona series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly outwash on moraines, outwash plains, lake plains, deltas, eskers, stream terraces, kame moraines, and old beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
