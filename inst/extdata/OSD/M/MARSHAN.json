  "OVERVIEW": "The Marshan series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loamy sediments and the underlying sandy and gravelly outwash.  Marshan soils are on plane or slightly concave positions along narrow drainageways on outwash plains, valley trains, and stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 800 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
