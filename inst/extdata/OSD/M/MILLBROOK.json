  "OVERVIEW": "The Millbrook series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy stratified outwash. These soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 860 mm (34 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
