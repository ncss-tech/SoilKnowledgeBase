The poorly drained Drummer soils and the well drained Harvard soils form a drainage sequence with Millbrook soils. Drummer soils are on lower parts of the landscape and Harvard soils are on adjoining higher elevations. The poorly drained Sexton soils form a drainage sequence with Millbrook soils near forested areas and are on lower parts of the landscape."
