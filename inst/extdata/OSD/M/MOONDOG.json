They are usually dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 50 to 65 days during the 120 days following June 21.  The moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nDepth to the paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Clay content averages 27 to 35 percent and rock fragment content is 35 to 70 percent in the particle-size control section. The soil is calcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, extremely channery loam or very stony silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam, and less commonly sandy clay loam with 15 to 50 percent rock fragments in the upper part and greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the horizon. Rock fragments are dominantly gravels, channers and cobbles. This horizon is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline."

These soils formed in colluvium, residuum and alluvium derived dominantly from shale, siltstone and limestone. Thin strata of interbedded sandstone are present in some areas. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches. The freeze-free period is 90 to 110 days."
