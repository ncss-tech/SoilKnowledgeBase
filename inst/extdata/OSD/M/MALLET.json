  "OVERVIEW": "The Mallet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from in mixed alluvium.  Mallet soils are on stream terraces, fan remnants, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
