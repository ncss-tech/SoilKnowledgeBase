Lowered bottom depth of depth to redox concentrations from 97 centimeters to 125 centimeters to fit type location.  Lowered particle size control section clay content to 20 percent from 27 percent to fit the type location textures and what has been populated in NASIS. Added clay and sand percentages to range of characteristics horizon data.  Updated competing series and geographically associated soils. Expanded the range of Frost Free Days from 150 to 180 days, Mean Annual Precipitation from 710 millimeters to 750 millimeters, Mean Annual Air Temperature from 11 degrees C to 12 degrees C, and Elevation from 610 meters to 450 meters. Added saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Added occasional to flooding frequency.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
