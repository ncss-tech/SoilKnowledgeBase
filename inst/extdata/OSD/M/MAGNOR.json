    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of fine sand or coarser averages 15 to 70 percent. The base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 60 percent in some part of the argillic horizon. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle and from 5 to 35 percent in the till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the till. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 3 percent in the till. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the solum, except that it ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the till. Redox concentrations are typically throughout the pedon below the Ap or A horizon. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic and aquic conditions occur there at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon, 6 to 9 inches thick, with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Ap horizons with color value moist of 3 have value dry of 6 or more.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nMagnor soils have a glossic horizon. Horizonation has a wide range depending on thickness of the silty mantle and the extent to which eluviation has occurred. Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizon has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above. Some pedons have a Btg horizon, with dominant chroma of 2, below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The 2E part is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs, but in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand. The 2Bt part has color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described below.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.90. Some pedons have pockets or thin strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a 2BCd horizon with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogs. Clay content averages more than 7 percent. Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0. Some pedons have pockets or strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogs. Clay content averages more than 7 percent. Bulk density ranges from 1.8 to 2.0. Some pedons have pockets or thin strata of loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand."
