  "OVERVIEW": "The Minatare series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils.  They formed mainly in loamy and clayey alluvium on flood plains.  The soil material is strongly or very strongly affected by sodium and commonly by excess soluble salts. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 15 inches at the type location.",

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Minatare is the only series in the family.  Similar soils in closely related families are the Arvada, Janise, Jankosh, Napa, Saltine, and Zoe soils. Arvada soils are better drained and are in the montmorillonitic minerology class.  Janise and Jankosh soils are coarse-silty.  Napa soils are poorly drained, have a mollic epipedon, and are in an area of greater precipitation.  Saltine soils are fine-silty and do not have an argillic horizon.  Zoe soils are in the montmorillonitic minerology class and do not have an argillic horizon."
