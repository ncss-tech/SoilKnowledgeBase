    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 38 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 0 to 8 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is typically silt loam with the range including loam, very  fine sandy loam, and fine sandy loam.  Where the soil has been cultivated, it commonly has a calcareous clay loam Ap horizon. Reaction ranges from slightly to very strongly alkaline.  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 0 to 9.  Electrical conductivity (mmhos/cm) is less than 2.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and 3 through 5 moist, with chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam,  silty clay, or clay averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.  The sodium absorption ratio is 13 or more and the exchangeable sodium percentage is 15 or more.  Electrical conductivity ranges from 4 to 30.\nThe Bkn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is typically clay loam with the range including loam, silty clay loam, and sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have a C horizon.  Sodium adsorption ratio is 13 or more and exchangeable sodium percentage is 15 or more.  Reaction is strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon is a gleyed layer with hue of 5Y or other gleyed colors.   The texture ranges from gravelly coarse sandy loam to silt loam.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe lower 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 5 through 8 and 6 through 7 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4.  Colors are those of the minerals in the sands and gravels.  The texture is typically very gravelly coarse sand with the range including coarse sand and gravelly coarse sand.  Thin strata of loamy sand and sand are in some pedons.  In places, silty, loamy, and clayey alluvium is at a depth of 40 to below 60 inches.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Minatare is the only series in the family.  Similar soils in closely related families are the Arvada, Janise, Jankosh, Napa, Saltine, and Zoe soils. Arvada soils are better drained and are in the montmorillonitic minerology class.  Janise and Jankosh soils are coarse-silty.  Napa soils are poorly drained, have a mollic epipedon, and are in an area of greater precipitation.  Saltine soils are fine-silty and do not have an argillic horizon.  Zoe soils are in the montmorillonitic minerology class and do not have an argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Minatare soils are on flood plains.  They formed in loamy and clayey textured alluvium containing much sodium and in places, soluble salts.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F."

Gering and McGrew soils do not have an argillic horizon and contain less sodium.  In addition, Gering soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal and McGrew soils are coarse-loamy.  Yockey soils are coarse-silty."

During midsummer it commonly recedes to a depth of 3 to 5 feet.  (See Remarks). Flooding is rare or occasional and for brief durations."
