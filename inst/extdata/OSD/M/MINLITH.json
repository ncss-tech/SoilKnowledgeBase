  "OVERVIEW": "The Minlith series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian material overlying basalt.  Minlith soils are on uplands with slopes 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
