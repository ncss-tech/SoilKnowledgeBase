Basaltic and andesite bedrock underlies this soil.  Elevation is 2,400 to 3,200 feet.  The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Barbermill soils are shallow to a paralithic contact, lack secondary carbonates, and are found on adjacent south slopes.  Meadowridge soils are very deep to bedrock, and fine-loamy.  Simas soils are very deep to bedrock and are found on nearby hills which formed in tuffaceous sediments."
