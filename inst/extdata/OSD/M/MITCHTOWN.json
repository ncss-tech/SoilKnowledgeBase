  "OVERVIEW": "The Mitchtown series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over clayey sediments underlain by andesite bedrock.  They are on north-facing mountain side slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
