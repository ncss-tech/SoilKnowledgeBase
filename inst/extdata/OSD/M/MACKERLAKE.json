  "OVERVIEW": "The Mackerlake series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits deposited from mixed sources.  Mackerlake soils are on lake plains and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
