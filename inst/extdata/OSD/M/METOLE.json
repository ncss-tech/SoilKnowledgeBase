  "OVERVIEW": "The Metole series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from travertine. These soils are on travertine terraces and have slopes of 1 to 6 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
