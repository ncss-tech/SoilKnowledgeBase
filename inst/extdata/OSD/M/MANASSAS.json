  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments of shale, siltstone, conglomerate or quartz range from 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon and the upper part of the B horizon and from 10 to 60 percent in the lower part of the B horizon and C horizon.  The soil is very strongly or strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon commonly has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Horizons with value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 are less than 6 inches thick.  The A horizon is silt loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nMost pedons have an AB horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6; dry color value is 5 or more.  It is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The lower part of the Bt horizon is mottled in most pedons.\nThe BC horizon has colors similar to the Bt2 horizon.  It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.  Cr horizons are in some pedons.  They are commonly weathered shale or siltstone.  Thin interbeds of sandstone are allowed."

Athol soils contain rock fragments of sandstone and do not have mottles in the upper 40 inches.  Bolton, Bookwood and Duffield soils have chert and limestone rock fragments.  Brecknock, Carpenter, Door, Dormont, Frondorf, Morrison, Ryder, Washington, Westmoreland, Wheeling and Williamsburg soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the Bt2 horizon.  Carpenter soils are also well drained.  Culleoka, Loudonville and Penn soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Hayter soils are well drained and have moderately rapid permeability.  Lamotte soils contain sandstone fragments in the lower part of the solum in the Cr horizon. Legore, Myersville and Neshaminy soils have igneous rock fragments. Mechanicsburg soils have a lithologic discontinuity within 40 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Manassas soils are on footslopes, colluvial fans, along drainageways, and in narrow saddles of the Triassic lowlands in the Piedmont Province.  Slopes range from 0 to 7 percent.  The soils developed in colluvial and residual materials derived from dominantly shale, siltstone, and conglomerate.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 degrees to 59 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 36 to 44 inches."
