Bullvaro, Demner, Dooh, Nutval, and Vetagrande soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Burchflat and Vipont soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Camelback soils have lithic contacts between 40 and 80 inches from the soil surface.  Chrisflat soils are dominated by gravel and average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Dogbed soils are dominated by gravel and average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Erig soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Krenka soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Leroman and Staberg soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Lockgate soils are deep to paralithic contacts.  Snyderville soils have depth to base of the argillic horizon of less than 36 inches.  Softback soils average 25 to 32 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have mollic epipedons that do not include the upper Bt horizons.  Softscrabble soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and typically have paralithic contacts between 60 and 80 inches from the soil surface."
