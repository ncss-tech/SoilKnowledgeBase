  "OVERVIEW": "The McNye series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in reworked alluvium and colluvium derived from basalt. McNye soils are on bedrock-controlled lake terraces. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
