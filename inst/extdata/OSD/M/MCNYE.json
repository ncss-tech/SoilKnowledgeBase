  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McNye soils are on bedrock-controlled lake terraces in Pleistocene lake basins. These soils formed in reworked alluvium and colluvium derived from basalt. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. Elevations range from 1,375 to 1,895 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
