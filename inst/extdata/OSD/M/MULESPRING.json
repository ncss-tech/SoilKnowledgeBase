  "OVERVIEW": "The Mulespring series consists of shallow to fractured bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from metamorphic materials. Mulespring soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 55 degrees F.",
