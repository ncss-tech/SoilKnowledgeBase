  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 degrees to 42 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches without an O horizon ranges from 55 degrees to 59 degrees F. The depth to quartzite or other bedrock is more than 40 inches but is commonly less than 60 inches. The control section is medium textured and averages 8 to 18 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments, mostly angular quartzite pebbles, cobbles, and stones. The entire profile is strongly or moderately acid. The base saturation of the A horizon to a depth of 7 inches is 35 to 50 percent and the base saturation of the Bw horizon is 50 to 75 percent. The umbric epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick. The upper 7 inches of the A1 horizon contains 3 to 7 percent organic matter having a C:N ratio of 13.5 to 19. The A horizon is commonly darker (lower in value or chroma) than 10YR 5/2 dry and 10YR 3/2 moist. It has weak or moderate platy or weak or moderate, very fine or fine granular or crumb structure. The A horizon below a depth of 7 inches has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak medium subangular blocky to weak very fine or fine granular or crumb structure. The A and B horizons are loam or silt loam and are gravelly and very gravelly. The Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, and 3 through 5 moist. It has weak subangular blocky to weak granular or crumb structure or it is massive."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bellamy, Bryan, Henline, Nagitsy, Tallac, Walcott, and Wallis series. Bellamy soils have bouldery control sections and have mica schist at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Bryan soils are sandy. Henline soils have slightly acid, moderately coarse textured control sections with 50 to 80 percent coarse fragments and have basalt bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Nagitsy soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 16 inches and have quartzite bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Tallac soils have base saturation of less than 50 percent throughout, and have silica-cemented duripans at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Walcott soils have large stones and boulders throughout the control section in a sandy loam matrix that has a pH of 4.3 to 5.3 and a base saturation less than 50 percent. Wallis soils have bouldery control sections containing more than 60 percent rock fragments and base saturation less than 50 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moohoo soils are on hilly to very steep uplands at elevations of 6,000 to 9,000 feet. Slopes range from about 8 to 80 percent. The soils formed mainly in colluvium and residuum weathered from quartzite or hard sandstone. Some loess may be in the upper part. The climate is subhumid continental. Mean annual temperature is 34 to 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 28 inches including 5 to 12 feet of snowfall. The freeze-free period is 30 to 70 days."
