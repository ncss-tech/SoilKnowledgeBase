  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 13 to 25 inches.  Depth to bedrock exceeds 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 62 degrees F.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the entire soil to 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  EC ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  EC ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt argillic horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay, sandy clay, or heavy clay loam with 35 to 60 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay, sandy clay, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  This horizon is typically part of the diagnostic argillic.  Clay ranges from 30 to 60 percent but averages more than 35 percent when prorated for the entire argillic horizon.  EC ranges from 0 to 2 mmhos.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent typically ranges from 4 to 14 percent but may range to 20 percent in discontinuous strata.  This horizon does not meet the requirements of a calcic.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is typically fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam above 40 inches.  Thin strata of coarser material may occur below 40 inches.  EC ranges from 0 to 4 mmhos.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Milren soils are on relict fan aprons, fan piedmonts, and terraces in cold intermountain basins and uplands.  These soils formed in moderately fine textured alluvium weathered from clay-bearing sedimentary rock.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow and rain during April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 34 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 80 to 110 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."

Abston soils have over 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the Bt horizon and have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Bosler soils have fine loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal substrata control sections.  Cragosen soils are loamy-skeletal and do not have any diagnostic subsurface horizons.  Rock River soils have less than 35 percent clay in the control section and lack the abrupt textural clay increase."
