  "OVERVIEW": "The Myton series consists of deep and very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Myton soils formed in colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees\nF.",
