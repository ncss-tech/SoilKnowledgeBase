  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches and typically is the same as the depth to carbonates but some pedons have carbonates in the lower part of the subsoil.  Thichness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 24 percent.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part of the solum and from 2 to 35 percent in the lower solum and in the substratum.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline in the substratum and the calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 25 percent.  Aquic conditions occur either within 16 inches of the mineral soil surface in horizons with redox features or within 30 inches of the mineral soil surface in one or more horizons totaling 6 inches or more that have one or more of the following: a.  Value of 4 or more and redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less; b. Hue of 10YR or redder and chroma of 2 or less; or c. Hue of 2.5Y or yellower and chroma of 3 or less.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is loam.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Typically texture is mostly loam or sandy clay loam but some pedons have subhorizons of clay loam.  In some pedons, the Bt horizon grades to sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the gravelly analogs in the lower part.\nSome pedons have a Btk horizon in the lower part of the solum with color like the Bt horizon above.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon with colors and textures similar to the C horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.  The C horizon averages 8 to 17 percent clay and has more than 52 percent sand."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Andres, Aztalan, Darroch, Francesville, Gilboa, Houstenader, La Hogue, Lahoguess, Le Sueur, Newhaven, Odell, Protivin, and Vigar series.  Andres, Gilboa, Houstenader, Le Sueur, and Protivin soils all average more than 24 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Aztalan, Darroch, and La Hogue soils all are stratified in the lower part of the series control section.  Francesville soils have a densic contact within the series control section and a lithic contact at 40 to 80 inches. Lahoguess soils have more than 80 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Newhaven soils have lamellae (E & BT horizons) in the lower part of the argillic horizon and do not have free carbonates within the series control section.  Odell soils have loam till with less than 52 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Vigar soils need to be reclassified as Aquic Pachic Argiudolls."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from about 125 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1400 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barry, Griswold, Kidder, and Ringwood series.  The well drained Griswold soils and the poorly drained Barry soils form a drainage sequence with Marcellon soils.  The well drained Ringwood soils are nearby in higher landscape positions than those of Marcellon soils where there is a 15 to 30 inch thick silty mantle.  The well drained Kidder soils occupy higher landscape positions than those of Marcellon soils, where the surface layer is thinner and lighter colored."

Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately rapid in the substratum.  Marcellon soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period November to May in 6 or more out of 10 years."
