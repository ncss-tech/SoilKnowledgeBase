  "OVERVIEW": "The Mantador series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in calcareous moderately coarse glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on delta and lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation is about 580 mm.",
