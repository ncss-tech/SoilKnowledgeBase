Base saturation ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizons are 7.5YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4 dry and 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2 and 4/3 moist.  Clay content is 15 to 25 percent.\nThe Bt horizons are 5YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 dry and 5YR 4/4, 4/6; 7.5YR 4/6 and 5/4 moist.
