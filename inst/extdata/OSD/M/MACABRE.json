  "OVERVIEW": "The Macabre series consists of soils that are moderately deep to decomposing welded tuff and deep to hard fractured welded tuff bedrock. They are well drained and are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
