    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McDole soils are on terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. They formed in silty alluvium derived dominantly from loess. The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches and the average annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 4,200 to 5,200 feet. Some areas receive runoff water from adjacent areas."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Declo, Neeley, Paniogue, Parehat, Penoyer, Pocatello, Tickason, and Wheeler soils.  Declo soils lack mollic epipedons and are coarse-loamy. Neeley soils have a calcic horizon at a depth of less than 20 inches. Paniogue soils lack mollic epipedons and have sand and gravel at moderate depths.  Parehat soils are fine-silty and somewhat poorly drained. Penoyer, Pocatello and Wheeler soils lack mollic epipedons. Tickason soils are coarse-loamy and have calcic horizons. Declo, Paniogue and Tickason soils are on higher, older stream terraces. Neeley and Pocatello soils are on loess-covered fan terraces. Wheeler soils are on eroded south slopes of fan terraces and foothills. Parehat soils are in concave, less well-drained positions on stream terraces. Penoyer soils are on convex areas on stream terraces."
