    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F at 20 inches and remains above 47 degrees F throughout the year.  The soil is dry between 8 inches and the paralithic contact in most years from June 1 to October 15, moist in all parts from December 1 to May 1 and moist in some part for the rest of the year.  Weighted average clay content of the textural control section is 35 to 70 percent.  Clay content of the argillic horizon decreases by 20 to 30 percent of the maximum above the paralithic contact.  Base saturation ranges from 15 to 35 percent throughout the argillic horizon.  Content of weatherable minerals in the 20 to 200 micron faction of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon is less than 10 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7.5YR 6/2, 5/4, 6/4, 7/4. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 5/3, 5/4, 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 5/4, 5YR 4/4. Dry color in the surface 1 to 2 inches in some pedons is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 7.5YR 5/2, and moist color is 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2.  Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or loam with 10 to 25 percent clay. Content of coarse fragments is 0 to 35 percent with 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon is 10YR 7/2, 7/3, 7.5YR 7/2; or 5YR 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 5/4, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/2; or 5YR 5/3.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy clay or clay.  Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon is variegated with 2 to 4 or more colors in each subhorizon.  The upper subhorizons are the most red.  Pedons in swale areas generally are less red.  Dominant color has hue of 10R through 10YR; value of 5, 6 or 7 dry and 4, 5 or 6 moist; and chroma of 4, 6 or 8 dry or moist.  The minor color has hue of 10YR through 5Y or neutral; value of 7 or 8 dry or moist; and chroma of 0, 1 or 2 dry or moist. Texture is clay, sandy clay or silty clay with 40 to 70 percent clay. Clay content decreases with depth.  Content of unrelated gravel that has moved down into cracks from the horizons above is 0 to 5 percent. Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2BCt horizon is variegated with 2 to 4 or more colors.  Individual colors are similar to the 2Bt horizon.  Dominant color has hue of 10YR through 5Y or neutral; value of 7 or 8 dry or moist; and chroma of 0, 1 or 2 dry or moist.  The minor color has hue of 10R through 10YR; value of 5, 6 or 7 dry and 4, 5 or 6 moist; and chroma of 4, 6 or 8 dry or moist.  Texture is clay, sandy clay, or sandy clay loam with 27 to 55 percent clay.  Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2Cr horizon is variegated with 2 to 4 or more colors in the upper part but becomes more uniform with depth.  Dominant color is 2.5YR 7/2, 8/2; 5Y 8/1, 8/2, or N 8/0.  Moist color is 10YR 7/1; 2.5Y 7/2; 5Y 7/1, 6/3; or N 7/0.  Minor colors include any color described in the 2Bt horizons.  Reaction is extremely acid to very strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mokelumne soils are on dissected terraces, hills, sideslopes of terrace remnants and in swales at elevations of 160 to 500 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in hillslope alluvium underalin by material weathered from sandstone or weakly consolidated clayey marine sediments of the Ione Formation.  Coarse fragments in the material above the claypan contain dark metamorphic and quartzitic  rocks.  Climate is subhumid, with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 19 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F, average January temperature is 45 degrees F and average July temperature is 78 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 275 days."

Creviscreek soils have a fine-loamy textural control section and are on stream terraces.  Vleck soils have a duripan and are on footslopes of hills."
