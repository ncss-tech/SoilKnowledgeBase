The series was revised in January 2001 as part of the MLRA 150A update.  Classification was changed from an active to semiactive CEC/Clay class.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from soils with similar parent material taken from Austin, Waller, and Harris Counties.\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
