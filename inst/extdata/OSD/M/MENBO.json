  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Menbo soils are on hills, mountains, plateaus, and ravines. They typically occur on north-facing backslope positions. These soils formed in volcanic ash, residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 1,345 to 1,680 meters in Oregon and up to 2,230 meters in Nevada. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 300 to 380 mm but ranges to 250 mm in some areas (North Lake County, Oregon). The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
