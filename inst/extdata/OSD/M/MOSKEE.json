  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 35 inches.  Depth to accumulation of secondary carbonates is 10 to 35 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.   Rock fragments are typically absent but may range from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  These soils are usually dry but are moist in all or some part of the moisture control section for more than 40 cumulative days between May 15 and July 15 in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Texture is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  Sandy clay loam and loamy sand are allowed in the upper part.  EC is less than 2 mmhos/cm.  A BA or AB horizon may be present in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy clay loam or loam.  It may have subhorizons with textures of very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  EC is less than 2 mmhos/cm.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR. 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 12 percent. EC is less than 2 mmhos/cm.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam with clay ranging from 10 to 25 percent. Calcium carbonate ranges from 3 to 15 percent.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  EC is less than 4 mmhos/cm.\nSome pedons have a C horizon below the Bk horizon.  Except for the carbonate accumulation it has properties similar to the Bk horizon."

Ascalon and Shalona soils are moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section for 60 consecutive days following July 15 in most years and occur in areas of uniform spring and summer precipitation.  Asparas, Capulin, Datil and Featherlegs soils have calcic horizons.  Bresser, Critchell, Lavate, Loarc and Noden soils do not have secondary carbonate accumulations above 40 inches.  Cedak, Dagflat, Hargreave, Hemingford, Hirac, Kirtley and Ryegate soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Harlan soils have hue of 5YR or redder throughout.  Recluse, Satanta and Sugardee have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the Bt horizon.  Wages soils have the base of the Bt horizon at 7 to 15 inches.

They formed in mixed alluvium, colluvium or eolian deposits.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent. Elevations are 3,500 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 17 inches with about half falling as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual air temperature is about 44 to 49 degrees F.
