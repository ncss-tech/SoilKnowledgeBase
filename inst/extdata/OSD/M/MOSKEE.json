  "OVERVIEW": "The Moskee series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium, colluvium or eolian deposits.  Moskee soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, and toeslopes and footslopes of hills and ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.   Rock fragments are typically absent but may range from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  These soils are usually dry but are moist in all or some part of the moisture control section for more than 40 cumulative days between May 15 and July 15 in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Texture is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  Sandy clay loam and loamy sand are allowed in the upper part.  EC is less than 2 mmhos/cm.  A BA or AB horizon may be present in some pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sandy clay loam or loam.  It may have subhorizons with textures of very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  EC is less than 2 mmhos/cm.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR. 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 12 percent.

Ascalon and Shalona soils are moist in some or all parts of the moisture control section for 60 consecutive days following July 15 in most years and occur in areas of uniform spring and summer precipitation.  Asparas, Capulin, Datil and Featherlegs soils have calcic horizons.  Bresser, Critchell, Lavate, Loarc and Noden soils do not have secondary carbonate accumulations above 40 inches.  Cedak, Dagflat, Hargreave, Hemingford, Hirac, Kirtley and Ryegate soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Harlan soils have hue of 5YR or redder throughout.  Recluse, Satanta and Sugardee have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the Bt horizon.  Wages soils have the base of the Bt horizon at 7 to 15 inches.
