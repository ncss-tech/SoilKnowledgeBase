  "OVERVIEW": "The Meadowbank series consists of very deep, well drained soils on stream terraces. They formed in loess and in stratified loamy or sandy outwash. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 millimeters (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
