Broadwell, Douglas, Gymer, Plano, Richwood, Tama, and Wakenda soils average less than 20 percent sand in the middle part of the series control section. Douglas soils also have glacial till at a depth of 100 to 150 cm (40 to 60 inches). Dinsdale, Ogle, Parkway, Proctor, and Sidell soils average more than 15 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Ogle soils also have a paleosol in the lower part of the series control section. Proctor soils also have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 13.3 degrees C (56 degrees F).

Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (54 to 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation varies from 1016 to 1219 millimeters (40 to 48 inches). Frost-free period is 175 to 205 days. Elevation is 100 to 225 meters (325 to 735 feet) above mean sea level."

Alvin and Skelton soils formed in loamy and sandy material and are on ridge crests and side slopes. The somewhat poorly drained Newhaven soils and poorly drained Springerton soils are loamy throughout and are in lower positions on the terrace. Ridgway soils are the forest equivalent of the Meadowbank soils. Tippecanoe soils are loamy throughout and are in similar positions."
