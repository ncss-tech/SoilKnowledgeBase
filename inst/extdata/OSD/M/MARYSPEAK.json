  "OVERVIEW": "The Maryspeak series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy colluvium in ancient landslide deposits derived from a mixture of coarse-grained intrusive igneous rocks and sandstone. Maryspeak soils occur on summits, backslopes, and footslopes of mountains. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 135 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Medial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties.\nParticle-size control section (Sandy-skeletal family) - from 12 to 42 inches (1 inch of the BA horizon, Bw1 horizon, and 8 inches of the BC horizon).\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nClassification revision 12/01 from loamy-skeletal, isotic Andic Dystrocryepts to sandy-skeletal, isotic Andic Dystrocryepts based on lab data and associated soils."
