Medial modifiers were used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not meeting andic soil properties. A proposal was submitted to NSSC (2000) to revise the definition of medial to also include those soil properties qualifying for the Andic subgroup under criteria #1 for andic soil properties.\nParticle-size control section (Sandy-skeletal family) - from 12 to 42 inches (1 inch of the BA horizon, Bw1 horizon, and 8 inches of the BC horizon).\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nClassification revision 12/01 from loamy-skeletal, isotic Andic Dystrocryepts to sandy-skeletal, isotic Andic Dystrocryepts based on lab data and associated soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data for S01OR003-010, NSSL, Lincoln, NE., 11/01\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
