  "OVERVIEW": "The Mitre series consists of soils that are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained moderately permeable soils on uplands.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils formed in gravelly alluvium washed from igneous hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",
