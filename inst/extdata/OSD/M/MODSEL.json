The particle-size control section has 35 to 40 percent clay and averages 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Rock fragments range from 35 to 50 percent by volume. Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 4 percent in the Ap and BAt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry. Texture is ashy loam or cobbly ashy loam.
