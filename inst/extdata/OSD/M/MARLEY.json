  "OVERVIEW": "The Marley series consists of deep to duripan, well drained soils formed in loess and silty alluvium.  Marley soils are on basalt plains and buttes and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
