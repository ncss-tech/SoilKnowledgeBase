  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Merkel series consists of moderately deep (to a densic contact), well drained soils that formed glacial till derived from granitic sources with a mixture of volcanic ash in the upper part. These soils are on hillslopes, mountain slopes and moraines. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 525 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
