  "OVERVIEW": "The McCree series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from rhyolite or granodiorite, mixed with volcanic ash and pumice in the upper part.  McCree soils are on mountainsides and ridgetops with southerly aspects and have slopes of 8 to 90 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  Solum is 14 to 27 inches thick and depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.  The influence of volcanic ash extent is 14 to 27 inches.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.80 to 1.00 g/cc, volcanic ash content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Below 14 inches the acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron is 0.40 to 1.0 percent.\nThe A horizon, where present, has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very stony fine sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  Texture is extremely stony sandy loam, very stony sandy loam, or very cobbly sandy loam."

Belzar, Kloochman, and Rinker soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Hartill and Illabot soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Inkler soils have a massive and firm 2C horizon in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Newbell soils have a solum 10 to 14 inches thick and are silt loam or loam in the cambic horizon.  Scotties soils have a solum 12 to 22 inches thick and the upper 7 to 14 inches is more than 60 percent volcanic ash.  Sugarbowl soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days.  Threemile soils have a 7 to 14 inch thick mantle with more than 60 percent volcanic ash and are calcareous in the lower part of the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in colluvium mostly from rhyolite or granodiorite, mixed with volcanic ash and pumice in the upper part.  Elevations are 2,300 to 5,300 feet.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F; the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 42 to 45 degrees F.  The growing season at 28 degrees F is about 130 to 175 days."
