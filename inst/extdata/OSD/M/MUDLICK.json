  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudlick series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on mountain sides in MLRA 116C. They formed in colluvium and residuum from diorite. Slopes range from 8 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F, and mean annual preciptation is about 46 inches.",
