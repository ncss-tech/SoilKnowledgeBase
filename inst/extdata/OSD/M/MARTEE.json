  "OVERVIEW": "The Martee series consists of shallow somewhat excessively drained soils on mountain slopes.  These soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The average annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches, with some of it as snow at the higher elevations.  The mean January temperature is about 38 to 45 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 66 to 72 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 56 degrees F.

Tweedy soils are moderately deep, and have a fine-loamy argillic horizon.  Martee soils occur in bouldery areas near Rock outcrops, and other soils occur between Rock outcrops."
