    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Martee soils are on mountain slopes of 30 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from granitic rock.  Elevations are 4,500 to 7,700 feet.  Rock outcrops are associated with this soil in most areas.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 20 inches, with some of it as snow at the higher elevations.  The mean January temperature is about 38 to 45 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 66 to 72 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 56 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 80 to 180 days."

Sorrell soils are moderately deep, and have a coarse-loamy argillic horizon.  Tollhouse soils are shallow with less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Tweedy soils are moderately deep, and have a fine-loamy argillic horizon.  Martee soils occur in bouldery areas near Rock outcrops, and other soils occur between Rock outcrops."
