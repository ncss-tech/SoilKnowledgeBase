The argillic horizon has 8 to 18 percent clay. Stony and very stony surface phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. In cultivated areas, the Ap horizon has a value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. The A or Ap horizon is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or silt loam. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Dry hue is the same, value is 6 or 7, and chroma is 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam. It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E/B or B/E horizon has properties similar to the E and Bt horizon respectively. The E part has properties that qualify for albic material.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam. It is strongly acid to slightly acid. Bulk density ranges from 1.50 to 1.70 gm/cc. The base status is greater than 60 percent.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 5YR or less commonly 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. It is moderately acid to neutral. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.80gm/cc.\nThe BCd horizon has hue of 5YR or less commonly 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Clay content averages more than 7 percent. It is moderately acid to neutral. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.80 to 2.0 gm/cc. It is considered to be densic material."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Aftad, Blowers, Freeon, Frogcreek, Haugen, Neopit, and Scott Lake series. Aftad soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section and typically do not have coarse fragments. Blowers soils have carbonates within a depth of 30 to 60 inches. Freeon soils have more than 50 percent silt in the upper 12 to 36 inches of the series control section. Frogcreek soils average less than 7 percent clay in the lower third of the series control section. Haugen soils have base saturation below 60 percent in some part of the argillic horizon. Neopit soils do not have densic material in the lower third of the series control section. Scott Lake soils have stratified sandy outwash within a depth of 40 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on drumlins and moraines. Slope ranges from 2 to 45 percent. Milaca soils formed in noncalcareous, Superior lobe dense loamy till of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33 inches. Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 145 days. Elevation ranges from 670 to 1,450 feet above sea level."

The very poorly drained Adolph and Giese soils are in depressions. The poorly drained Cebana, Parent, and Ronneby soils are on flats or in swales. The Brennyville and Mora soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on less sloping and or lower lying positions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 13 inches (Ap and E horizons); albic horizon - the zone from 9 to 13 inches (E horizon); glossic horizon - the zone from 13 to 17 inches (B/E horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from about 13 to 43 inches (B/E, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons); densic contact - the zone beginning at 43 inches (BCd horizon); oxyaquic feature - redoximorphic accumulations and saturation within 40 inches. Aquic condition based on a presumed positive reaction with alpha-alpha dipyridyl at some time during normal years.\nThis red parent material does not produce reduced soil colors typical of other parent materials. Base saturation above 60 percent in all parts of argillic horizon. The dense till has repetitive fracturing that affects water movement and root penetration. This soil was previously classified as a coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Typic Hapludalfs. Field investigations has shown a predominance of a glossic horizon in this soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
