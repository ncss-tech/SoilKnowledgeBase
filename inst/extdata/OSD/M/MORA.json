Fallcreek, Hatley, Magroc, Oesterle, Plover and Rosy soils do not have densic materials within the series control section. Brennyville, Hatley and Magnor soils have a silt loam mantle over 12 inches thick. Glendenning soils have base saturation below 60 percent in some part of the argillic horizon. Magroc soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Oesterle soils have sandy and gravelly outwash within a depth of 40 inches. Plover and Rosy soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section. Stinnett soils average less than 7 percent clay in the dense till."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 12 inches (A and E horizons); albic horizon - the zone from 8 to 12 inches (E horizon); glossic horizon - the zone from 12 to 17 inches (B/E horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 36 inches (B/E, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons); densic contact - the zone beginning at 46 inches (BCd horizon); aquic subgroup - low chroma redoximorphic features in upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Aquic condition based on a presumed positive reaction with alpha-alpha dipyridyl at some time during the year in 6 out of 10 years. This red parent material does not produce reduced soil colors typical of other parent materials. Base saturation above 60 percent in all parts of the argillic horizon. The dense till has repetitive fracturing that affects water movement and root penetration.\nThis soil was previously classified as a coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Hapludalfs. Field investigations have shown a predominance of a glossic horizon in this soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
