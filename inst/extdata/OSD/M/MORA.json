  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 12 inches (A and E horizons); albic horizon - the zone from 8 to 12 inches (E horizon); glossic horizon - the zone from 12 to 17 inches (B/E horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 36 inches (B/E, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons); densic contact - the zone beginning at 46 inches (BCd horizon); aquic subgroup - low chroma redoximorphic features in upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Aquic condition based on a presumed positive reaction with alpha-alpha dipyridyl at some time during the year in 6 out of 10 years. This red parent material does not produce reduced soil colors typical of other parent materials. Base saturation above 60 percent in all parts of the argillic horizon. The dense till has repetitive fracturing that affects water movement and root penetration.\nThis soil was previously classified as a coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Aquic Hapludalfs. Field investigations have shown a predominance of a glossic horizon in this soil."
