    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is generally 9 to 15 inches and ranges from 8 to 20 inches. The layer of carbonate accumulation is at some depth between 16 and 28 inches.  The series control section averages very gravelly loam and contains more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 50 percent by volume of the A horizon and from 35 to 80 percent of the B and C horizons.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to be 49 or 50 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature to range from 65 to 73 degrees F.\nThe A horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak to moderate, very fine to medium granular structure.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline and is noncalcareous.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist and 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly loam, cobbly loam or very cobbly heavy silt loam.  The B horizon has weak to moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly to moderately alkaline, and noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, and 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very cobbly light loam or heavy loam.  The matrix of the Bk horizon is moderately or strongly calcareous, and has some lime enrichment in the upper part.  It ranges from 4 to 40 percent carbonates."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Middle soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, and some quartzite.  Slopes are 10 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 5,000 to 7,000 feet.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual temperature is 46 to 47 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 68 to 69 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches.  The frost-free period is 80 to 120 days"

Broad soils have argillic horizons that contain less than 35 percent rock fragments and have frigid temperatures.  Picayune soils have frigid temperatures and are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock. Richmond soils lack mollic epipedons and have a lithic contact within 20 inches of the surface."
