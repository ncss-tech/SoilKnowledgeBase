    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 40 percent in the A and E horizons and 15 to 75 percent in the BE and Bt horizons.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some pedons may have accumulations of iron masses of high value and chroma.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction."

Grimsley, Joppa and Pocono soils are in closely related families.  Croom soils are dominated by sand in the fine earth fraction and have a very firm, extremely hard Bt horizon.   Elliber and Mertz soils have rock fragments dominated by chert.  Gainesboro, Irondale and Lew soils are moderately deep.  Grimsley, Joppa ad Pocono soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Hartleton soils are formed in glacial till derived from sandstone and shale.  Lew soils have rock fragments dominated by greenstone. Pattenburg and Gainesboro soils have redder hues in the Bt horizon.  Trevlac soils are deep and formed in residuum weathered from interbedded siltstone, sandstone and shale bedrock.  Weverton soils are deep and have rock fragments dominated by quartzite."

Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent but are commonly 2 to 15 percent. They are on mountain foot slopes and benches.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches.
