  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Macove series are very deep and well drained.  They formed in colluvium from acid shale and fine grain sandstone.  They are on nearly level to steep mountain foot slopes and benches.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Grimsley, Joppa and Pocono soils are in closely related families.  Croom soils are dominated by sand in the fine earth fraction and have a very firm, extremely hard Bt horizon.   Elliber and Mertz soils have rock fragments dominated by chert.  Gainesboro, Irondale and Lew soils are moderately deep.  Grimsley, Joppa ad Pocono soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Hartleton soils are formed in glacial till derived from sandstone and shale.  Lew soils have rock fragments dominated by greenstone. Pattenburg and Gainesboro soils have redder hues in the Bt horizon.  Trevlac soils are deep and formed in residuum weathered from interbedded siltstone, sandstone and shale bedrock.  Weverton soils are deep and have rock fragments dominated by quartzite."
