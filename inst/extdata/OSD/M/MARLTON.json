  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision narrows the range of the original series concept to moderately well drained and sets the seasonal high water table at 18 to 42 inches below the surface. This revision also relocates the series concept to Gloucester County, New Jersey. It is believed that Marlton soils have aquic conditions and episaturation. The classification of these soils as Aquic Hapludults is based on evidence of wetness other than low chroma. Low chroma mottles which are normal in other moderately well drained soils are rare in these soils. For this reason the depth to, extent and distinctness of high chroma mottles have been used so as to group these soils with soils of similar natural drainage.\nDiagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in this pedon\nare:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 10 inches (Ap\nhorizon).\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 10 to 47 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)\nAquic conditions--the soil has periodic saturation and reduction (episaturation) within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, and one or more unsaturated layers within 78 inches of the surface, occurring below the periodically saturated zone.\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nVery high glauconite content feature--averaging 20 percent pellets, by weight in the fine-earth fraction within the mineralogy control section (10-30 inch) zone (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)\nSeries Control Section-the zone from 0 to 60 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: The following pedons are available from the NRCS-Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE: S91NJ-033-001 and S75NJ-005-001\nDatabase Information:\nOSD Data Mapunit ID: To be developed\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID: 407411\nOSD User Pedon ID: Marlton-OSD\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5    Soil Name  Slope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas  Precip  Elevation\nNJ0042   Marlton    0-40   50-56    180-210    40-48   25-170\nSOI-5    FloodL  FloodH  Watertable  Kind     Months   Bedrock  Hardness\nNJ0042   NONE    NONE    1.5-3.5     PERCHED  DEC-MAY  >72\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture  3-Inch  No-10   Clay% -CEC-\nNJ0042 0-10   FSL SL L  -      80-100  10-25   -\nNJ0042 10-40  SC SCL C  -      80-100  30-45   -\nNJ0042 40-60  SR SL C   -      80-100  15-45   -\nSOI-5  Depth  PH       O.M.
