  "OVERVIEW": "The Markesan series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and in the underlying highly calcareous, loamy till on moraines.  Slope ranges from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",

Since the location in this OSD did not fall in a map unit of Markesan, the location in the OSD is changed to match the location given in the published survey which does fall in a map unit of Markesan.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon -  0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches) (Ap); argillic horizon - 23 to 46 cm (9 to 18 inches) (Bt1, 2Bt2)."
