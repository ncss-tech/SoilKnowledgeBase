They are in areas next to the Markesan series where the loess or silt mantle is thicker over the till.  Both Mendota and Plano have thicker sola and are fine-silty.  In nearby areas where the surface layer is lighter colored, the LeRoy soils are associates."

Since the location in this OSD did not fall in a map unit of Markesan, the location in the OSD is changed to match the location given in the published survey which does fall in a map unit of Markesan.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon -  0 to 18 cm (0 to 7 inches) (Ap); argillic horizon - 23 to 46 cm (9 to 18 inches) (Bt1, 2Bt2).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
