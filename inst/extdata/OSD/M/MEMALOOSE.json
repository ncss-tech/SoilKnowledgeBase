The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F. Depth to the paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The apparent clay content in the control section ranges from 27 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or gravelly loam with 5 to 25 percent hard gravel and 0 to 10 percent hard cobbles.  It is estimated to have acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and less than 2.0 cmol per kg fine earth of 1N KCL extractable aluminum.  Fine to medium concretions are common or many.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or gravelly clay loam with 5 to 25 percent hard gravel and 0 to 10 percent hard cobbles."

The soils formed in colluvium from andesite, tuffs, and breccias, mixed with volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches.  The frost-free period is 60 to 110 days."
