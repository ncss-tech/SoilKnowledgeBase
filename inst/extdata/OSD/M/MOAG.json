  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 55 degrees F. The soils are saturated with water throughout the year and subject to freshwater overflow during high tides and spring floods unless diked and artificially drained.  The soils are assumed to have an irregular decrease in organic matter.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. This horizon has moderate or strong granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has distinct or prominent redox concentrations.  This horizon is silty clay or clay and has 40 to 50 percent clay. Thin lenses of peaty or loamy material with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 are common in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 0 through 2 moist and dry. It is stratified material ranging from silty clay, silt loam or sandy loam. Redox concentrations are distinct with some areas having dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) \"pipestems\" up to 1/4 inch in diameter formed in tubular pores and channels. Thin layers of gray (10YR 6/1) ash-like material are common in some pedons."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Moag soils are on broad nearly level undulating flood plains of the Columbia River at elevations of 10 to 20 feet. They formed in fine textured recent alluvium of mixed origin. The winters are cool and moist and summers are warm and dry. The mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 68 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 165 to 210 days. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches."
