    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 63 to 69 degrees F.  These soils are dry in the moisture control section more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F and are continually dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days during the summer months in more than 6 out of 10 years.\nThe depth to the indurated hardpan ranges from 20 to 36 inches. Depth to the Ck horizon ranges from 8 to 12 inches. The control section ranges from loam to silt loam containing l0 to 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 of 3. lt ranges from thick platy and moderate fine granular structure to weak and moderate fine subangular blocky structure. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline. A few fine lime hardpan fragments are present in some pedons.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Ckm horizon is indurated but may be fractured to a very limited extent in some pedons."

The soils formed in alluvial soil material from intermediate and basic igneous parent rocks.  The climate is semiarid.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches distributed fairly uniformly throughout the year except June is drier; 77 percent falls when the average monthly temperature is above 32 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 104 days."
