  "OVERVIEW": "The Madawaska series consists of very deep, moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial deposits on outwash plains and stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent but is dominantly between 0 and 8 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately high and high to very high in the solum and substratum.  Mean annual temperature is about 3 degrees C (43 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 in) at the type location.",

Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has weak thin platy or weak very fine or fine granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have a Bh horizon with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 4, or a Bhs horizon with chroma and value of 3 or less.  The Bh and/or Bhs is up to 10 inches thick.  The B horizons are fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  They have weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is up to 30 cm (12 in) thick.  Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam but may contain thin layers of sandy loam.  It has weak granular or play structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand, but in some pedons thin bands of coarse sand less than 5 inches thick are present."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Madawaska soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces.  Slope is dominantly 0 to 8 percent, but ranges up to 15 percent near the contact zone with upland till ridges.  The soils formed in materials derived mainly from slate, schist, gneiss, phyllite, granite, and quartzite.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to  to 1219 mm (34 to 48 in), and mean annual temperature ranges from about 3 to 7 degrees C (38 to 46 degrees F).  The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from about 6 to 610 m (20 to 2000 ft) above mean sea level."
