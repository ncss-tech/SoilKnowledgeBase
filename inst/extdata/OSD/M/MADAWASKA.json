  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 81 cm (18 to 32 in).  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume throughout the soil.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in all horizons.\nThe Ap horizon, or A horizon where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe E horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is up to 10 cm ( 4 in) thick.  Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It has weak thin platy or weak very fine or fine granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have a Bh horizon with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, with value and chroma of 2 to 4, or a Bhs horizon with chroma and value of 3 or less.  The Bh and/or Bhs is up to 10 inches thick.  The B horizons are fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  They have weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is up to 30 cm (12 in) thick.  Texture is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam but may contain thin layers of sandy loam.  It has weak granular or play structure.  Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand, but in some pedons thin bands of coarse sand less than 5 inches thick are present."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Madawaska soils are on outwash plains and stream terraces.  Slope is dominantly 0 to 8 percent, but ranges up to 15 percent near the contact zone with upland till ridges.  The soils formed in materials derived mainly from slate, schist, gneiss, phyllite, granite, and quartzite.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to  to 1219 mm (34 to 48 in), and mean annual temperature ranges from about 3 to 7 degrees C (38 to 46 degrees F).  The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from about 6 to 610 m (20 to 2000 ft) above mean sea level."

The well drained Allagash soils and the somewhat excessively drained and excessively drained Adams soils are in higher positions on the landscape.  The coarser textured Croghan soils are in similar positions on the landscape.  The somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained Naumburg soils are in lower positions on the landscape."
