    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  a mollic epipedon from the soil surface to 10 inches (A1 and A2 horizons); an argillic horizon which is the particle-size control section from 10 to 28 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons); a paralithic contact at 28 inches (Cr horizon).  Mishakal soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime. Areas where the Mishakal series has been mapped in Deer Lodge County are moderately impacted from past smelter emissions and may contain significant levels of heavy metal contaminants in surface horizons.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
