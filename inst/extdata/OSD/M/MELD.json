  "OVERVIEW": "The Meld series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Meld soils are on fan remnants. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

This revision updated the taxonomic class from Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitritorrandic Durixerolls, updated horizon designations, and recognized the 8 to 41 cm horizon as part of the argillic horizon.\nVolcanic glass contents are estimated based on data for the associated Chesebro and Giranch soils."
