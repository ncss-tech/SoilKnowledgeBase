Elevations range from 1,356 to 1,524 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 280 to 360 mm. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 60 to 80 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 84 cm (A, Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 8 to 84 cm (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 76 cm (A, BA, and Bt1 horizons and part of the Bt2 horizon).\nDuripan - The zone from 84 to 100 cm (Bqm horizon).\nParticle-size control section and ashy substitute class with glassy mineralogy - The zone from 8 to 58 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 and part of the Bt3 horizon).\nA revision in December 2002 updated the taxonomic class from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Argiduridic Durixerolls. This revision updated the taxonomic class from Ashy-skeletal, glassy, frigid Vitritorrandic Durixerolls, updated horizon designations, and recognized the 8 to 41 cm horizon as part of the argillic horizon.\nVolcanic glass contents are estimated based on data for the associated Chesebro and Giranch soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
