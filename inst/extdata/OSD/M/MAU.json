  "OVERVIEW": "The Mascamp series consist of shallow well drained soils that formed in residuum from basic tuff with minor admixtures of alluvium from andesite and basalt Mascamp soils are rolling foothills and mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

Cleavage soils have mollic epipedon that range from 18 to 25 cm and does not include the argillic horizon. Cleavmor soils have Btk horizons containing few to many filaments and seams of carbonate. Cropper soils have a mollic epipedon are 18 to 25 cm thick. Gaciba, Horsetrack, Pernty and Shalper soils average 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments. Slatter soils are less than 25 cm deep."

These soils developed in residuum derived from basic tuffs with minor admixtures of alluvium from andesite and basalt, and volcanic ash. These soils are at elevations of 1,520 to 1,980 meters in a cool, continental climate having mean annual precipitation of 250 to 400 mm that comes mostly as snow. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 7 degrees C., and the average frost-free season ranges from 50 to 90 days."

The series type was moved to Eureka County in 2006 to better reflect the series concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 33 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 33 to 48 cm (Bt horizon).\nLithic contact - The boundary at about 48 cm (R layer).\nParticle size control section - The zone from 33 to 48 cm (Bt horizon).\nClassification was updated to 11th edition on 07/2011 changed Lithic Argixerolls to Aridic Lithic Argixerolls.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
