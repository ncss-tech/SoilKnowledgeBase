    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 to more than 85 inches.   The soil is strongly acid to slightly acid in the A, E and upper part of the B horizons, and very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the rest of the profile.  Some pedons have few to common nodules, 0.2 to 2.0 cm in diameter commonly at depths of about 40 inches.  The mineralogy of the clay fraction is mixed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Where the value is less than 3.5, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  The A horizon is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Mottles in shades of gray, yellow, or brown are in some pedons.  The E horizon is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Mottles in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or, red are in most pedons.  The upper part of the Bt horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  The lower part of the Bt horizon in some pedons has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray are in the lower part of the Bt horizon of most pedons.  The lower part of the Bt horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, commonly has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 6 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray are in most pedons.  The Btg horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 6.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or fine sandy loam."

Blanton, Darco, Eddings, Shankler, and Troup soils do not have gray mottles in the Bt horizon.  Tehran soils do not have gray mottles in the upper part of the Bt horizon or above a depth of 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Murad soils are on smooth nearly level convex marine terraces below about 40 feet in elevation.  Slope gradients are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in sandy and loamy sediments largely of marine origin.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 66 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 50 inches, and frost-free season ranges from about 220 to 270 days."

Chisolm soils are on higher adjacent landscapes and have an arenic surface.  Coosaw soils are on adjacent landscapes and have an arenic surface.
