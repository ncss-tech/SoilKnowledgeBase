  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development is 40 to more than 80 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches, and extends into the B horizon in some pedons.  Depth to the loamy 2B horizon is 15 to 30 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section (slackwater sediments) averages 35 to 50 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand.  The lower part of the particle-size control section (loamy or sandy alluvium) contains less clay and more sand than the upper slackwater sediments.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap and A) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry); and chroma of 0 or 1.  Texture typically is silt clay but includes silty clay loam in some pedons.  An silt loam overwash phase is recognized.  Clay content averages 35 to 50 percent and sand content is less than 15 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have an AB or a BA horizon; and some pedons have a Btg horizon formed in slackwater sediments.\nThe next part of the series control section (2B horizon that formed in loamy alluvium) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Redoximorphic masses of iron accumulation typically have redder hue or higher chroma than the matrix.  Some subhorizons contain low-chroma clay films or pressure faces.  The 2B horizon typically is stratified, and is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam, and averages 15 to 25 percent clay.  The 2B horizon is calcareous and commonly contains shells of mollusks.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe lower part of the series control section (2C) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is stratified.  Individual strata range from silty clay loam to very fine sand.  Clay content ranges from less than 5 percent to about 30 percent and sand content ranges from about 10 to 95 percent.  The 2C horizon typically is calcareous and reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McFain soils are in depressions which were formerly shallow lakes on flood plains of major rivers.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in slackwater sediments and the underlying calcareous, stratified loamy or sandy alluvium that commonly contains shells of mollusks.  These soils typically are subject to frequent flooding, but some areas are occasional or rare because of levees, locks and dams, or other flood-control structures.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 210 days, and elevation is 340 to 450 feet above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Ambraw, Beaucoup, Darwin, Fults, Gorham, Landes, and Titus soils.  The poorly drained Ambraw and Gorham soils contain less clay in the upper part of the series control section and occur on similar landform positions nearby.  The poorly drained Darwin soils formed entirely in slackwater sediments and are on lower and less undulating parts of the flood plain nearby.  The well drained Landes soils contain more sand and less clay in the upper part of the solum and are on higher parts of the flood plains nearby.  The poorly drained Titus soils are on slightly higher parts of the undulating flood plain."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly and poorly drained.  The potential for surface water runoff is low or negligible.  Permeability is very slow in the upper slackwater sediments and moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy or sandy alluvium in the lower part of the solum and the substratum.  In drained areas, depth to an intermittent apparent high water table is 0.5 foot above the surface to 1 foot below from November to May in most years.  An undrained phase is recognized."

Cambic horizon - from a depth of 15 to 66 inches (2Btg, 2Btkg1, 2Btkg2, and 2BCtg horizons).  Aquic conditions - endosaturation and reduction indicated by redoximorphic features (2Btg, 2Btkg1, 2Btkg2, 2BCtg and 2Cg horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lab data for several supporting pedons are on file at the USDA/NRCS state office in Champaign, Illinois.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
