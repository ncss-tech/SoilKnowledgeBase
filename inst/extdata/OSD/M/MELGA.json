    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and the depth to a horizon which is weakly cemented with silica and lime range from 10 to 20 inches. The soil between depths of 4 and 10 inches is dry in all parts from April until December 1. It is dry in all parts intermittently the rest of the time and is not moist in some or all parts for as long as 90 consecutive days. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 65 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 6/1, 6/2; or 2.5Y 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2; or 2.5Y 4/2. It is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe A2 horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2; or 10YR 7/1 and moist color of 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2; 10YR 5/1 or 5/2. it is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/3, 6/3, 6/4; or 2.5Y 4/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 5/4; or 2.5Y 3/2. Mottles are present in some pedons and have moist color of 2.5Y N2/ or 10YR 4/4. Clay averages 27 to 35 percent and is estimated to be 5 to 18 percent more than the A horizon. Less than 15 percent of the particles are fine sand or coarser, by weighted average. Electrical conductivity (EC) range from 4 to 16 mmhos/cm. The sodium-adsorption-ratio (SAR) ranges from 50 to 250. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 3 percent.\nThe C1sica horizon has dry color of 10YR 8/3, 5/3 and moist color of 10YR 6/3, 4/2. It is weakly cemented with silica and lime, is extremely hard and brittle when dry and has very firm moist consistency. During prolonged soaking and lime, is extremely hard and brittle when dry and has very firm moist consistency. During prolonged soaking in water of HCL, fragments slake and the resultant mass contains 15 to 40 percent plate shaped fragments smaller than 2 mm and less than 2 percent angular durinodes ranging in size from 2 to 5 mm. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 12 percent. Electrical conductivity (EC) ranges from 4 to 8 mmhos/cm. The sodium-adsorption-ration (SAR) ranges from 80 to 120.\nThe lower C horizon have dry color of 10YR 5/3, 6/4, 7/3; or 2.5Y 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3; or 2.5Y 4/2. Strata of varying textures range from fine sandy loam to silty clay loam. They are noneffervescent to strongly effervescent. Lime is disseminated or segregated in soft masses, filaments or seams. Electrical conductivity (EC) of these C horizons ranges from 0.5 to 16 mmhos/cm. The sodium-adsorption-ratio (SAR) ranges from 13 to 120."

The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 7 to 8 inches. The mean January temperature is about 45 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is about 81 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F. The frost-free season is 250 to 275 days."
