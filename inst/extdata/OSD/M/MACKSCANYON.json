  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mackscanyon series consists of very deep,well drained soils that formed in alluvium from limestone and dolostone. Mackscanyon soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
