  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to carbonates range from 24 to 55 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Moist matrix color values are 4 or less throughout except for the E portion of the B/E horizon where present. If colors are darker than 4 below 10 inches, any underlying C is equally dark. Rock fragments in the mineral soil, often firm and very firm shale, range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the solum and from 5 to 55 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Dry values are 5 or less. Texture ranges from loam to silty clay loam in the fine-eath fraction. Structure is weak to strong granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nBA or B/E subhorizons are present in some, but not all, pedons. If a BA is absent, chroma is more than 2 in the upper part of the Bt.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3 with common to many redoximorphic features. Ped faces are dominated by chroma of 2, but chroma of 3 or more occupy 40 percent or more of the matrix of the upper part when the soil is broken or cut through the peds. B horizons ranges from loam to silty clay loam in texture. Structure is moderate to strong, fine to coarse blocky or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon up to 20 inches thick.\nC or Cd horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 through 3. Textures ranges from loam to silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. C horizons are massive or have plate-like divisions. Consistence is firm or very firm. Some pedons may be friable in the upper 15 inches of the C horizon. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have 2C horizons which are lighter in color."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Conover and Romulus series are members of the same family. Both Conover and Romulus soils are lighter in color throughout the profile.\nAppleton, Beardstown, Cantril, Dundas, Riceville, and Schley are similar series. None are as dark in color throughout the profile as Manheim. Monitor soils are also similar but have a thicker sola.\nSoils similar in general character but having lighter colored Ap horizons when dry include the Angola, Appleton, Aubbeenaubbe, Ayrshire, Burdett, Crosby, Darien, Digby, Haskins, Havana, Jimtown, Ovid, Sargeant, and Whitaker series. These are also lighter colored throughout the profile than Manheim."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Manheim soils occupy nearly level to gently sloping landforms of till plains. Slope is dominantly 1 to 10 percent, but can range from 0 to 15 percent. The regolith is till high in black or very dark grayish brown, neutral or calcareous shale, which contains significant amounts of both carbon and nitrogen. Limestone ranges from a minor to a major component. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual rainfall ranges from 32 to 45 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F; and the mean frost-free season ranges, from 120 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 500 to 1800 feet above sea level."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Low chroma is conspicuous throughout suggesting a Mollic Ochraqualf upon casual observation, but if care is taken to break the peds, their interiors have chroma of 3 in the upper part of the B.\nUse of Manheim in MLRA 143 is related to surveys prior to frigid/mesic separation. This would not be repeated.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n(1) Ochric Epipedon - the zone from the surface to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n(2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 18 to 28 inches (Bt horizon).\n(3) Udollic subgroup - as evidenced by a low value surface layer (Ap horizon) that meets the requirements of a mollic epipedon except thickness and a zone within 30 inches that has more than 40 percent with chroma of 3 or more (BA horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
