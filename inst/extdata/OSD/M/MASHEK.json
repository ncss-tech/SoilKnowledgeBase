    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carlshend, Chocolay, Dishno,  Peavy and Reade series in the same family and the related Hoist series. The Carlshend, Chocolay, Dishno and Reade series are underlain by bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. The Peavy series has a silty mantle and the underlying dense glacial till is noncalcareous. The Hoist series has no spodic horizon and has fewer coarse fragments."

The somewhat poorly drained Charlevoix soils are found on lower landscape positions. Poorly drained Ensley soils are found in depressions and drainageways. Well drained Onaway and Emmet soils are on higher or more sloping landscape positions."
