The mean winter soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, and are dry for 30 to 45 consecutive days in the soil moisture control section; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air dried samples, and has 50 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.  Below a depth of about 40 inches, andic soil properties are absent primarily due to the reduced organic matter and the higher bulk density.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  It has 5 to 10 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 or 6 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.  It is very gravelly medial sandy loam, or extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly or moderately acid.  It has 1 to 7 percent organic matter.\nThe BC horizon has color, texture and reaction similar to that of the Bw horizon but it has moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.20 g/cc.  It has organic matter content of less than 1 percent to 2 percent."
