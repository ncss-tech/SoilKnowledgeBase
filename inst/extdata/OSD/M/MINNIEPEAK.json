  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Minniepeak soils are on backslopes and ridgetops of mountains at elevations of 2,800 to 4,500 feet.  Slopes are 5 to 90 percent.  Minniepeak soils formed in layers of aerially deposited volcanic ash and pumice.  Beginning from the surface of the mineral soil the stratigraphy of pyroclastic material represented in a typical profile includes:  (1) fresh ash and pumice of the 176-year old \"Layer T\" and (2) pumice of the 400-year old \"layer W.\"  The climate is characterized by cool, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 125 to 135 inches including snow cover from November to June.  Average January temperature is 25 degrees F., average July temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 75 to 95 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification changed 7/98 based on 1998 Keys to Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features include:\nUnbric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to 12 inches qualifying based on mixing the upper 7 inches of the A1 and A2 horizons.\nParticle-size control section - from 0 to 40 inches with 0 to 3 inches qualifying as ashy; from 8 to 12 inches as ashy-pumiceous; from 12 to 16 inches as pumiceous; from 16 to 21 inches as ashy-pumiceous; and from 21 to 40 inches as pumiceous.  Based on the 2Bw1 horizon being less than 5 inches thick and therefore no strongly contrasting substitute particle-size classes present, the thickest part (cumulative) is used to determine the class.  The pumiceous particle-size class constitutes 23 inches and the thickest part of the control section.\nIf the concept of this pedon is Typic rather than Humic, then another modal pedon is needed to reflect an ochric epipedon.\nThis pedon also reflects horizon thickness ranges which will result in multiple particle-size classes, i.e., if the 2Bw1 was 5 or 6 inches thick, then the family class would be ashy over pumiceous.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
