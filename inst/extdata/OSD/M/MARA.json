  "OVERVIEW": "The Mara series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and sandstone.  The Mara soils are on hills and knolls.  Slopes are 2 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
