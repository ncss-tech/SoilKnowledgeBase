They formed in silty and loamy slope alluvium derived from limestone and dolostone.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 48 inches."

Delassus soils are fine-loamy, have a fragipan, and are at higher elevations.  Fourche soils have a higher base saturation and are adjacent hillslopes.  Secesh soils are well drained, fine-loamy, and are on floodplains."
