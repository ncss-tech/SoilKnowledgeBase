  "OVERVIEW": "The Marquand series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in silty and loamy slope alluvium derived from limestone and dolostone.  These soils are on terraces and footslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
