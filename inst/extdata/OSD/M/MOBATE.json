The mean annual soil temperature is about 45 to 47 degrees F.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has 5 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon have value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is gravelly ashy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam and has 15 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe BC horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam and has 35 to 55 percent gravel. Some pedons have a C horizon."

The soils formed in residuum from granite with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the surface layer.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 28 inches.  The average January temperature is about 28 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 80 to 100 days."

The upper 11 inches of this pedon is estimated to have volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent and acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.
