  "OVERVIEW": "The Mobate series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum from granite with a component of volcanic ash and loess. Mobate soils are on granitic mountainous uplands and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is about 45 to 47 degrees F.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has 5 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon have value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is gravelly ashy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam and has 15 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe BC horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam and has 35 to 55 percent gravel. Some pedons have a C horizon."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 4 inches, a cambic horizon from 4 to 17 inches, and a paralithic contact at 17 inches.  The upper 11 inches of this pedon is estimated to have volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent and acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  This descriptions reflects a change in classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid, shallow Vitrandic Xerochrepts to Loamy-skeletal, isotic, frigid, shallow Vitrandic Haploxerepts."
