  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Moonbeam soils are on lava plateaus. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. Elevations range from 1,250 to 1,830 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 300 mm, but ranges to 400 mm in some areas. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
