The climate is warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 50 inches.  The average January temperature is 43 degrees F., the average July temperature is 74 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 190 to 230 days."
