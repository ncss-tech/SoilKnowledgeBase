  "OVERVIEW": "The Mesita series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sources.\nMesita soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
