    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Carmack, Elkcreek, Johnson, Mojo, Molyneux, Moolmool (T), Muldoon, Simonton, Skelter and Suloaf series. Carmack soils have 15 to 30 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section and do not have lamellae. Elkcreek and Mojo soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and in addition, Mojo soils do not have an activity class family designated. Johnson soils do not have lamellae, are sometimes less than 40 inches deep to bedrock and are formed in loess and residuum (see remarks). Moolmool soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Muldoon soils have a duripan (Bqm horizon) and do not have an O horizon. Molyneux soils do not have an O horizon and have argillic horizons that are slightly acid or neutral. Simonton soils do not have an O horizon and do not have lamellae. Skelter soils do not have an O horizon, have extremely acid to strongly acid stratified discontinuous lithology below the argillic horizon and are dry 90 to 120. Suloaf soils have 15 to 30 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section and are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Middlefork soils are strongly sloping to steep on dissected fan remnants and outwash terrace remnants at elevations of 3,050 to 5,250 feet. These soils formed in lacustrine sediments derived from igneous rocks and fine pyroclastic materials. Slopes range from 8 to 50 percent. Average annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. Average annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. Frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Charters, Hellake, Pinney and Zeb soils. Charters soils do not have argillic horizons and occur on more exposed geomorphic positions. Hellake soils are mesic and occur on south-facing slopes. Pinney soils have pachic epipedons and occur on steeper north-facing slopes. Zeb soils are skeletal and occur on convex summits and shoulders."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nMollic epipedon - zone from 1 to 12 inches (A1 and A2 horizons)\nArgillic horizon - zone from 15 to 60 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - zone from 15 to 35 inches\nSoil moisture regime - xeric\nAll depths related to diagnostic horizons and features listed in the range of characteristics are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nFurther investigations are needed to confirm the typical depth class and soil temperature regime of the Johnson series. Presence or absence of discontinuous lamellae may not be adequate criteria for series separation. However, soil genesis of the two series is a key difference: residual material vs. lacustrine deposits.\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon has partial laboratory analysis, reference sample no. S98ID-015-003 (Pedon no. 99P59), NSSL, Lincoln, NE\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
