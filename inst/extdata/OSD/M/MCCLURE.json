  "OVERVIEW": "The McClure series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in silty materials over clayey materials on uplands.  These soils have slow permeability. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Depth to contrasting clayey material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay averaging between 35 and 45 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have carbonates in the lower part.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  The carbonates are dissemenated or accumulated.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay or clay.  It has common or many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate.

Beadle, Kirley, Peno, and Raber soils contain more sand in the argillic horizon.   In addition, Beadle, Peno, and Raber soils formed in glacial till.  Carlson, Harney, Mento, and Spearville soils have annual temperature higher than 52 degrees F.  In addition, Carlson soils typically have carbonates at shallower depths and formed in calcareous residuum or alluvium; Harney soils typically have thicker sola; Mento soils have 5 to 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the B and C horizons; and Spearville soils typically contain more clay in the argillic horizon."

Agar soils have fine-silty control sections. Carter, Hurley, and Promise soils contain more clay in the series control section and are in nearby landcapes.  In addition, Carter and Hurley soils contain appreciable amounts of exchangeable sodium in the control section. Onita soils are in swales.  Reliance soils are in the same landscapes. Onita soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 20 inches.  Reliance soils do not have contrasting clayey material within a depth of 40 inches."
