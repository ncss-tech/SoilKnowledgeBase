(Bkk, B'k horizons)\nCarbonate plugged horizon (kk): 76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 in) (Bkk horizon)\nNote: the kk feature is defined as pedogenic carbonate accumulation that is characterized by laterally continuous carbonates that have engulfed rock, sand, silt, and clay particles; plugged the macroporosity of the soil horizon with 50 percent or more calcium carbonate; and obliterated the original soil structure.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL sample - S07NM041-001\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
