The soils are dry above the 36 inch depth more than 60 consecutive days during most summers.  The A horizons have colors in the 10YR hue with values of 3 to 5 and chromas of 2 or 3.  Textures are gravelly or very gravelly and cobbly fine sandy loam to coarse sandy loam.  Structure is weak to moderate subangular blocky and consistence is slightly hard and friable.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.  The B2 horizon colors are in the 7.5YR hue with values of 3 or 4 and chromas of 3 or 4.  The soils are massive and consistence is slightly hard, friable and slightly sticky.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline."

The Ben Hur soils are medium and acid and have bedrock at 22 inches.  The Calpine soils have medium acid light yellowish brown B2 horizons and Crouch soils have yellowish brown sandy loam B2 horizons.  The Elder and Molinos soils are nongravelly sandy loams.  Nord soils have brown calcareous light loam C horizons and Rancheria soils have strongly acid B2 horizons.  Visalia soils are grayish brown, mildly alkaline, fine sandy loams."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Millrace soils occur on nearly level narrow flood plains on alluvium derived mainly from basic rocks.  They occur at elevations of 200 to 500 feet, in a subhumid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 20 to 35 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., average January temperature about 46 degrees F., and average July temperature about 81 degrees F.  Frost-free season averages about 270 days."
