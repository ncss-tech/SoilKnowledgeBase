  "OVERVIEW": "The Manvel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from soft limestone and shale.  Manvel soils are on fans, plains, and interfluves. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. (52 degrees F.).",
