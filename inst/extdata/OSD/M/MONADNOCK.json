    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mineral solum ranges from 38 to 91 cm. Depth to bedrock is greater than 165 cm. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the mineral solum and from 5 to 60 percent in the substratum. Stones range from 0 to 20 percent in the surface layer, 0 to 15 percent in the subsoil, and 0 to 25 percent in the substratum. Cobbles range from 0 to 35 percent in the surface layer, 0 to 15 percent in the subsoil, and 0 to 20 percent in the substratum. Gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the surface layer, 0 to 20 percent in the subsoil, and 0 to 45 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe O horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It consists of slightly, moderately, and/or highly decomposed organic material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR and value and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture range is the same as the A horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture range is typically the same as the A horizon but the range includes loamy sand.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon with hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR and value and chroma of 3 or less. The Bhs horizon is dominantly fine sandy loam, but may include loam, sandy loam and very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. The Bs horizons are loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a thin C horizon overlying a contrasting 2C horizon. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand in the fine-earth fraction. Less typically, some pedons may range to sand. It has weak thick plates of geogenic origin, or it is massive or single grain. Consistence ranges from loose to firm. Some pedons have lenses or pockets of sand or sandy loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Allagash and Highmarket (T) series are in related families. Allagash soils have fewer rock fragments in the particle size control section. Highmarket (T) soils are derived from sedimentary materials and have sandstone, siltstone, or shale rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Monadnock soils are nearly level to very steep soils on glaciated uplands. They are typically on convex parts of summits, shoulders, and backslopes. The soils formed in loamy over sandy Wisconsin age melt-out till derived mainly from schist, granite, gneiss, and quartzite. The till generally contains stones and/or boulders. Slope ranges from 0 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1640 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 150 days.  Elevation commonly ranges from 100m to  900m."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adams, Becket, Berkshire, Colton, Croghan, Hermon, Kinsman, Lyman, Lyme, Marlow, Success, Sunapee, and Tunbridge soils on nearby landscapes. The Monadnock soils are in a drainage sequence with the moderately well drained Sunapee soils and the poorly drained Lyme soils. The somewhat excessively drained Adams, excessively drained Colton, moderately well drained Croghan, and poorly drained Kinsman soils are on kames, terraces, and eskers. They are coarser textured in the solum. The well drained Becket and Marlow soils and the moderately well drained Skerry and Peru soils are on smooth sloped landforms. Becket, Marlow, Peru, and Skerry soils formed in compact dense till. The somewhat excessively drained Hermon and Success soils and the well drained Berkshire soils are on similar landscape positions. Berkshire soils have finer textures in the substratum. Hermon and Success soils have coarser textures in the solum.  The somewhat excessively drained Lyman soils and well drained Tunbridge soils are on bedrock controlled landforms. Lyman soils are shallow to bedrock and Tunbridge soils are moderately deep to bedrock."
