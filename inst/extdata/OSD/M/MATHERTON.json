  "STATES": "IN,MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Matherton series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial material over gravelly or sandy outwash on outwash plains, valley trains, and stream terraces on terrace landscapes. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
