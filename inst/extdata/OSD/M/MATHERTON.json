  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Similar soils are the Brady, Homer, Ionia, and Wasepi series. Brady and Wasepi soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size class. Homer soils have moist color value of more than 3 in the A horizon. Ionia soils do not have low chroma redox depletions within the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Matherton soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, and stream terraces on terrace landscapes. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Matherton soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial material over gravelly or sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (47 to 50 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 396 meters (580 to 1,300 feet) above mean sea level."

The well drained Fox soils, the moderately well drained Ionia soils, and the very poorly drained or poorly drained Sebewa soils are in a drainage sequence with the Matherton soils. The very poorly drained or poorly drained Gilford soils have a mollic epipedon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. The depth to the seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) below the surface for some time in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the loamy material and high or very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the loamy material and rapid or very rapid in the underlying material."
