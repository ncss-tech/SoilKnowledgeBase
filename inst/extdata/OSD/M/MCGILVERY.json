  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock and thickness of the organic layers range from 4 to 20inches.   The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 46 to 48 degrees F. The soils are not frozen in most years due to maritime influence.\nThe organic layers consists of undecomposed to well decomposed leaves, twigs, and needles.\nHue in the C horizon range from 5YR through 10YR, with value moist from 2 through 5, and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam, sandy loam or loam.  Rock fragment content ranges from 10 to 75 percent; gravel content ranges from 10 to 60 percent, cobble content ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  pH is less than 4.5 (0.01M calcium chloride) in the organic layers."

The Karta, Tolstoi, and Wadleigh soils are mineral soils and occur on hillslopes.  Kina and Kogish soils are poorly drained organic soils which occur in muskegs. Maybeso soils are very poorly drained forested muskeg soils which are underlain by glacial till."
