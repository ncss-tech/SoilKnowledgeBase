  "OVERVIEW": "The Manastash series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils formed in loess and alluvium. Manastash soils are on fan remnants, terrace remnants,  and partial ballenas of piedmonts. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.

Depth to the duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches thick. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent clay in the fine earth fraction. The upper part of the argillic horizon has a clay increase of at least 20 percent, absolute, within a vertical distance of 3 inches or 15 percent, absolute, within a vertical distance of 1 inch.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is loam or cobbly loam.  It has 15 to 20 percent clay.  Slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Manastash soils are on fan remnants interspersed with partial ballenas of piedmont slopes and on terrace remnants. Relict flat summit areas with broad rounded shoulders are typical; however, lateral stream migration and undercutting has produced angular shoulders in some places. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. Manastash soils formed in old alluvium mixed with loess over cemented gravels of the Ellensburg formation. Clayey argillic horizons and indurated duripans commonly cover the entire ballena or fan remnant. Elevations are 1,500 to 2,900 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm and dry summers and cool and moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 170 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Gorskel, Nanum, Wenas, Woldale, and the tentative Brickmill and Wilview soils. Gorskel soils are on old alluvial fans, loamy-skeletal shallow and occur on the same land forms as Manastash soils. Nanum soils are on terraces, fine loamy, lack a duripan, and have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 75cm of the surface. Wenas soils are on bottom lands, fine-loamy, lack a duripan, and are saturated with water at some period during the year. Woldale soils are on bottom land, lack a duripan and are saturated with water at some period during the year. Brickmill soils are on alluvial fans, loamy-skeletal, lack a duripan, and have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 75cm of the surface. Of these younger soils occur in flanking washes, inset fans, or fan piedmonts between the elongated slightly higher fan remnants where Manastash soils occur."
