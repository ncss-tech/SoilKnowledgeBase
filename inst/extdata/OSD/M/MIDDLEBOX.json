  "OVERVIEW": "The Middlebox series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hillslopes.  They formed in residuum and colluvium from pumiceous and tuffaceous material.  Middlebox soils are on slopes of 5 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Organic matter is less than one percent.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.
