Volcanic glass is 30 to 50 percent.  The acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.3 to 0.6 percent.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Organic matter is less than one percent.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam with 35 to 50 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam with 35 to 50 percent gravel and cobbles."
