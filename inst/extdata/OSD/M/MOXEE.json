The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick and the depth to carbonates; when present is 10 to 13 inches thick. The particle size control section averages 10 to 35 percent coarse fragments and has 5 to 10 percent clay. Coarse fragments are lime silica cemented material and basalt and have been mixed with the loess. The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. The soil is usually dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. Texture is silt loam or gravelly silt loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk and 2Bkqm horizons have value 5 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 1 to 4 moist or dry. Texture is silt loam or gravelly silt loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 15 inches. The average January temperature is 29 degrees F. and the average July temperature of 71 degrees F. The mean annual temperature of 48 to 50 degrees F.
