  "OVERVIEW": "The Moonshine series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Moonshine soils are on hillslopes.  Slopes range from 4 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
