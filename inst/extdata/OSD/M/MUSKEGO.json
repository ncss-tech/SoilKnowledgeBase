Some pedons contain fragments of twigs, branches, or logs that range from 0.3 to 13 cm (1/8 to 5 inches) in diameter and amount to less than 15 percent of the volume.\nReaction: moderately acid to neutral in the surface tier and neutral to moderately alkaline in the subsurface and bottom tiers (0.01 M calcium chloride); strongly acid to neutral in the  surface tier and from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the subsurface and bottom tiers (water, 1:1).\nSpecial features: silty clay loam overwash, clay loam substratum, firm substratum (dense till), coarse-loamy substratum, marshy (ponded), and flooded phases are recognized in some places.\nSurface tier:\nHue: 10YR, 7.5YR or N\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 0 to 2\nTexture: muck (sapric material)\nSubsurface and bottom tiers (herbaceous organic part):\nHue: 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR or N\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 0 to 4\nTexture: dominantly muck (sapric material), but some pedons have layers of mucky peat (hemic material) up to 10 inches thick.\nLco horizon:\nHue: 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or 5GY\nValue: 2 to 4\nChroma: 1 to 3\nTexture: coprogenous material\nFragment content: up to 10 percent shell fragments\nReaction: neutral to moderately alkaline and carbonates are present in some pedons.\nOther features:\nThe Lco horizon has slightly plastic consistence and shrinks upon drying to form hard clods that are difficult to re-wet."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Maxinkuckee, Moston, Toto, and Wawayanda series. Maxinkuckee and Wawayanda soils have mineral soil material within a depth of 130 cm (51 inches) of the surface. Moston soils have sand below the limnic layer within the 130 cm (51 inches) of control section. Toto soils have marl and sand below the limnic layer within the 130 cm (51 inch) control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Muskego soils commonly are in depressional areas principally associated with glacial lake plains, flood plains, and till plains, but other geographical locations are not excluded. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in herbaceous organic material dominantly from grasses, sedges, and reeds over coprogenous limnic material (sedimentary peat). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 11.1 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 610 to 1016 mm (24 to 40 inches). The frost free period ranges from about 130 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 207 to 560 meters (679 to 1837 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Caron, Houghton, and Klossner series. Caron soils are on similar positions and consist mostly of hemic material over coprogenous earth. Houghton soils are in nearby areas where the organic deposits are more than 130 cm (51 inches) thick and coprogenous material is not in the lower part of the control section.  Klossner soils are in areas where the coprogenous material is absent and the herbaceous organic material is underlain by loamy mineral material."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is low or negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity moderately high to high (1.41 to 14.11 micrometers per second) or high (14.11 to 42.34 micrometers per second) in the herbaceous sapric material and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the coprogenous material (sedimentary peat). Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the herbaceous sapric material and slow in the coprogenous material (sedimentary peat). Most Muskego soils have an apparent water table from 31 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 31 cm (1 foot) below the surface in most years for much of the period from November to August. Some Muskego soils have an apparent water table from 91 to 31 cm (3 feet to 1 foot) above the surface in most years for much of the period from January to December."
