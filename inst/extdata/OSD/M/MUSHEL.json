  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mushel series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in granitic or metamorphic residuum and/or colluvium with a thin volcanic ash mantle. They are on mountain slopes and ridges. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high and slopes range from 5 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
