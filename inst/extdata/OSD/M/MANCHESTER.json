  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 24 inches.  Rock fragments, mainly rounded pebbles, range from 15 to 50 percent in the solum and from 35 to 70 percent in the substratum.  The weighted average volume of rock fragments from 10 to 40 inches is more than 35 percent.  Unless limed, the soil very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to\n3.  The Ap or A horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction. It has weak granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 8.\nTexture in the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand, loamy fine sand or sandy loam in the upper part of the horizon and loamy fine sand, loamy sand or sand in the lower part of the horizon.  Sandy loam texture does not extend below a depth of 10 inches.  The Bw horizon has weak granular structure or it is single grain.  Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value and chroma of 3 to 6. The horizon is commonly stratified sand and gravel.  Fine earth texture in individual layers is coarse sand, sand or loamy sand."

Mecosta and Multorpor soils are from\noutside LRRs R and S.\nBonaparte and Mecosta soils are calcareous within a depth of 40 inches. Hinckley and Quonset soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower throughout and have major differences in lithology.  Multorpor soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower throughout and receive 60 inches or more of precipitation annually.  Otisville soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the substratum and formed in materials derived from acid siliceous rocks. Rikers (Tentative) soils have carboliths and\ncoal."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Manchester soils are nearly level to steep soils on terraces, outwash plains, kames, deltas and eskers. Slope ranges from 0 to 45 percent.  The soils formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial materials and stratified drift derived mainly from a red sedimentary rocks and basalt.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 38 to 50 inches and the growing season is 140 to 185 days."

Berlin soils are fine-textured soils on glaciolacustrine terraces.  Cheshire, Holyoke, Ludlow, Menlo, Watchaug, Wethersfield, Wilbraham and Yalesville soils are on nearby till uplands.  Ellington soils are moderately well drained terrace associates.\nHartford soils have a sandy-skeletal particle size control section. Penwood\nsoils have less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout. Raypol, Raynham and Walpole soils are poorly drained soils in low areas."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are forested or in brushy vegetation.  Cleared areas are used for hay, pasture and silage corn. Small areas, mostly irrigated, are used for tobacco, vegetables and nursery stock.  Many areas are in community development.  Common trees are white, red and black oak, gray birch, aspen, white pine and pitch pine.  Gravel is commonly excavated from areas of these soils."

Sandy-skeletal particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches.\n3. Mesic temperature and udic moisture regimes.\n4. Mixed mineralogy.\n5. No diagnostic subsoil horizons - the zone from 9 to 18 inches does not meet the criteria for a cambic horizon (Bw horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
