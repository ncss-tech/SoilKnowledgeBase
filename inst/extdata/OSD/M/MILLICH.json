  "OVERVIEW": "The Millich series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Millich soils are on hills.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
