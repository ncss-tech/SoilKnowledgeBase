The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature from 63 to 68 degrees F.  The soil contains 40 to 60 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The particle-size control section is silt loam that contains less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and between 3 and 3.5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and is strongly calcareous or very strongly calcareous.  It contains from 1.5 to 3.5 percent organic matter.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR of 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry and 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Millville soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from dolomitic limestone.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches, mean annual temperature if 47 to 49 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 68 to 72 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 140 to 160 days."
