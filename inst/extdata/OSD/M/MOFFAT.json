  "OVERVIEW": "The Moffat series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in eolian and alluvial sediments. These soils are on plains, plains on structural benches, and alluvial fans and have slopes ranging from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 51 degrees and average annual precipitation is 7 inches.",

Kinan soils have stratifications at 20 to 40 inches.  Bluechief soils have bedrock at depths of 30 to 40 inches. Kaito, Pagina, and Nakai soils have a paralithic contacts. Nakai and Nakoy soils have a calcic horizon with its upper boundary below 20 inches.  Boreham, Nakoy, Nolava, Riemod, Teabrush, and Trook soils have soil temperature less than 52 degrees F.  Boreham, Hiko Springs, McCutchen, Nolava, Riemod, and Trook soils have 7.5YR hue or yellower. McCutchen soils also have a lithologic discontinuity at depths below 40 inches. Nuahs soils have hue of 10YR. Hiko Springs, McCutchen, and Nuahs soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRAs 28A, 28B, 29) and have precipitation more evenly distributed throughout the year. Nakai, Nakoy and Teabrush soils have a cambic horizon."
