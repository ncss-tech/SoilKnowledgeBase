Kinan soils have stratifications at 20 to 40 inches.  Bluechief soils have bedrock at depths of 30 to 40 inches. Kaito, Pagina, and Nakai soils have a paralithic contacts. Nakai and Nakoy soils have a calcic horizon with its upper boundary below 20 inches.  Boreham, Nakoy, Nolava, Riemod, Teabrush, and Trook soils have soil temperature less than 52 degrees F.  Boreham, Hiko Springs, McCutchen, Nolava, Riemod, and Trook soils have 7.5YR hue or yellower. McCutchen soils also have a lithologic discontinuity at depths below 40 inches. Nuahs soils have hue of 10YR. Hiko Springs, McCutchen, and Nuahs soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRAs 28A, 28B, 29) and have precipitation more evenly distributed throughout the year. Nakai, Nakoy and Teabrush soils have a cambic horizon."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Moffat soils are on broad alluvial fan benches, plains on structural benches, and plains. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. The soils formed in eolian and alluvial sediments derived mainly from sandstone of the Entrada, Carmel and Navajo Formations. Elevation is 3,500 to 5,900 feet. The average annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F. The freeze-free period is 115 to 190 days."

Moffat is a Typic aridic soil. Chroder is an ustic aridic soil.
