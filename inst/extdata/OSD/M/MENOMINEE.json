    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Menominee soils are on ground moraines, end moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 12 to 70 percent. These soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits over loamy till or lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation is 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.2 degrees C (41 to 45 degrees F). Frost-free period is 100 to 150 days. Elevation is 183 to 427 meters (600 to 1400 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Iosco and poorly drained or very poorly drained Brevort soils are on lower landscape positions on the landscape and form a drainage sequence with the Menominee soils. Rubicon and Kalkaska soils are sandy throughout and are on similar landscape positions. Manistee soils are clayey in the lower part and are on similar landscape positions. Ubly soils are loamy throughout and are on similar landscape positions. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Breckenridge and Sims soils are nearby in narrow drainageways on ground moraines in lower lying areas."
