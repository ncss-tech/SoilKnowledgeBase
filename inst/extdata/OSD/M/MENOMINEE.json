  "OVERVIEW": "The Menominee series consists of very deep, well drained soils on ground moraines, end moraines, outwash plains, and lake plains. The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits over loamy till or lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 6 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).",

The somewhat poorly drained Iosco and poorly drained or very poorly drained Brevort soils are on lower landscape positions on the landscape and form a drainage sequence with the Menominee soils. Rubicon and Kalkaska soils are sandy throughout and are on similar landscape positions. Manistee soils are clayey in the lower part and are on similar landscape positions. Ubly soils are loamy throughout and are on similar landscape positions. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Breckenridge and Sims soils are nearby in narrow drainageways on ground moraines in lower lying areas."
