  "OVERVIEW": "The Maskell series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy alluvial-colluvial material on terraces and foot slopes.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to calcium carbonates range from 40 to 60 or more inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 30 to 60 inches or more in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, clay loam or sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has crushed hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  The upper part is sandy loam, loam, or clay loam while the lower part is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  The average clay content in the control section ranges from 24 to 32 percent.  Buried soils between a depth of 24 and 40 inches are typical where these soils are on terraces or alluvial fans.  Buried soils are rare where these soils are on foot slopes along upland drains."

Similar soils are the Alcester, Blendon, Judson, Hobbs, Olmitz and Spillville soils.  The Bon, Humbarger, Manzano, Shanta, St. Onge and Umbarg soils are calcareous in some part of the control section.  The Frazwell, Lynx, Manzano and Shanta soils are dry in the soil moisture conrol section for longer periods.  The Draper and Pack soils are saturated with water within a depth of 40 inches.  Merrick soils are saturated with water at a depth of 4 to 6 feet from November to June. The Alcester, Judson, and Hobbs soils are fine silty.  The Blendon soils are coarse-loamy.  The Olmitz and Spillville soils have a wetter climate."

The slope gradient is 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in alluvial-colluvial material, derived from sandy glacial outwash and loess.  The annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches, and the annual temperature ranges from 49 to 51 degrees F."
