Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils developed in loamy alluvium derived from igneous materials.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 66 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 160 to 220 days and elevations range from 3,800 to 6,695 feet."

Boracho and Espy soils have a petrocalcic horizon at depths less than 20 inches and are in similar and lower positions.  Brewster soils are shallow over igneous bedrock and are in higher positions.  Rockhouse soils are in the sandy-skeletal family and are in similar positions."
