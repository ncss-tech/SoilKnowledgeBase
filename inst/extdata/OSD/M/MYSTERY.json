    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on gently sloping alluvial fans, low terraces, and fan remnants, and have slopes of 2 to 9 percent. Elevations are 2 to 205 meters (5 to 670 feet). These soils form in alluvium derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1520 to 1900 millimeters (60 to 75 inches). Mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 13 degree C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).

Arlynda soils have redoximorphic features near the surface and are fine-silty; they have less than 15 percent very fine sand to gravel sized particles in the particle size control section. Bigriver soils do not have redoximorphic features.  Bigtree soils are fine loamy; they have more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section. Arlynda soils are in depressions. Bigriver soils are found below Mystery in depositional areas where the velocity of floodwaters is relatively high, such as natural levee margins close to channels. Bigtree soils are found above Mystery where the velocity of floodwaters is relatively slow."
