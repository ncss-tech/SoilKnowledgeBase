  "OVERVIEW": "The Mystery series consists of very deep, moderately well-drained soils formed in multiple deposits of alluvium derived from mixed sources. Mystery soils are on gently sloping alluvial fans, fan remnants, and low terraces and have slopes 2 to 9 percent. Surface runoff is negligible to low. The mean annual precipitation is 1780 millimeters (70 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Bigriver soils do not have redoximorphic features.  Bigtree soils are fine loamy; they have more than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section. Arlynda soils are in depressions. Bigriver soils are found below Mystery in depositional areas where the velocity of floodwaters is relatively high, such as natural levee margins close to channels.
