Improvement of drainage in this soil has occurred due to levees and other flood control structures on the Sacramento River.  Areas adjacent to river levees have temporary water tables at 3 to 6 feet when water levels in the river are high."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nMollic epipedon -- the zone from the soil surface to about 42 inches (Ap, Bw1, Bw2, Bw3).\nCambic horizon -- the zone from about 42 to 52 inches (BC); a structural cambic.\nThin sections (NSSL 89PO619 R7123) from the Bw2 horizon show some weak grain argillans; PSDA shows no significant increase in clay content from Ap to Bw1 and no significant  increase in the ratio of fine clay to total clay in the profile.  Amount and distribution of fine and very fine sand (as a percent of sand plus silt) in the profile suggest numerous minor lithologic discontinuities.\nPachic subgroup -- organic carbon content decreases regularly with increasing depth and is greater than .6 percent to 51 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon has complete laboratory characterization. NSSL sample number S89CA-011-002 (89P 63).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
