  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is 30 to 60 inches.  Gravel of mixed lithology and dominated by shale typically comprise 2 to 8 percent of the volume of the profile.  Some pedons lack gravel in the upper sediments.  Shale is the major component of the sand fraction and makes up 2 to 8 percent of the rock fragments.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 22 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a thin E horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. The A and E horizons range from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Distinct or prominent Fe concentrations are in some to all subhorizons of the B horizon.  It is typically clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay, but ranges to loam in the lower part.  The upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon typically averages between 38 and 45 percent clay with an extreme range of 35 to 50 percent and from 15 to 35 percent fine sand and coarser.  Reaction in the upper part of the B horizon ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid, and from strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.  Some pedons have a thin BC horizon.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline.\nA C horizon is present in some pedons."

The Clarinda, Coatsburg and Terrabella soils lack free carbonates in the series control section.  Chancellor soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick.  Crossplain soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 54 degrees F.  Edinburg, Haig, Minnetonka, Virden and Worthing soils do not have rock fragments in the particle size control section.  Sampsel soils have soft shale bedrock at depths of 40 to 80 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mazaska soils are on plane to slightly concave slopes on broad level ridge tops in rolling moraine areas, or on lower lying areas on moraines.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in clayey glacial till or flow till containing appreciable amounts of shale that mantles loam or clay loam till at 3 to 10 feet or more.  These sediments are Late Wisconsinan in age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 145 to 170.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1600 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Erin, Kilkenny, Lerdal, and Shields soils.  These soils formed in materials that are somewhat similar to those of the Mazaska soils.  The moderately well drained Kilkenny and Erin soils are on undulating to rolling slopes.  The somewhat poorly drained Lerdal, and somewhat poorly drained Shields soils are on nearly level but more elevated positions."
