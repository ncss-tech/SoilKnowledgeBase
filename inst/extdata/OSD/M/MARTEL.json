The very poorly and poorly drained Eaton soils are on similar to higher positions, have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness, do not have an umbric epipedon, and have an albic horizon.  The poorly drained Emeralda, Eureka, and Paisley soils are on slightly higher positions and do not have umbric epipedons.  In addition, Emeralda soils have Mollic epipedons, while Eureka and Paisley soils have albic horizons and mixed mineralogy in the control section."
