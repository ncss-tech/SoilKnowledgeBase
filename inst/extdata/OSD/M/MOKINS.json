  "OVERVIEW": "The Mokins series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of loess and volcanic ash over glaciolacustrine sediments. Mokins soils are on glaciolacustrine terraces and have slopes of 5 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
