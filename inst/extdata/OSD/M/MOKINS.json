    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil between depths of 6 and 16 inches becomes moist in early November and stays moist until late July or early August. The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 or more than 60 inches thick. Average annual soil temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The solum is neutral to very strongly acid. It contains up to 30 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. This horizon is commonly silt loam but ranges to loam.\nThe Bir horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 3 through 6 dry and moist. It is loam, gravelly silt loam or silt loam.\nThe Eb horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist.\nThe Btb horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 6 through 8 dry and moist. Redox concentrations range from faint to prominent in hue of 7.5YR or 5YR. Clay films range from faint to prominent and have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 8. This horizon is silty clay loam or silty clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay."

The soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments mantled with volcanic ash and loess. The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches. The average January temperature is 20 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 59 degrees F. The average annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free season is 80 to 100 days."
