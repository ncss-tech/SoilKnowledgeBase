  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 35 to 55 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments, including up to 5 percent that are greater than 3 inches, range from 5 to 35 percent in the upper part of the solum and 20 to 35 percent in the lower part of the solum. Rock fragments, including up to 15 percent that are greater than 3 inches, range from 25 to 70 percent in the substratum. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A and B horizons and strongly acid to moderately acid in the 2C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR and 7. 5YR, value of 3, 4, or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. The dry color value is 6 or more. The fine earth texture is loam or silt loam. Structure is weak or moderate fine granular and consistence is friable  or very friable. Some pedons have a thin A and/or BA horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4, 5, or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. The fine earth texture is silt loam,  loam, or very fine sandy loam in the lower part. Structure is weak fine granular or weak or moderate fine or medium subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue, value and chroma similar to the B.  Fine earth texture is sandy loam through loam. Consistence is friable or firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Valois series is the only competing series in the same family. Valois soils have a hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the B and C horizon. The Brookfield, Buladean, Cardigan, Chadakoin, Charlton, Chatfield, Cheshire, Delaware (T), Ditney, Dutchess, Fedscreek, Foresthills (T), Greenbelt (T), Hazel, Lordstown, Marrowbone, Maymead, Newport, Pocumtuck (T), Riverhead, Soco, St. Albans, Stecoah, Steinsburg, Stinger, and Yalesville series were in the same family, but have not been classified to the 8th Edition of the Keys To Soil Taxonomy.\nThe Brookfield soils typically have formed in till from micaceous schist and lack crude sorting in the C horizon. Buladean soils have a Cr horizon and have rock fragments dominated by gneiss and granite. Cardigan, Chatfield, Ditney, Hazel, Lordstown, Marrowbone, Steinsburg, Stinger, and Yalesville soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Chadakoin soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower and lack  stratification in the substratum. Charlton soils have 2.5Y to 7.5YR hue in the B horizon and rock fragments dominated by granite, gneiss and schist. Cheshire soils have thinner sola and lack crude sorting in the C horizon. Delaware (T) soils formed in alluvium and have less than 5 percent rock fragments throughout. Dutchess and St. Albans soils are dominated by rock fragments of slate, shale or phyllite. In addition, Dutchess soils typically have bedrock at depths  less than 60 inches and St. Albans soils have a solum thickness of less than  30 inches. Fedscreek soils formed in colluvium from residuum and have thicker substrata. Foresthills (T) and Greenbelt (T) soils are humanly altered soils with surface layers of loamy fill. Maymead soils formed in colluvium and have bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Newport soils have dense till substrata and hues of 2.5Y or 5Y. Riverhead soils have a stratified sand and  gravel C horizon within a depth of 40 inches. Soco and Stecoah soils have a Cr horizon and have rock fragments dominated by metasedimentary rock including phylitte, slate, and metasedimentary sandstone\nLackawanna and Wellsboro series are similar soils in related families. Both soils have a fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maplecrest soils are typically on complex slopes characteristic of end or lateral moraines or along lower valley side slopes where the processes of solifluction have resulted in accumulations of loose till material overlying stratified outwash or poorly sorted ice contact deposits. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent in gradient. The till is dominated by material from reddish  sandstone and siltstone or shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from  46 to 52 degrees F, annual precipitation from 47 to 52 inches and  growing season from 120 to 160 days."

Lackwanna, Wellsboro, and Morris soils have a fragipan; Wellsboro and Morris are wetter than Maplecrest soils. Tunkhannock soils formed in outwash and have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Oquaga is 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock. Barbour is an alluvial soil and has a contrasting sand and gravel substratum within 40 inches. Cadosia soils average more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section."
