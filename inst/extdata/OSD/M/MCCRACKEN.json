Elevations range from 4,350 to 4,760 feet (1,325 To 1,450 meters). Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms from July to September and as and gentle rains and snowfall during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit (12.2 to 13.9 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."

Tohona soils are fine vertic, and are moderately deep to shale with natric and gypsic horizons on pediments.  Sheppard soils have a sandy particle size control section, and are very deep eolian sand deposits on structural benches and terraces.  Somorent soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section on pediments."
