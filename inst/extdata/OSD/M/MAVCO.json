  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches. The soil is calcareous in all horizons. Calcium carbonate equivalent averages 20 to 40 percent in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. When values are less than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick. It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 3 or 4. The 10- to 40-inch control section is clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay with a clay content of 35 to 45 percent. An estimated 10 to 25 percent of the clay is carbonate clay.\nColor of the Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 3 or 4. Secondary calcium carbonate in the form of soft bodies or concretions ranges from about 5 to 50 percent by volume."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mavco soils occur on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces and uplands. Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent but are mainly less than 1.5 percent. The soil formed in alluvium from limestone and is high in calcium carbonate. The climate is hot and semiarid. Average annual precipitation is 17 to 24 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 70 to 74 degrees F. Frost free period is 270 to 290 days, and elevation ranges from 600 to 850 feet. The Thornthwaite P-E indices range from about 21 to 28."
