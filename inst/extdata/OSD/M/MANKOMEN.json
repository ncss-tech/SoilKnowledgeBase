The particle size control section is sandy.\nThe O horizons have a reaction of moderately acid or slightly acid\nThe Cg and Cg/O horizons are separated into their respective parts; the Cg part has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY; value moist of 2, 3, or 4; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand.  The O part (when present) has value moist of 2 or 3; chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is muck or mucky peat.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent gravel.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.  Mottles (when present) have hue 5Y or 5GY; chroma moist of 3 or 4; chroma of 1, or 2\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value moist of 2, 3, or 4; chroma moist of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sandy, loamy sand, and sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent gravel.  Reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline."
