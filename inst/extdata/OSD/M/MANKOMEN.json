  "OVERVIEW": "The Mankomen series consists of very shallow or shallow over permafrost, very poorly or poorly drained soils formed in sandy lacustrine strandline deposits.  Mankomen soils are on lacustrine terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or sand.  The O part (when present) has value moist of 2 or 3; chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is muck or mucky peat.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent gravel.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.
