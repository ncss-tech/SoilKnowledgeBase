  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 20 inches and corresponds to the depth to sand and gravel.  Content of gravel in the control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent by volume and ranges from 35 to 85 percent in the underlying material.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 12 inches and extends into the B2t horizon.  Pedons that have B2t horizons less than 8 inches thick have B3 or B3ca horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is gravelly loam or loam and contains 5 to 35 percent by volume of gravel.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, it is gravelly clay loam or gravelly loam but is loam or clay loam in the upper part of some pedons.   The fine earth fraction averages between 22 and 35 percent clay.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Carbonates are as accumulations and as coatings on the undersides of pebbles. Some pedons have BC horizons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The 2C horizons are gravelly sand, gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly sand, or very gravelly loamy sand, and commonly are stratified and crossbedded.  They are slightly or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Irock, Majada, Mokiak, Montoso, Nederland, Salas, and Willowman soils in the same family. Irock soils are underlain by igneous rock at depths between 42 and 60 inches and contain more sand in the control section.  Majada soils have sola thicker than 20 inches.  Mokiak soils have a lithic contact at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Montoso soils have redder hue, control sections dominated by cinders, and have a calcic horizon.  Nederland soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the argillic and C horizons.  Willowman soils contain more clay and silt in the lower part.  Salas soils have schist bedrock at depths between 20 and 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Murdo soils are nearly level to steep and on ridges of broad outwash plains and high terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Surfaces are convex and generally short and irregular. The soil formed in loamy alluvium deposited over sand and gravel. These deposits are remnants of old stream terraces that have been dissected and truncated.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 21 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F."

Altvan soils are fine-loamy in the upper part in the solum and have sand and gravel at depths between 20 and 40 inches.  Schamber soils do not have an argillic horizon. Altvan and Schamber soils are on positions similar to the Murdo soils. Kyle, Pierre, and Samsil are clayey and are below the Murdo soils in the landscape."
