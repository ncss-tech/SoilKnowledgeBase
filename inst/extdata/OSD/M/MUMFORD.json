  "OVERVIEW": "The Mumford series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and alluvium from limestone with some loess influence.  They are on ridges and hillsides.  Permeability is moderate.  Mumford soils have slopes of 1 to 70 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 15 inches and average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
