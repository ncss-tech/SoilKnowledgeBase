  "OVERVIEW": "The Marmot series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and till over residuum derived from metamorphic rock. The Marmot soils are on structural benches of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 865 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
