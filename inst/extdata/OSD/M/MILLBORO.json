  "OVERVIEW": "The Millboro series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed from clayey sediments weathered from marine shale of the Pierre Shale Formation.  Millboro soils are on undulating upland plains in the Northern and Southern Rolling Pierre Shale Plains, MLRA's 63A and 63B.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 millimeters (18 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",
