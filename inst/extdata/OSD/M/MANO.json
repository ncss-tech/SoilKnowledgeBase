  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mano series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on hills.  These soils formed in colluvial sediments from cherty limestone and the underlying residuum from cherty dolomite.  Slopes range from 1 to 50 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",
