  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Martinson soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from tuff.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 6,000 to 7,300 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches, mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."

Mosquet and Ninemile soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Newlands soils are fine-loamy, deep to lithic contacts, and have a cryic temperature regime."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision of March 2001 updates the taxonomic classification from Fine, smectitic Natric Cryoborolls.  A natric horizon is not present and mean summer soil temperatures are in the range of the frigid temperature regime.  The presence of vitrandic intergrade properties and the volcanic glass content is estimated from similar soils in MLRA 23.  This series may need a new type location and further revision in concept when the Sheldon National Wildlife Refuge is mapped in future years.  The series should be dropped if it is not eventually used in a correlated soil survey.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 12 inches (A1, A2, A3, and Bt1 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from the soil surface to 7 inches (A1, A2, and A3 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 7 to 24 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Btss horizons).\nSlickensides - The zone from 18 to 24 inches (Btss horizon).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 24 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 7 to 24 inches (Bt1, Bt2, and Btss horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
