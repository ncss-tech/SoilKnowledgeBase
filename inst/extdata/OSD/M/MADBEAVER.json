  "OVERVIEW": "The Madbeaver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
