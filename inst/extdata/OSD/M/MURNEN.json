    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 25 inches thick. These soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and apparent clay of 18 to 27 percent.  These soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A and AB horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chromas of 1 through 3 moist, 2 through 4 dry.  They have 0 to 10 percent pebble-size basalt fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent pebble-size basalt fragments."

Hyas soils have 20 to 35 percent hard rock fragments and 15 to 40 percent weathered pebbles in the particle-size control section.  Jonas soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Lates soils are underlain by basalt at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Murtip soils are 40 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in material weathered from basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Winters are mild and moist and summers are cool and dry.  Average annual precipitation is 80 to 120 inches, 60 to 100 inches in Oregon.  Average January temperature is about 28 degrees F., average July temperature is about 59 degrees F, average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, and the growing season (28 degrees F) is 150 to 180 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification only updated 3/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  This description reflects a change in classification based on amendment 16. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 16 inches and a cambic horizon from 16 to 60 inches.  These soils have andic soil properties in the particle-size control section except that the bulk density is assumed to be 0.90 to 1.00 g/cc.  If bulk density is less than 0.90 g/cc these soils are Medial, frigid Alic Fulvudands.\nThe Murnen soil recognized in Columbia County, Oregon is 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and will be correlated to Murtip when the MLRA 1 update is activated.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
