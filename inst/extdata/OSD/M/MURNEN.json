  "OVERVIEW": "The Murnen series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash. Murnen soils are on mountains at elevations of 1,500 to 2,800 feet and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 100 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degree F.",

These soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 0 to 15 percent rock fragments and apparent clay of 18 to 27 percent.  These soils are strongly acid or very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A and AB horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chromas of 1 through 3 moist, 2 through 4 dry.  They have 0 to 10 percent pebble-size basalt fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist or dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent pebble-size basalt fragments."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification only updated 3/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.  This description reflects a change in classification based on amendment 16. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 16 inches and a cambic horizon from 16 to 60 inches.  These soils have andic soil properties in the particle-size control section except that the bulk density is assumed to be 0.90 to 1.00 g/cc.  If bulk density is less than 0.90 g/cc these soils are Medial, frigid Alic Fulvudands.\nThe Murnen soil recognized in Columbia County, Oregon is 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and will be correlated to Murtip when the MLRA 1 update is activated."
