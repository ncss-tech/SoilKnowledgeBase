  "OVERVIEW": "The McLean series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey lacustrine deposits of Quaternary age. These nearly level soils are on the floor of playas 1.5 to 23 m (5 to 75 ft) below the surrounding plain and range in size from a few acres to more than 200 acres. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
