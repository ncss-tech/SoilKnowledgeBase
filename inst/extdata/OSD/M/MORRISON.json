  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Depth to sandstone bedrock is more than 6 feet.  Sandstone, chert or quartzite rock fragments, mostly 1 to 6 inches in size, range from 2 to 20 percent in the A and upper B horizons, increasing to 40 percent in individual horizons of the lower B and C horizons.   Reaction, where unlimed, ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper part of the solum, and from strongly acid to moderately acid in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 8.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Some subhorizon of the B may have hue of 5YR; the redder colors are most common in the middle B horizon.  Individual horizons of the B are sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Sand content averages more than 40 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is sandy loam or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction."

Of these soils only the Hayter and Neshaminy have sola more than 40 inches thick or average more than 40 percent sand.  Hayter soils have mottles in the B horizon.  Neshaminy soils contain rock fragments dominated by igneous rocks.\nArendtsville, Clymer, Edgemont, Hazleton, Lansdale, Ungers and Vanderlip series are in related families.  Arendtsville soils have hues redder than 7.5YR throughout the B horizon.  Clymer, Edgemont, Lansdale and Ungers soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Hazleton soils do not have Bt horizons and have more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Vanderlip soils have loamy sand B horizons."
