  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mooseline soils are on linear or convex surfaces of till plains and moraines. They formed in a 20 to 40 inch mantle of sandy outwash or eolian sediments and underlying fine, dense till deposited by the St. Louis sublobe of late Wisconsin age. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches. The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days. Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1600 feet."

The moderately well drained Hibbing, somewhat poorly drained Buhl, poorly drained McQuade and the very poorly drained Fayal soils form a hydrosequence and do not have coarse-textured mantles. The very poorly drained Daisybay and Dora soils formed in organic materials over till. The very poorly drained Rifle soils are in depressions and formed in organic materials."
