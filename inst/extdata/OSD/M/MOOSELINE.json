  "OVERVIEW": "The Mooseline series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a mantle of outwash or eolian material and underlying fine, dense till. They are on till plains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid in the upper part and very slow in the underlying till. Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",
