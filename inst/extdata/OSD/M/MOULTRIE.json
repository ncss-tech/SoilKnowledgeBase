  "OVERVIEW": "The Moultrie series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, rapidly permeable soils in tidal marshes along the Atlantic Coast in Peninsular Florida.  They formed in thick deposits of sandy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.",

The water table is within 10 inches of the surface most of the time and is affected by tidal fluctuations.\nThis series was formerly mapped as a variant of the Basinger series.
