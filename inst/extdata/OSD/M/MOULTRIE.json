Reaction of the Bh, Bw, and Cg horizons range from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Sulfur content is less than 0.75 percent throughout the soil.  Conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from about 16 to 35 mmho/cm throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3.  Where value is 3 or less, thickness is less than 6 inches.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features and streaks of black, gray, brown, olive, and greenish gray range from none to many.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Uncoated sand grains range from common to many.  Areas of organic matter depletions with colors similar to that of the E horizon range from few to many.

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon  the zone from 0 to 22 inches (Ap, E1, and E2 horizons).\nWeak spodic horizon  the zone from 22 to 29 inches (Bh1 and Bh2 horizons).\nMoultrie soils are frequently flooded by storm tides and when other conditions cause abnormally high tides.  The water table is within 10 inches of the surface most of the time and is affected by tidal fluctuations.\nThis series was formerly mapped as a variant of the Basinger series.  This series has halic properties as defined in Application of Soil Taxonomy in Tidal Areas of the Southeastern United States, Soil Science Society of America Proceedings, Vol. 39; 1975.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
