  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 45 inches. Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent by volume in individual horizons within a depth of 40 inches and 0 to 50 percent below 40 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky structure. It is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid, and where limed can range to neutral. Depth of the A horizon ranges from 2 to 5 inches.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. High chroma redoximorphic features can occur in all subhorizons. Low chroma redoximorphic features occur in the lower B horizons within 24 inches of the soil surface. The B horizon ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam and include very fine sandy loam. Individual subhorizons can be gravely. It has weak or moderate, subangular blocky or prismatic structure. It is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. There are common to many high and low chroma redoximorphic features. The C horizon ranges from fine sandy loam to silt loam in the fine earth fraction above a depth of 40 inches, but includes stratified sand and gravel below depths of 40 inches. Consistence is very friable to firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Beckville series are the only other series in the same family. Beckville soils have carbonates between 20 to 40 inches from the soil surface.\nThe Basher, Hamlin, Lobdell, Oldenburg, Philo, Pope, Teel, Tioga, Weaver, Waterford, and Winooski series are similar soils in related families. Basher and Philo soils have less than 60 percent base saturation within 30 inches of the soil surface. Hamlin soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections and lack 2 chroma redoximorphic features within 24 inches. Lobdell and Weaver soils have fine-loamy particle-size control sections. The Oldenburg soils have a mean annual temperature of 53 degrees F or greater. Pope soils have less than 60 percent base saturation within 30 inches, and lack 2 chroma redoximorphic features within 24 inches. Teel and Winooski soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections. Tioga soils lack 2 chroma redoximorphic features within 24 inches of the soil surface. Waterford soils are somewhat poorly drained and have free calcium carbonates in the lower part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Middlebury soils are level and nearly level soils on flood plains and second bottomlands, and on some alluvial fans in sites where water tables are high part of the year. The soils formed in post glacial alluvium predominantly from areas of shale and sandstone with some lime bearing material. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 39 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 51 degrees F.; mean frost free season ranges from 120 to 170 days."

Chenango, Howard, and Palmyra soils formed in adjacent gravelly outwash deposits on terraces. Wayland soils are poorly drained and very poorly drained, and formed in silty alluvium."
