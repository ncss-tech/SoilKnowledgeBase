  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Montecito soils are on mesas, hills, lava plains, and old alluvial terraces that are several hundred feet thick.  Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 7,800 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is typically 14 to 16 inches but ranges to 12 in some areas with a large portion occurring as late summer thunderstorms.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."
