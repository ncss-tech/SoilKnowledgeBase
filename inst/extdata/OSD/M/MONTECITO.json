  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Montecito series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium and eolian material derived dominantly from basalt, sandstone and shale.  Montecito soils are on alluvial terraces, lava plains, hills and mesas and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
