Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the solum and 20 to 45 percent in the substratum.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and 1 to 10 percent in the substratum.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue or 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loamy sand or sand.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loamy sand, sand, or the gravelly analogs of these textures.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is gravelly sand or very gravelly sand.

Chinwhisker, Eauclaire, Halfaday and Manitowish soils do not contain free carbonates within a depth of 60 inches, in addition Chinwhisker and Halfaday contain less than 15 percent rockfragments.  Croswell, Croswood, and Cublake soils do not have textures of sandy loam or fine sandy loam within the upper 15 inches of the series control section and contain less than 15 percent of rock fragments in the C horizon.  Gilchrist 2C horizons in calcareous coarse-loamy glacial till.   Heinz soils are saturated with a zone from 2 to 3.5 feet below the surface at some time during the period from October to May."
