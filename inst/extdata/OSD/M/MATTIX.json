  "OVERVIEW": "The Mattix series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial deposits overlying sand and gravel outwash on outwash plains and ground moraines.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the loamy part and very rapid in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
