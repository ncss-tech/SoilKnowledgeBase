  "OVERVIEW": "The Matquaw series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  Matquaw soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
