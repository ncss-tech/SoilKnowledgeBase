    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. Concretions and/or coatings of iron and manganese oxides range from none to common throughout the profile. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout the profile.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It has few or common redox accumulations in shades of brown and red, and/or redox depletions in shades of gray and brown. Texture is clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe lower part of the Bw horizon has a similar range in color as the upper part, or it lacks a dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of brown and gray. It has common or many redox accumulations in shades of brown and red, and/or redox depletions in shades of gray and brown. Texture is clay loam, loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon, if it occurs, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has few to many redox accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, or red. Texture is clay loam, loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon, if it occurs, is multicolored in shades of brown and gray. It has common or many redox accumulations in shades of brown or red, and redox depletions in shades of brown or gray. Texture is loam, sandy loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay. Thin strata of finer and/or coarser textures occur in many pedons.\nThe Cg horizon, if it occurs, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mooreville soils are on flood plains of streams draining areas of the Southern Coastal Plain and the Blackland Prairie. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in loamy alluvium. The climate is warm and humid. Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 63 degrees Fahrenheit, and the mean annual precipitation is 53 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Iuka, Jena, Kirkville, Mantachie, Riverview, Una, and Urbo series. The coarse-loamy Iuka, Jena, and Kirkville soils are in slightly higher positions on natural levees. The somewhat poorly drained Mantachie soils are in slightly lower, less convex positions than those of the Mooreville soils. The well drained Riverview soils are in slightly higher, more convex positions than those of the Mooreville soils. The poorly drained Una and the somewhat poorly drained Urbo soils are fine-textured and are in lower positions than those of the Mooreville soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Mooreville soils are moderately well drained. Runoff is slow, and permeability is moderate. These soils are flooded occasionally or frequently for brief to long periods unless protected. The soil is wet in all layers below a depth of 18 to 36 inches during the winter and early spring months in normal years."
