  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 18 inches (Ap, A and Btg1 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 14 inches to 24 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizon); aquic condition - based on 2 chroma matrix with high chroma redox concentrations below the mollic epipedon.\nThe type location is from Wilkin County to better represent the series concept within MLRA-56.  This soil will replace the Lindaas series in Wilkin County on the lake plain in the future.\nThe reference to geogenetic fractures in the C horizon is an attempt to recognize the \"rebound\" fractures commonly associated with glacial till.   In the past these fractures were called platy-like structure, soil fragments, etc.  The term geogenetic is closer to the actual features and tell the user additional information about water movement, carbonate precipitation, etc."
