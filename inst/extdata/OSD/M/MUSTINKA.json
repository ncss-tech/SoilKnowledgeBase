Some pedons do not have gypsum.  The thickness of the upper mantle is 20 to 50 inches.  The upper mantle typically does not have rock fragments and the underlying glacial till has 1 to 8 percent rock fragments mostly gravel size.  Linear extensibility is less than 6 cm in the upper meter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - The zone from the surface to a depth of 18 inches (Ap, A and Btg1 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 14 inches to 24 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizon); aquic condition - based on 2 chroma matrix with high chroma redox concentrations below the mollic epipedon.\nThe type location is from Wilkin County to better represent the series concept within MLRA-56.  This soil will replace the Lindaas series in Wilkin County on the lake plain in the future.\nThe reference to geogenetic fractures in the C horizon is an attempt to recognize the \"rebound\" fractures commonly associated with glacial till.   In the past these fractures were called platy-like structure, soil fragments, etc.  The term geogenetic is closer to the actual features and tell the user additional information about water movement, carbonate precipitation, etc.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil Interpretation Record number MN0723\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
