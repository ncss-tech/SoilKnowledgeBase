The dry period is in the fall, winter, and early spring. Typic aridic moisture regime.\nThe mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 to 72 degrees F.\nReaction: Slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nSodicity: slight to strongly affected\nControl section: Typically silty clay loam but it ranges from silt loam to clay loam containing less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.\nClay content: 18 to 35 percent clay.\nA horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  3 to 7 dry, 2 to 6 moist\nChroma:  2 to 4, dry or moist\nAdditional features:  Noneffervescent to slightly effervescent.\nB horizon\nHue:  5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  4 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist\nChroma:  2 to 4, dry or moist\nTexture:  silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, clay loam.\nOther features:  To depth of at least 40 inches it contains less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The calcium carbonate is disseminated in the upper part of the layer, but the lower part contains a few fine threads, veins and soft bodies.\n2Bk horizon\nColors and textures are the same as described for the B horizon, but coarse sand and gravel strata may occur below a depth of 36 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Mercey (CA), Prelo (NM), and Russler (NM) series.  Mercey soils are in the Central California Coast Range (MLRA 15) receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November. Prelo soils contain 3 to 5 percent gypsum in the Bw and 5 to 20 percent in the Bk. Russler soils are 20 to 40 inches to paralithic contact with highly gypsiferous bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mimbres soils are in slight depressions on broad floodplains, and on nearly level, lower parts of long gently sloping alluvial fans that terminate at broad drainageways, stream terraces or valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The elevation is 3,900 to 5,800 feet.  The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days.  The soils formed in medium to moderately fine textured, silty sediments derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks and small amounts of sedimentary rocks.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is 65 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches, and about 2/3 falls between June and the end of October. The Thornthwaite annual P-E Index is 13.  In Arizona elevation ranges as low as 2,000 feet, precipitation as high as 12 inches, air temperature as high as 70 degrees, and frost-free period as long as 280 days."

Mohave soils have an argillic horizon and have a prominent zone of carbonate accumulation below the argillic horizon."
