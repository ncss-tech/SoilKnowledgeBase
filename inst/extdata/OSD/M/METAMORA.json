    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Metamora soils are on lake plains, near-shore zones (relict), till plains, and low moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. The Metamora soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial or lacustrine deposits and the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.7 to 9.6 degrees C (44 to 49 degrees F)."

Metamora soils are in a drainage sequence with the well drained Owosso and poorly drained Corunna soils. They are associated in the landscape with the Blount, Brookston, Conover, and Pewamo soils. These soils do not have the coarser textured A and Bg horizons."

Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 inches) between March and May and in October and November in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is very low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the in the A and Bg horizons and moderately high in the 2Bt and 2C horizons. Permeability is moderately rapid in the A and Bg horizons and moderate or moderately slow in the 2Bt and 2C horizons."

Further evaluation is needed to determine the presence of densic materials in Metamora soils in other MLRAs.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
