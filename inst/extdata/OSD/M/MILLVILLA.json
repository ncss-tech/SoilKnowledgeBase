These soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from phyllite, and schist, and other metasedimentary rocks. Elevation is 225 to 885 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 670 to 1000 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is  13 to 16 degrees C. The frost free season is 190 to 315 days."
