    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mountainview soils are in basins on low terraces and bottomlands.  Elevations range from 1,000 to 4,000 feet.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in decomposing rushes, sedges, reeds, cattails and other water-loving herbaceous plants.  The mineral horizons were formed from mixed alluvium.  The climate is semi-arid or subhumid with mean annual precipitation of 10 to 25 inches and the frost-free period ranges from 100 to 180 days."
