The soils formed in decomposing rushes, sedges, reeds, cattails and other water-loving herbaceous plants.  The mineral horizons were formed from mixed alluvium.  The climate is semi-arid or subhumid with mean annual precipitation of 10 to 25 inches and the frost-free period ranges from 100 to 180 days."
