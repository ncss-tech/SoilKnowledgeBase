  "OVERVIEW": "The Mountainview series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils that formed in residual material from sedges, rushes, and cattails intermixed with mineral layers of medium or moderately coarse textured soil.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Mountainview soils are in basins on low terraces and stream bottoms.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soils formed in decomposing rushes, sedges, reeds, cattails and other water-loving herbaceous plants.  The mineral horizons were formed from mixed alluvium.  The climate is semi-arid or subhumid with mean annual precipitation of 10 to 25 inches and the frost-free period ranges from 100 to 180 days."
