Rock fragments are mostly gravel, channers, cobbles, or stones of metasedimentary rocks range from 0 to 50 percent in the solum but the control section averages less than 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 50 percent below the solum. The soil ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid, unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe BE, BA, or E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam. Lithochromic mottles, if present, are in shades of red, brown, or yellow. Some pedons have hue of 2.5YR and clay texture below about 28 inches.\nThe BC or C horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or possibly clay in areas that have metasiltstone or metashale interbeds. Some pedons have lithochromic mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray. Some pedons have mottled colors with no dominant matrix color.\nThe Cr horizon when present, is soft fractured metasedimentary rock in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.\nThe R horizon is hard metasandstone, arkose, arksoic sandstone, or graywacke in shades of brown, yellow, or gray."

Alonzville, Bailegap, Hambrook, Jefferson, Keener, Lonewood, Marr, Riney, Sassafrass, Shinbone, and Sunnyside soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock. Beersheba are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Lily soils formed in residuum from sedimentary rocks primarily of Pennsylvanian age and contain fragments of those rocks. Gunstock soils formed in residuum from phyllite and are moderately deep to paralithic contact and deep to lithic contact. Harmiller soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and do not have a lithic contact within 60 inches. Raftville soils formed in colluvium and alluvium and contain fragments of chert and sandstone."
