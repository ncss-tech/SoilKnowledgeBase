  "OVERVIEW": "The McCamy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderate or moderately rapid permeability. They formed in residuum affected by soil creep in the upper part, that weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as arkose, arkosic sandstone, quartzite, graywacke, metasiltstone, or metasandstone. These gently sloping to very steep soils are on interfluves and side slopes in the Blue Ridge Mountains (MLRA 130). Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent.",

Alonzville, Bailegap, Hambrook, Jefferson, Keener, Lonewood, Marr, Riney, Sassafrass, Shinbone, and Sunnyside soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock. Beersheba are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Lily soils formed in residuum from sedimentary rocks primarily of Pennsylvanian age and contain fragments of those rocks. Gunstock soils formed in residuum from phyllite and are moderately deep to paralithic contact and deep to lithic contact. Harmiller soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and do not have a lithic contact within 60 inches. Raftville soils formed in colluvium and alluvium and contain fragments of chert and sandstone."
