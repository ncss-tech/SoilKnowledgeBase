The mean annual precipitation 20 to 25 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium surface runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Endosaturation is present with a seasonal high water table between 50 and 76 cm (moderately deep internal free water occurrence class) from January through May.  Cumulative annual duration class is common.  These soils are susceptible to occasional flooding for brief periods between December and May.  Down-cutting of streams and manipulation of the adjacent watershed has altered the natural hydrology in some areas."
