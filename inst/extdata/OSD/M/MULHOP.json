  "OVERVIEW": "The Mulhop series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from dolostone and limestone.  Mulhop soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
