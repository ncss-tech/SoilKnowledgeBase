Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon -the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\nb. Argillic horizon -the zone between 8 and 32 inches (Bt horizon).\nc. Aquic feature -low chroma Fe depletions in the upper 24 inches of the\nargillic horizon (Bt3 horizon).\nSIR = VA0162\nMLRA = 153A, 153B\nREVISED = 2/7/96, MHC; 5/07, DTA\nADDITIONAL DATA: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University soil survey lab data shows the typical pedon of the Munden series to have a base saturation of 19.48 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.\nThe particle-size control section has 15.6 percent clay and 29.8 percent silt as a weighted average.
