  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to fractured and weathered rock ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  Content of rock fragments, commonly gravel, cobbles, and stones, range from 5 to 35 percent in the A and Bt horizons, and from 35 to 50 percent in the BC horizon.  Stones occupy up to 15 percent on and in the surface layer.  The soil is strongly acid to neutral throughout the solum.  Seams of fine-earth material in the Cr horizon are moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10R, value of 3 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 3 and chroma of 4 or 6.  Common to many weathered rock fragments are reddish, brownish, and yellowish.  The Bt horizon is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction\nThe Cr horizon is weathered gneiss or a mixture of gneiss and schist, with common to many hard cobbles and stones.  Fractures are filled with dark red loamy material."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar soils include the Cullen, Enon, Gwinnett, Iredell, Lloyd, Mecklenburg, Mountainburg, Rabun, and Wilkes series.  All of these except Mountainburg and Wilkes soils are more than 20 inches to a paralithic contact.  In addition, Cullen, Enon, Iredell, Mecklenburg, Mountainburg, and Wilkes soils have a Bt horizon with value of 4 or more.  Enon, Gwinnett, Iredell, Lloyd, Mecklenburg, and Rabun soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and Rabun soils have an average annual soil temperature less than 59 degrees F.  Mountainburg soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizons.  Wilkes soils have a Bt horizon less than 10 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are narrow, gently sloping ridgetops and moderate to strong sideslopes of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 2 to 80 percent, but most are less than 25 percent.  Musella soils formed in saprolite weathered from dark-colored rocks high in ferromagnesium minerals.  Rock outcrops and stones are common landscape features.  The mean annual temperature is about 59 to 65 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 45 to 55 inches."
