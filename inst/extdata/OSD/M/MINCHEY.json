  "OVERVIEW": "The Minchey series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone, quartzite and shale.  Minchey soils are on mesas, benches, and old alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
