  "OVERVIEW": "The Meadowcreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. They are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, drainageways, and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The need for documentation in support of the Fluvaquentic subgroup is recognized and should be investigated."
