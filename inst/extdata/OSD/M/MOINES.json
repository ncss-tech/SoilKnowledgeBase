  "OVERVIEW": "The Moines series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in calcareous, loamy till. These soils are slightly convex low knolls on dissected ground moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 4 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.",
