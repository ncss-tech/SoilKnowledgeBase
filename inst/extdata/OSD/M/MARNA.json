  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 24 inches in thickness. Depth to carbonates ranges from 26 to 48 inches. Depth to horizons in loam or clay loam glacial till ranges from 24 to 40 inches. Content of rock fragments in the upper mantle ranges from 0 to 5 percent dominated by soft shale. Rock fragments of mixed lithology range from 2 to 10 percent in the glacial till. The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section averages between 35 and 60 percent clay and between 10 and 30 percent sand.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It is firm to very firm. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 or 2. It has few to many redoximorphic features. It is slightly acid or neutral. It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe 2Bg or 2BCg horizons are loam or clay loam, with color similar to the Bg horizon. They are firm or friable. They are slightly alkaline or neutral.\nThe 2Bkg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam or clay loam. It has bulk density of 1.40 to 1.60 gm/cc. It has 20 to 30 percent clay and 30 to 45 percent sand. It is friable. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. A thin C horizon with texture of silty clay loam, silty clay or clay is within 60 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are in the Cosmos and Waldorf series. When previously classified in the Typic Haplaquolls subgroup, other competing series were Chequest, Kalona, Lanyon, and Streator. Cosmos soils have moist bulk densities greater than 1.6 gm/cc in the lower part of the series control section. Waldorf soils have less than 10 percent sand throughout the series control section. Chequest, Kalona, and Streator soils do not have carbonates within depths of 48 inches. Lanyon soils have carbonates within depths of 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marna soils have slightly concave to slightly convex slopes on lake plains and clayey-mantled ground moraines. Their slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed primarily in 24 to 40 inches of clayey glacial lacustrine sediments and calcareous loamy glacial till. The deposits are late Wisconsinan in age. The climate is humid continental with warm summers and cold winters. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 32 inches. Elevation ranges from 900 to 1200 feet above sea level. Frost-free period ranges from 124 to 172 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Kamrar, Guckeen, Brownton, and Lura soils which are members of a hydrosequence with the Marna soils. The well drained Kamrar and the moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained Guckeen soils are on backslopes, shoulders and summits. The poorly drained calcareous Brownton soils are on nearby low rises and rims of depressions. The very poorly drained Lura soils are in depressions and swales."
