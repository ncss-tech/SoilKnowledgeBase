  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to paralithic contact ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  Depth to continuous accumulations of carbonate is 6 inches or less.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, but are typically less than 5 percent.  EC is 0 to 2 mmhos/cm throughout.  The particle-size control section has less than 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam and in some pedons loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction is slightly to strongly alkaline.  Where the surface layer has a value of 3 moist and 5 dry and a chroma of 3 or less, it is too thin or the organic carbon content is too low to be a mollic epipedon.  Some pedons have a thin Bw horizon.\nThe AC and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Dark colors are inherent from the parent material.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon is soft calcareous sandstone or interbedded sandstone, mudstone or shale."

Dolcan, Fairburn and Spearfish soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Dolcan soils have more than 20 percent rock fragments in the A horizon and Spearfish soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the C horizon.  Sipapu soils have more than 15 percent pararock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mittenbutte soils occur on hills and ridges.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium or residuum weathered from soft, interbedded sandstone and shale.  Elevation is 3,500 to 5,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, most of which falls in April, May and June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."

Fairburn soils have greater than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Ironbutte soils have porcelanite with 20 inches.  Vonalf and Xema soils have argillic horizons.  The Fairburn, Ironbutte and Xema soils occur on crest and shoulders of hills and ridges.  The Vonalf soils occur on footslopes."
