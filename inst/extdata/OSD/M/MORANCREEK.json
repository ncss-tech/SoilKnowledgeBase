  "OVERVIEW": "The Morancreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift and metasedimentary bedrock.  Morancreek soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slope ranges from 5 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 838 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
