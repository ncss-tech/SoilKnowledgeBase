    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Morancreek soils occur on hillslopes and mountain slopes. Slope ranges from 5 to 25 percent and elevations range from 0 to 732 meters.  These soils formed in colluvium from glacial drift and bedrock of metasedimentary lithology.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 635 to 1,016 millimeters.  The mean annual air temperature is 9 to 10 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 200 to 240 days."

Deadmanbay soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and have a densic contact between 100 and 150 cm. Doebay soils occur on adjacent hillslopes and mountain slopes, have a lithic contact between 50 and 100 cm and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section."
