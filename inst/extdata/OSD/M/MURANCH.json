  "OVERVIEW": "The Muranch Series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on hills and mountains.  These soils formed in material weathered from basalt and have slopes of 30 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The moisture control section between the depths of 6 and 30 inches is moist in some part for at least 90 consecutive days from late December until April and is moist in all parts for 45 consecutive days between mid January and mid March.  The soil is dry in all parts for about 225 days.  The soil temperature is always above 47 degrees F.  Clay content is 20 to 27 percent throughout the profile.  The profile is mildly or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Gravel content is 0 to 5 percent and cobble content is 0 to 5 percent.\nThe B horizon is 10YR 6/3 or 6/4; 7.5YR 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.
