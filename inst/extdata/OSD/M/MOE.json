The soil is usually moist; it is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the summer for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches of more.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 15 to 20 inches thick.  Partially weathered rock fragments range from a few in the upper part of the solum to 35 percent in the lower part.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It has 15 to 35 percent fine concretions and gravel.  It is estimated to have acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half the iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and less than 2.0 cmol per kg fine earth of 1N KCL extractable aluminum.\nThe Bw and BC horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or silty clay and averages 35 to 45 percent clay."

The soils formed in deep fine textured colluvium and residuum weathered dominantly from tuffaceous sandstone, siltstone, and basalt breccia.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 90 inches occurring as rain in the spring and autumn and rain and snow in the winter.  The mean January temperature is about 35 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."
