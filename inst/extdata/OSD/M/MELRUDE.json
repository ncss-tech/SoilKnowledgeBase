Melrude soils formed in stratified glaciofluvial deposits and the underlying till.  The mean annual air temperature is 3 to 5 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is 500 to 762 mm. Annual frost-free days range from 90 to 120 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 300 to 400 meters."

The very poorly drained Baden soils are in closed depressions, swales and on edges of depressions of organic soils. The very poorly drained Cathro soils are organic and are in depressions and basins.  The poorly drained Ellsburg, Hellwig and Schisler soils are on similar landscape positions.   Ellsburg soils were formed in fine-loamy glacial till.  Hellwig and Schisler soils are underlain by fine-loamy till at 102 cm."
