  "OVERVIEW": "The Mayer series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of a loamy mantle and the underlying sandy and gravelly glacial outwash. These soils are on concave or slightly convex positions on glacial outwash plains, till plains, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
