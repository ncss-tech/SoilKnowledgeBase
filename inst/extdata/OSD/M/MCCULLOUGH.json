  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bitterwater, Corbilt (T), Elkhills, Kimberlina, and Seaman series.  Bitterwater, Elkhills and Kimberlina soils lack the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation during summer convection storms. Bitterwater soils also have a paralithic contact between 50 to 60 inches and lack significant sandy strata in the lower part of the control section.  Corbilt soils contain 15 to 20 percent CaC03 in the control section, and depth to carbonates range from 5 to 20 inches deep, and also contain a Bq horizon that is weakly silica cemented. Seaman soils have a component of volcanic ash and lack significant sand strata in the lower part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McCullough soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, and alluvial flats.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources commonly with a component of gypsiferous materials.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations are 1,900 to 4,800 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches; mean annual temperature is 62 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 170 to 250 days."
