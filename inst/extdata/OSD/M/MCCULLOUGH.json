  "OVERVIEW": "The McCullough series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  The McCullough soils are on inset fans, fan skirts and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F.",

Bitterwater, Elkhills and Kimberlina soils lack the 10 to 20 days of summer precipitation during summer convection storms. Bitterwater soils also have a paralithic contact between 50 to 60 inches and lack significant sandy strata in the lower part of the control section.  Corbilt soils contain 15 to 20 percent CaC03 in the control section, and depth to carbonates range from 5 to 20 inches deep, and also contain a Bq horizon that is weakly silica cemented. Seaman soils have a component of volcanic ash and lack significant sand strata in the lower part of the control section."
