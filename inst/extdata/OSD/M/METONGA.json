  "OVERVIEW": "The Metonga series consists of well drained soils which are moderately deep to a lithic contact with fractured igneous or metamorphic bedrock.  These soils formed in a silty or loamy eolian mantle, or in the eolian mantle and and in loamy till underlain by igneous or metamorphic bedrock on moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and very slow to rapid in the bedrock.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

Thickness of the silty or loamy eolian mantle ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  Volume of rock fragments is less than 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the eolian mantle and from 5 to 35 percent in the till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the eolian mantle and from 0 to 10 percent in the till.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid to slightly acid below the spodic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10 YR; value of 2 to 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 to 3.  The A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 and 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. It is present in 50 percent or more of each uncultivated pedon.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon, less than 3 inches thick, with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It has texture like the Bhs horizon above or is sandy loam.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 3R horizon is fractured igneous or metamorphic bedrock.  Fractures are more than 4 inches apart."
