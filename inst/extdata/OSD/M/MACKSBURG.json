Macksburg and Mahaska soils are quite similar but are separated geographically. Available data does not confirm differences in solum thickness or depth to clay maximum but does tend to indicate differences in depth to silt loam textures and in potassium. The properties of Macksburg, Arisburg, and Arispe soils are also similar. Arisburg and Arispe series are described as having a perched water table while Macksburg series has an apparent water table.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--Iowa State University, Ames Iowa\nLaboratory data--Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska, User Pedon IDs 61IA001001, 61IA121001, 85MO159001, and 94IA181003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
