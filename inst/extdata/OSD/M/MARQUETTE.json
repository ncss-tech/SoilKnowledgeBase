  "OVERVIEW": "The Marquette series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits of late Wisconsinan Age.  These soils are on glacial lake beach ridges,outwash plains and glacial moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 640 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
