  "OVERVIEW": "The McKamie series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvial sediments on Pleistocene age stream terraces. These soils are on broad gently sloping to strongly sloping coastal plains. Slope is dominantly 1 to 8 percent but ranges up to 20 percent near escarpments adjacent to drainageways.",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Gladdice and White Store series are in the same family. Similar series are Boswell, Gore, Kolin, Mecklenburg, Morse, and Shubuta. Gladdice soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone. White Store soils are on Piedmont uplands and are underlain by Triassic rocks. Boswell soils have a lower base saturation and more gray iron depletions in the lower part of the B horizon. Gore soils have distinct or prominent redoximorphic features throughout. Kolin soils have intrusions of E material within the B horizon. Mecklenburg soils have lower base saturation. Morse soils are calcareous throughout. Shubuta soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent."

The surface texture was determined to be silty clay loam through additional sampling. The series was also updated in 2004 to add value 5 to the range in characteristics for the Bt and BC horizons, and to allow loamy textures in the lower part of the subsoil below the control section."
