  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Gladdice and White Store series are in the same family. Similar series are Boswell, Gore, Kolin, Mecklenburg, Morse, and Shubuta. Gladdice soils formed in residuum weathered from limestone. White Store soils are on Piedmont uplands and are underlain by Triassic rocks. Boswell soils have a lower base saturation and more gray iron depletions in the lower part of the B horizon. Gore soils have distinct or prominent redoximorphic features throughout. Kolin soils have intrusions of E material within the B horizon. Mecklenburg soils have lower base saturation. Morse soils are calcareous throughout. Shubuta soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep dissected stream terraces of Pleistocene age. Dominant slopes ranges from 1 to 8 percent, but some slopes are as steep as 20 percent. McKamie soils formed in red clayey alluvium most likely washed from Permian red beds and associated sediments. Climate is warm and humid, mean annual precipitation is 48 inches, and mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F. near the type location."

The surface texture was determined to be silty clay loam through additional sampling. The series was also updated in 2004 to add value 5 to the range in characteristics for the Bt and BC horizons, and to allow loamy textures in the lower part of the subsoil below the control section.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
