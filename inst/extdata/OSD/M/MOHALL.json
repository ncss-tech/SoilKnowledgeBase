Harqua and Tucson soils have calcic horizons at depths less than 20 inches. Snaggletooth soils are usually dry throughtout, and are rarely moist during summer or winter and exhibit a calcic horizon below 54 inches. Tremant soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

Elevations are 500 to 3,000 feet (109 to 914 meters). Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches and falls mainly as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rains. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 70 to 76 degrees F (21.1 to 24.4 degrees C). The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days."
