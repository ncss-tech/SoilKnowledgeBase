  "OVERVIEW": "The Marklepass series consists of very deep, well drained, sodium affected soils that formed in clayey alluvium derived from lake sediments.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
