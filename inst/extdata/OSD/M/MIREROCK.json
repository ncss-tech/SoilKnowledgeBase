Rock fragments of gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 35 percent throughout. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 8. It is silt loam or loam. In eroded areas, it is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. It is fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Black to dark browm nodules, concretions, or soft masses are few to many.\nThe C horizon, where present, is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, green, black, and white. It is fine sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam saprolite."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ainsworth, Brevator, Clinton, Hatton, Haymarket, Lunt, and Welda series. The Ainsworth, Clinton, Hatton, and Welda soils dominantly formed in loess and do not have rock fragments of hornblende gneiss, gabbro, diorite, greenstone, or chlorite-amphibole schist. Bonnefemme  soils formed in a thin layer of loess and underlying residuum weathered from limestone. Brevator soils formed in local pedisediment and glacial till and have a lithologic discontinuity.  Haymarket soils are very deep to bedrock. Lunt soils have rock fragments of quartz."

These soils formed in residuum from intrusives such as hornblende gneiss, gabbro, diorite, greenstone, or chlorite-amphibole schist. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 48 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F."

Minnieville soils are very deep, not as plastic, and have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Orenda soils are very deep and have less montmorillonitic clays. Spriggs soils have less clay and are not as plastic."
