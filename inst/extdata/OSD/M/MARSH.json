  "OVERVIEW": "The Marsh series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on uplands.  The soil formed in colluvium or residuum from interbedded sandy limestone, siltstone, and shale.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep, highly dissected back slopes, shoulders, and narrow on ridgecrests.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Content of fragments, dominantly channers of sandy limestone or siltstone, range from 0 to 20 percent in the A horizon, 0 to 35 percent in the B horizon, and 10 to 59 percent in the C horizon.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid, except where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is loam or silt loam, or their channery or gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Some pedons have variegations of parent material in shades of red or brown.  Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  In some pedons, the lower part of the B horizon has texture ranging to clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon variegated colors from parent material in shades of red, brown, olive, or gray.  Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay, or their channery or flaggy analogues.\nThe Cr horizon consists of interbedded sandy limestone, shale, and siltstone.  Some pedons include a few thin strata of hard limestone.  Typically, this horizon can be dug with a spade, except for the hard strata."
