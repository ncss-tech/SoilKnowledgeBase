  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Minneosa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvial sediments. Permeability is moderately rapid. These soils are on low terraces and flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.",

The soil to a depth of 40 inches is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and is calcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 5. Thin strata of sandy loam or fine sandy loam are always present but range in number among pedons and in thickness from about 1/4 to 2 inches.\nThe 2C horizon is absent in some pedons and ranges in thickness from 0 to 24 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Minneosa soils are on low terraces and floodplains along major drainageways. Slopes are usually less than 2 percent but ranges to 5 percent where wind action has hummocked the surface. The soils formed in sandy alluvial sediments. The climate is semiarid continental. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 60 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches, of which more than 1/2 occurs in the summer months as heavy thunderstorms. The frost-free period ranges from\n180 to 200 days and elevation ranges from 4,200 to 5,300 feet."

Ima and La Lande soils have control section texture finer than loamy fine sand and have regular distribution of organic matter.  Montoya soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section and have cracks 1 cm. or more wide when dry. San Jon soils have texture in the control section finer than loamy very fine sand."
