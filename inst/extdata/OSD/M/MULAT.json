Reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid in all horizons except the surface where limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or value of 4, and chroma 1.  The Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or value of 4, and chroma of 2, with or without mottles in shades of yellow and brown.  Combined thickness of the A and Eg horizons ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.  Mottles are in various shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray, and are fine to medium in size.  Weighted average clay content ranges from 14 to 22 percent in the Btg horizon.  Silt content is less than 20 percent.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Some pedons have a BE horizon of loamy sand.  It has the same color range as the Btg horizon and ranges up to 6 inches thick.  Some pedons have a BCg horizon of dominantly loamy sand or loamy fine sand but includes sandy loam.  Colors are similar to the Btg horizon and thickness ranges up to 12 inches.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 6, and chroma of 2; or it is neutral (N) with value of 5 or 6.

The water table is within a depth of 12 inches for 2 to 8 months of the year under natural conditions and varies between depths of 12 to 30 inches during droughty periods. Areas with poor outlets are ponded or have water above the soil surface for a period of less than 1 month during the wettest season."

Some of the wetter areas contain baldcypress and pitcher plants."
