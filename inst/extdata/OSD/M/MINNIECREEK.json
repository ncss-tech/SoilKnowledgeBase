  "OVERVIEW": "The Minniecreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metavolcanic rocks, mainly greenschist.  Minniecreek soils are on metamorphic Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 2 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches, (1219 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, (14 degrees C).",
