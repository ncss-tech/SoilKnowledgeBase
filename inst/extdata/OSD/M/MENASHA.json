  "OVERVIEW": "The Menasha series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey lacustrine deposits on glacial lake basins and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",

In certain settings, Menasha soils are subject to common flooding for long periods.  Otherwise flooding is rare or there is none. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low to moderately high (0.01 to 1.41 micrometers per second). Permeability is slow or very slow.
