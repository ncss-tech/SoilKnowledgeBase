Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 737 mm (25 to 29 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 8.9 degrees C (45 to 48 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Neenah and the moderately well drained and well drained Winneconne soils form a drainage sequence with the Menasha soils. The Neenah and Winneconne soils occupy slightly higher areas than the Menasha. Nearby where the clayey lacustrine deposits are underlain by sand at depths of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) are the poorly drained Poy soils."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to high. In certain settings, Menasha soils are subject to common flooding for long periods.  Otherwise flooding is rare or there is none. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low to moderately high (0.01 to 1.41 micrometers per second). Permeability is slow or very slow. These soil have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 0 to 31 cm (0 to 1 foot) for long periods in most years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Drained areas are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, oats, and hay. Undrained areas are used for pastureland or woodland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous swamp forest of white ash, green ash American elm, red maple, silver maple, and swamp white oak, with a ground cover of marsh grasses."
