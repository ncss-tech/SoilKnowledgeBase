  "OVERVIEW": "The Magdalena series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic rocks and sediments.  Magdalena soils are on bajadas.  Slopes range from 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
