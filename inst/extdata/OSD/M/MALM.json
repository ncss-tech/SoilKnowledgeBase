All of these soils except Lariat and Nargon are deep or very deep to bedrock.  Lariat soils do not have a calcic horizon immediately above the bedrock.  Nargon soils are loam or silt loam in the particle-size control section with 12 to 27 percent total clay and have a weighted average over 18 percent clay and have 10 to 18 percent carbonate clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed dominantly in moderately coarse textured eolian deposits, but the parent material includes alluvium and residuum weathered from the underlying basalt.  The parent material is dominantly from basaltic, quartzitic and sedimentary rock sources.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches including 1.5 to 3 feet of snow.  Average frost-free period is 70 to 125 days.  Average annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F."
