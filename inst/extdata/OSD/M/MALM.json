  "OVERVIEW": "The Malm series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed mainly in eolian deposits.  Malm soils are on lava plains and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  Permeability  is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The soils formed dominantly in moderately coarse textured eolian deposits, but the parent material includes alluvium and residuum weathered from the underlying basalt.  The parent material is dominantly from basaltic, quartzitic and sedimentary rock sources.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches including 1.5 to 3 feet of snow.  Average frost-free period is 70 to 125 days.  Average annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F."
