  "OVERVIEW": "The Mulford series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Mulford soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches (229 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. (11.1 degrees C)",

Breadsprings and Docpar soils have secondary carbonate accumulations, hues yellower than 5YR and are cooler and more moist. Hickerson soils have hues yellower than 5YR and. Patterfield soils have hues yellower than 5YR and salt and gypsum accumulations in the substratum and Cr horizons. Hickerson and Patterfield soils reflect the soil forming factors of northeastern Utah having a more even ditstribution of moisture throughout the year."
