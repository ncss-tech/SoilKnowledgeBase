    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Breadsprings (NM), Docpar (WY), Hickerson(UT), and Patterfield(UT) series. Breadsprings and Docpar soils have secondary carbonate accumulations, hues yellower than 5YR and are cooler and more moist. Hickerson soils have hues yellower than 5YR and. Patterfield soils have hues yellower than 5YR and salt and gypsum accumulations in the substratum and Cr horizons. Hickerson and Patterfield soils reflect the soil forming factors of northeastern Utah having a more even ditstribution of moisture throughout the year."

Mulford soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 13 inches (229 to 330 mm) which occurs as summer thunderstorms and light winter rain and snow. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."
