  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mulligan series consists of shallow and very shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium weathered from calcareous sandstone.  Mulligan soils are on structural benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.",
