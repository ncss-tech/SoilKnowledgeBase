They make up 35 to 60 percent by volume of the 10- to 40-inch control section.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 63 degrees F.  The soil is continuously dry from late April or May until November; it is moist in some parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches all the rest of the year.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown or brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly very fine sandy loam, or gravelly fine sandy loam and has granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is slightly acid to medium acid.  It has less than 1 percent organic matter.\nThe B horizon is reddish brown or brown in 7.5YR or 5YR hue.  It is very gravelly to very cobbly loam and has 2 to 3 percent more clay than the A horizon.  This horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly or medium acid."

They formed in mixed gravelly and cobbly sandy alluvium high in metabasic, metasedimentary, and granitic rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid, mesothermal with cool moist winters and somewhat foggy dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  Average January temperature is about 52 degrees F., average July temperature is about 71 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 280 to 330 days."
