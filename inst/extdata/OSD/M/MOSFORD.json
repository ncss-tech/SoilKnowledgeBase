  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 45 to 80 inches or more.  The coarse-loamy mantle contains up to 10 percent rock fragments by volume and ranges from 10 to 22 inches thick. Typically, the underlying sediments contain less than 10 percent gravel by volume, but some pedons contain as much as 25 percent. Gravel size is dominantly 2 mm to less than 10 mm.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick. When it is 16 or more inches thick, it has a sandy particle size class in the major part, or a sandy contrasting layer between depths of 16 and 20 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bw or 2BC horizon when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand, coarse sand, or sand. It is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues. It is strongly acid to slightly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Allivar(T), Arvilla, Binford, and Sverdrup series. The Allivar soils have soil saturation in the lower one third of the series control section. Arvilla soils have free carbonates at depths of 13 to 25 inches. Binford soils have more than 20 percent shale fragments in the .1 to 76 mm fraction in the lower one-third of the series control section. Sverdrup soils contain free carbonates at depths of 15 to 44 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mosford soils are level to gently sloping and are on slightly convex, plane, or concave position on outwash plains, stream terraces or flood plains.  Slope gradient commonly range from 0 to 3 percent, but the complete range is 0 to 6 percent.  These soils formed in a thin loamy mantle and the underlying sandy glacial outwash.  These sediments are of Late Wisconsin Age.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 33.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation ranges from 675 to 1400 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Duelm, Hubbard, Isan, and Sandberg soils.  Duelm soils are moderately well drained and formed mostly in coarse sand.  The Hubbard soils typically are on more convex areas and have sandy soil textures throughout the profile.  Isan soils are very poorly and poorly drained, typically in lower concave position. Sandberg soils are typically on more convex or more sloping areas."
