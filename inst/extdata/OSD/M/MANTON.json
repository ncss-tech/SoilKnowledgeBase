  "OVERVIEW": "The Manton series consists of well drained (minimal) yellowish brown lateritic soils (see remarks) developed from semiconsolidated coarse textured andesitic tuff.  They occur on rounded hilly to steep topography under mixed conifers.  Characteristically the Manton soils have brown, sandy loam A horizons and strong brown loam B2 horizons.  They are deep or very deep and medium acid.  Manton soils occur in the same general area as Cohasset, Forward, and Jiggs soils.  They resemble Cohasset, Forward, Jiggs, and Lyonsville soils.  Cohasset soils developed from weathered andesite or breccia of volcanic origin, are usually redder (by at least 1/4 letter interval in hue) than the Manton and have clay loam textured B2 horizons.  Forward soils lack B horizons, are moderately deep, and have light brownish gray A horizons.  Jiggs soils lack B horizons, are moderately deep, and developed from weathered hard rhyolitic flow rock.  Lyonsville soils are gravelly throughout, have sandy clay loam or sandy clay B2 horizons, and developed from harder rocks.  Manton soils occur at elevations of 2,000 to 4,500 feet in a subhumid microthermal climate having a mean annual precipitation of 30 to 45 inches, part of which falls as snow between November and March; with warm dry summers and cold, wet winters; an average January temperature of about 34 degrees F., an average July temperature of about 67 degrees F., and a mean annual temperature of about 49 degrees F.  The average frost free season is about 120 days.  The Manton series is mapped in the southern Cascade Mountains in California and is important for timber production.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The A horizon ranges in color from brown to grayish brown (10YR or 7.5YR hues), rarely pale brown or light brown; in texture from sandy loam to nearly loam; and in reaction from medium to slightly acid.  The upper 1 to 3 inches is usually darker than the lower A horizon.  The B horizon ranges in color from strong brown to reddish brown, yellowish red, or reddish brown; in texture from loam to light sandy clay loam, and in reaction from medium to strongly acid.  Depth to weakly consolidated tuff is 4 to 6 feet.  The parent material is gravelly in places and may be rhyolitic cinders."
