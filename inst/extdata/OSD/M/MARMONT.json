These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper 12 inches of the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples and 35 to 50 percent pumice fragments 2.0 to 5.0 mm in diameter and 0 to 5 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has chroma of 1 to 3 dry or moist.  It is very paragravelly ashy fine sandy loam or very paragravelly ashy sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has 50 to 70 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  It is extremely gravelly sand or extremely gravelly coarse sand."

Elevations range from 1,100 to 1,600 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winter.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the average July temperature is about 70 degrees F, and the average annual temperature is about 47 to 49 degrees F.
