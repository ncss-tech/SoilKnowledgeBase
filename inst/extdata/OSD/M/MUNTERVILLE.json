  "OVERVIEW": "The Munterville series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in 5 to 50 centimeters of silty or loamy materials and in the underlying residuum from brown and gray acid Pennsylvanian shale. These soils are on convex side slopes and escarpment-like areas that parallel major streams. Slope ranges from 5 to 40 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 965 millimeters.",

It may be silty materials such as loess, or loamy sediments derived from till, and the underlying residuum from interbedded shale, limestone, lignite, or sandstone.\nDrainage class is difficult to assess because of the color inherited from the shale.\nThe gray colors in the lower half of the series control section are inherited from the shale and were not considered in classification of the series.  The extreme variation in the shale parent material raises the question as to family placement.  However, available data indicate that the clay mineralogy typically is mixed and the particle-size class is fine family.\nThe platy structure in the 2C horizon is inherited from the shale parent material and is not a result of pedogenic processes.\nCation-exchange activity class supported by lab data, ISU, Ames, Iowa.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa-various pedons\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
