    "content": "REMARKS:\nParticle-size control section--the zone from a depth of 20 to 70 centimeters;\nseries control section--the zone from the surface to a depth of 150 centimeters.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon include:\nochric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 20 centimeters (A and E horizons);\nalbic horizon--the zone from a depth of 10 to 20 centimeters (E horizon);\nargillic horizon--the zone from a depth of 20 to 86 centimeters (Bt1, 2Bt2, and 2Bt3 horizons);\nparalithic contact--the contact with clayey shale at a depth of 191 centimeters (2Cr horizon);\nudic moisture regime.\nThe geological origin of the mantle is variable. It may be silty materials such as loess, or loamy sediments derived from till, and the underlying residuum from interbedded shale, limestone, lignite, or sandstone.\nDrainage class is difficult to assess because of the color inherited from the shale.\nThe gray colors in the lower half of the series control section are inherited from the shale and were not considered in classification of the series.  The extreme variation in the shale parent material raises the question as to family placement.  However, available data indicate that the clay mineralogy typically is mixed and the particle-size class is fine family.\nThe platy structure in the 2C horizon is inherited from the shale parent material and is not a result of pedogenic processes.\nCation-exchange activity class supported by lab data, ISU, Ames, Iowa.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa-various pedons\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
