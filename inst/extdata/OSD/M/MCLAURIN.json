  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 inches to more than 80 inches. In some pedons a few ironstone fragments or chert gravel, or both make up less than 10 percent of the volume are present in some pedons.  The Bt/E and the B't horizons are definitive for the series. The particle size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay and 20 to 50 percent silt. Reaction is strongly acid to very strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4, and chroma of 3 to 6. A value of 3 with chroma of 2 or less is limited to horizons with a thickness of less than 6 inches.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe EB or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has the same range in color as the Bt horizon. Texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  The E part of the material is almost stripped of clay. It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8, and makes up about 10 to 25 percent of the volume in a discontinuous pattern. Texture is sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand. Some pedons have an E/B horizon.\nThe B't horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loam or sandy clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Heidel series is the only known soil in the same family. The Benndale, Butters and Niwana series are in a closely related family. Heidel soils are on similar positions but do not have a bisequum. Benndale, Butters and Niwana soils are semiactive. In addition, Benndale and Niwana have yellower subsoils and Butters soils have less than 20 percent silt in the control section. Niwana soils are in the Western Coastal Plain MLRA (133B)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McLaurin soils are on broad ridge tops and upper hillsides of ridges dividing major streams in the Southern Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. They formed in loamy marine or stream deposits. The climate is humid subtropical. The mean annual temperature is 64 degrees Fahrenheit and the mean annual precipitation is 61 inches near the type location."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Benndale and Heidel series and the Eustis, Lucedale, Lucy, Malbis, Ora, Poarch, Ruston, Smithdale, Sweatman, Troup and Wadley series. The excessively drained Eustis soils are on similar to higher positions and have a sandy control section. Lucedale and Ruston soils are on similar positions but have a fine-loamy control section. In addition, Lucedale soils are rhodic. Lucy, Troup and Wadley soils are on similar to higher positions in more dissected parts of the landscape. In addition, Lucy soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick while the excessively drained Troup and the well to somewhat excessively drained Wadley soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick. The moderately well and well drained Malbis and Poarch soils are on similar to slightly higher positions, have yellower subsoils and are plinthic. In addition, Malbis soils have fine-loamy subsoils. The moderately well drained Ora soils are on slightly higher ridge tops and have a fragipan. Smithdale soils mainly are on adjacent hill sides and have fine-loamy control sections. Sweatman soils are on lower adjacent hill side positions and have clayey control sections."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of McLaurin soils have been cleared and are used for crops such as cotton, corn, soybeans and small grains. Many areas are used for pasture and woodland. The principal vegetation of wooded areas is longleaf pine, slash pine, loblolly pine and shortleaf pines. Some areas are composed of mixed hardwoods and pines with an understory of shrubs and grasses."
