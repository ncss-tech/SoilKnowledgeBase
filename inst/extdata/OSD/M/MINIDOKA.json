  "OVERVIEW": "The Minidoka series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loess and alluvium from mixed sources.  They are on basalt plains and terraces, with slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
