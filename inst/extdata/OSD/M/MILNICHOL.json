  "OVERVIEW": "The Milnichol series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake plains and outwash plains. These soils formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine sediments overlying loamy lacustrine deposits. Slope range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C. (48 degrees F).",
