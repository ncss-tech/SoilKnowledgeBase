  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact with weathered bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to lithic contact with hard bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in all horizons except where the surface has been limed.  Rock fragment content is 15 to 60 percent by volume in the A, AB, BA, and E horizons, 5 to 35 percent in the Bt horizon, and 15 to 60 percent in the BC and C horizons. Fragments are dominantly channers, with a few flagstones in the A horizon of some pedons.  Some areas have stones or boulders scattered about on the surface and are mapped as stony or bouldery phases.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 8.  In uneroded or slightly eroded pedons, it is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  In eroded pedons, the Ap horizon may be silty clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The AB or BA horizon is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction and has more than 30 percent silt.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, or is mottled with these colors.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8, is mottled in these colors, or is multicolored.   It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is commonly multicolored weathered sericite schist, phyllite, or other fine-grained metamorphic rock.  It can be dug with difficulty with a spade.\nTypically, the R horizon is hard unweathered sericite schist, phyllite, or other fine-grained high-grade metamorphic rock."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cheaha, Fruithurst, Rion, Rome, Sherless, Sherwood, State, Sugargrove, Tidings, and Wickham series.  Cheaha and Sherless soils are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock and contain sandstone fragments, and Cheaha has hard bedrock within 20 to 40 inches.  Fruithurst soils have slate bedrock, contain slate fragments, and hard bedrock is below 60 inches.  Rion, Rome, Sherwood, State, and Wickham soils are very deep and have thicker sola.  Sugargrove soils have hard limestone bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Tidings soils have weathered sandstone bedrock at 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Montonia soils are gently sloping to steep and are on ridges and side slopes in the Southern Piedmont.  Slopes are commonly 15 to 45 percent, but range from 2 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from fine grained metamorphic rock such as sericite schist and phyllite.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 47 to 49 inches and mean annual air temperature ranges from 59 to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 180 to 210 days."

Badin, Georgeville, Lignum, Nanford, Tarrus, and Uwharrie soils are fine.  Badin, Georgeville, Goldston, Nanford, Tarrus, and Uwharrie soils occur in the same landscape positions as Montonia soils.  Goldston soils are shallow and lack a Bt horizon.  Lignum soils are moderately well drained and somewhat poorly drained and are on toe slopes and around heads of drains."
