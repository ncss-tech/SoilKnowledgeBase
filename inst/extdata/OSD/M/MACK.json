  "OVERVIEW": "The Mack series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Mack soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, stream terraces and mesas. Slopes are 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 203 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
