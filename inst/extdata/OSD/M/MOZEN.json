  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness if the mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches and includes part of the argillic horizon.  The upper 12 to 18 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half acid oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15 bar retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dry samples.  The particle-size control section averages 27 to 33 percent clay in the fine earth fraction, more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and 0 to 15 percent coarse fragments.  Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 3 percent in the A1 horizon or Ap horizon if present.  Solum thickness and depth to lihtic contact with basalt is 25 to 40 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 23 to 35 inches.\nThe A horizon is silt loam or loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It is silt loam or loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Btkb, 2Btb and 2Bwb horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  They are loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  The 2Btb and 2Bwb horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and they are absent in some pedons."

These soils formed in loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface, slope alluvium and some residuum from basalt.  Elevations are 2,400 to 2,800 feet.  These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and average July temperature is about 69 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
