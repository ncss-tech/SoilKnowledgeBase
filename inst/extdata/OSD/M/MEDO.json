  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the organic material ranges from 16 to 51 inches.  It is derived primarily from herbaceous plants.  The organic matter content ranges from 20 to 50 percent in the organic surface and 5 to 20 percent in the 2A horizon.  There is less than 10 percent clay in the lower third of the series control section.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR, 5YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 1.  It is dominantly sapric material, however some pedons have thin layers of hemic material less than 10 inches thick.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some subhorizons may contain free carbonates.\nThe 2A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 1.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or mucky modifiers of these textures.  Rock fragment make up 0 to 15 percent by volume, mostly gravel in size.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons contain thin layers of coprogenous earth.\nThe 2Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 0 through 3.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, or clay loam. Rock fragment make up 0 to 15 percent by volume, mostly gravel in size. The reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, or is neutral, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is loamy fine sand, sand, loamy sand, fine sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand or their gravelly analogues.  Rock fragments make up 2 to 25 percent by volume, mostly gravel in size.   It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons contain thin strata of loam or silt loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Medo soils are in basins that typically were formerly lakes or ponds on outwash plains and moraines.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 32 inches.  Frost free days range from 125 to 165.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1600 feet above sea level."

Canisteo and Fieldon soils are on the rims of depressions and are poorly drained.   Houghton, Klossner and Muskego soils are in larger depressions. Biscay and Mayer soils are in drainageways and nearly level areas outside the depressions and are poorly drained.  Linder soils are on higher slopes and are somewhat poorly drained."

Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic layers and rapid in the underlying material.  The apparent seasonal high water table is at 1.0 foot above to 0.5 foot below the soil surface at some time during November to May in most years."
