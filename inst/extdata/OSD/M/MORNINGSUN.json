Birkbeck, Cadiz, Iona, Redbud, and Winfield soils average less than 40 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Campton and Somonauk soils formed in loess and loamy stratified outwash and are in MLRAs 95B and 108A. Elco, Homen, Libre, and Minnith soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Eleroy and Rocheport soils have a paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Inton soils have a matrix color with hue yellower than 10YR and chroma of less than 3 within 76 cm (30 inches) of the surface. Mayville and Zurich soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Rockfield soils have a densic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches).

Mean annual air temperature ranges from 11 to 13 degrees C (51 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 160 days. Elevation is 317 to 349 meters (1,040 feet to 1,145) feet above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Fincastle and Sugarvalley soils are in lower landform positions. Xenia soils are on slightly higher landform positions and have redoximorphic features in the upper part of the subsoil."

Field investigations indicate that these soils in the Boston Plains area formed in loess and the underlying water modified till that is dense but not restricting to root and water penetration.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of about 25 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from 25 to 107 cm (Bt, 2Bt horizons).\nAquic conditions: iron depletions present between 84 and 129 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for PB-80, the typical pedon, and PB-72 from the Soil Characterization Laboratory at The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
