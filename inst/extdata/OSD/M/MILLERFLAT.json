    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  Depth to stratified gravelly and sandy alluvium is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section has 45 to 80 percent rock fragments and 25 to 35 percent field estimated clay.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  Depth to mottles with chroma of 2 (redox depletions) is 20 to 30 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 30 to 40 inches. Base saturation is assumed to be 50 to 70 percent within some part of the upper 30 inches of the solum.  The upper part of the solum is estimated to have a phosphate-retention of 25 to 35 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate of 5 to 20 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or silt loam with 15 to 20 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 45 to 80 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles."

The soil formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources with an influence of volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by cold and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

Mackatie soils are ashy over loamy, well drained, and are deep to bedrock at higher elevations.  Pipp soils are ashy-skeletal, somewhat excessively drained, deep to bedrock, and are on south-facing slopes."
