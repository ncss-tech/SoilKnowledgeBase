  "OVERVIEW": "The McCarty series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in pedisediments and/or slope alluvium over residuum derived from gypsiferous sandstone and shale.  McCarty soils are on pediments and small alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
