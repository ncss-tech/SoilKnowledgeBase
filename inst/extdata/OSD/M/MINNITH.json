  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Minnith series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in loess and loamy residuum from sandstone.  These soils are on upland ridgetops and side slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sandstone is below a depth of 60 inches. Depth to the 2Bt horizon ranges from 24 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2B horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and rarely 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 8 and often mottled with chroma of 2 or less.  It is clay loam, loam, silt loam, silty clay loam and rarely sandy clay loam. Sand content increases with depth.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam.  It commonly has mottles with values of 5 to 7 and chroma of 3 or less. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent."

Birkbeck, Homen, Inton, Iona, and Winfield soils do not have a 2B horizon within 40 inches of the surface. Downsouth, Grays, Hedrick, and Kaneville soils have a surface layer that meets the requirements for mollic except for thickness. Elco soils formed partly in glacial till and have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 55 degrees F. Libre soils have a dense layer in the Bt horizon and have a base saturation of less than 60 percent at the critical depth. Mayville and Zurich soils have carbonates starting at 20 to 40 inches. Redbud soils have more than 35 percent clay in some part of the series control section and formed partly in lacustrine sediments. Rocheport soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Rockfield soils have carbonates within 60 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Minnith soils are associated with the underlying sandstone formation in rather narrow bands, in some places displaced by faulting, and on side slope and ridgetop positions. Slope gradient ranges from 2 to 14 percent. The soils formed in 24 to 40 inches of loess and the underlying loamy residuum weathered from sandstone. The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Menfro soils occupy ridgetops or foot slopes where the loess is thicker.  Weingarten soils are on similar positions.  Gasconade, Lily, and Ramsey soils have bedrock at depths less than 40 inches and are on lower side slopes.  Goss soils have cherty clayey subsoils and are on lower side slopes.  Holstein soils are fine-loamy and are on lower side slopes."
