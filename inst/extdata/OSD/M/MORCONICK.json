  "OVERVIEW": "The Morconick series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 20 to 40 centimeters of loamy alluvium and the underlying sandy alluvium. These soils are on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.",
