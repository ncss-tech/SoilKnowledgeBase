  "OVERVIEW": "The Macreeing series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in loess and volcanic ash mixed with colluvium. Macreeing soils are on mountain side slopes usually with a south aspect. Elevation is 2,500 to 3,800 feet. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The upper 7 to 23 inches of the soil has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.50 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. Coarse fragments in the control section range from 35 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. Texture is ashy sandy loam, ashy coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam and is very cobbly or very gravelly.
