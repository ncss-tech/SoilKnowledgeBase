These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice. The upper 7 to 23 inches of the soil has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.20 to 1.50 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. Coarse fragments in the control section range from 35 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. Texture is ashy sandy loam, ashy coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam and is very cobbly or very gravelly. Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. Texture is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam and is very gravelly, extremely gravelly, or very cobbly. Soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Macreeing soils are on mountain side slopes that usually have a south aspect. Slope is 30 to 90 percent. They formed in loess and volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from rhyolite or granodiorite. Elevations are 2,500 to 3,800 feet. They are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F. The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F and the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 140 to 180 days."
