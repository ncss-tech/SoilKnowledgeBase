  "OVERVIEW": "The McElmo series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable, sodic soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from bentonitic shale and sandstone on dipslopes of cuestas.  Slopes are 5 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
