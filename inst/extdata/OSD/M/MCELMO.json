Slopes range from 5 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,300 to 6,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The series type location was moved to the Shiprock Soil Survey Area in Western San Juan County, New Mexico in 1988; this area better represents the taxonomic classification.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 1 inch.  (A horizon)\nNatric horizon - The zone from 1 to about 14 inches.  (2Btn/E and 2Btkn horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 14 to about 30 inches.\n(3Bky1 horizon)\nGypsic horizon - The zone from 30 to about 54 inches.\n(3Bky2 and 3CY horizons)\nParalithic contact - The presence of soft shale bedrock\nat about 54 inches.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy - Soils classified according to the Eighth Edition, 1998.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Percent gypsum and SAR values are estimated.  Salinity values were determined on three pedons with an Instant EC salinity kit.  Calcium carbonate equivalence was determined with a field volume calcimeter.\n-Annual Pattern of Soil-Water States- -----------------------------------------------------------\nDepth   Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec\n(in)\n0-1      f   f   d   d   d   d   d   m   d   d   m   f\n1-4      f   w   m   m   d   d   d   m   m   m   m   m\n4-14     f   m   m   m   d   d   d   d   m   m   m   m\n14-30    d   d   m   d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d\n30-41    d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d\n41-54    d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d   d ------------------------------------------------------------\nf: frozen more than half of the month\nw: wet more than half of the month\nm: moist more than half of the month\nd: dry more than half of the month\nInformation gathered from: Estimates and field notes\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
