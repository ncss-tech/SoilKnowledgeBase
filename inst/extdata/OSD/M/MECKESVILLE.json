  "OVERVIEW": "The Meckesville series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in colluvium, glacial till, or congeliturbate from red acid sandstone, siltstone and shale. They are on the concave sideslopes of upland ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Permeability is moderately slow. Mean annual precipitation is 41 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
