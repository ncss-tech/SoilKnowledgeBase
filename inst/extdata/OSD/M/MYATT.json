(4 to 9 inches thick)\nEg--5 to 10 inches; light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) loam, weak fine granular and weak fine subangular blocky structure; friable; many fine roots; few fine distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and brownish yellow (10YR 6/6) masses of iron accumulation; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (0 to 8 inches thick)\nBtg--10 to 32 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) sandy clay loam, weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few fine roots; common distinct clay films on faces of peds and in pores; many coarse distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) masses of iron accumulation; very strongly acid; gradual wavy boundary.  (16 to 50 inches thick)\nBCg--32 to 50 inches; gray (10YR 6/1) loam; weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; common faint clay films along vertical cracks and on some faces of peds; many prominent strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) masses of iron accumulations; extremely acid; clear wavy boundary.  (0 to 20 inches thick)\n2Cg--50 to 72 inches; 35 percent gray (10YR 6/1), 30 percent yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) and 30 percent strong brown (7.5YR 5/6) gravelly fine sandy loam; massive; very friable; the areas of gray are iron depletions and the areas of yellowish brown and strong brown are iron accumulations; extremely acid."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from extremely acid to strongly acid in the lower part of the solum and the underlying material.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 3 percent, by volume, in the solum and from 5 to 25 percent in the underlying material. The control section has 18 to 35 percent clay and 20 to 45 percent silt.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow and gray range from none to common. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe ABg, BAg, Eg or BEg horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations in shades of brown and yellow range from few to many. Texture has the same range as the A or Ap horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 3 to 7.  Iron accumulations are in shades of brown, red or yellow range from few to many.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Some pedons have a subhorizon within the Btg horizon of sandy clay with strata of sandier material.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has the same range in hue, value,\nand chroma as the Btg horizon.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam or loam.  Some pedons are stratified with sandy and clayey material.\nThe CBg, Cg or 2Cg horizon, where present, has the same range in hue, value and chroma as the Bg horizon; or there is no dominant color and is variegated in shades of yellow, brown, red and gray. Some pedons have gleyed horizons.  Texture is dominantly sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or their gravelly analogues; but some pedons are stratified with sandy and clayey material."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no known series in the same family. The Ogeechee series is in a closely related family. Other series in similar families include the Amy, Lumbee, Rains, Tomotley and Weston series.  All of these series are on similar positions as Myatt soils. Ogeechee and Rains soils have a solum thickness of more than 60 inches.  In addition, Ogeechee soils are subactive. Amy soils have fine-silty control sections.  Lumbee soils have a solum thickness of less than 40 inches.  Tomotley soils have mixed mineralogy.  Weston soils have coarse-loamy control sections."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Myatt soils are on level or nearly level broad stream terraces that and upland flats in the Southern Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in medium to moderately fine-textured marine or fluvatile sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 56 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Rains and Weston soils on similar landforms, these include the Bibb, Leaf, Mantachie, Pheba, Prentiss, Savannah and Stough soils. Bibb and the somewhat poorly drained Mantachie soils are on lower adjacent flood plains and do not have an argillic horizon.  In addition, Bibb soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  Leaf soils are on similar landforms but have clayey control sections.  Pheba, Prentiss, Savannah, and Stough soils are on adjacent positions. All of these series have fragipans except Stough which has fragic qualities. In addition, the somewhat poorly drained Pheba soils have coarse-silty control sections, the moderately well drained Prentiss soils have coarse-loamy control sections, Savannah soils are moderately well drained and the somewhat poorly drained Stough soils have coarse-loamy control sections."
