  "OVERVIEW": "The Marpol series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum from quartz-diorite.. Marpol soils are on side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains. The mean annual precipitation is about 355 millimeters (14 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 21 degrees C (69 degrees F). Slopes range from 25 to 70 percent",
