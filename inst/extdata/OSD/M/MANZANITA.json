    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to unconsolidated sediments is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 7 and 20 inches is dry in all parts from June 1 to October 15 and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 15.  Base saturation (sum of cations) is 50 to 75 percent throughout.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral throughout.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 30 percent pebbles.  Clay mineralogy is mixed, but contains a high percentage of kaolinite.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 10YR 3/3, or 4/3.  Moist value and chroma of 3.5 or less occur only in the upper 6 inches or less.  It is loam, gravelly loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 5 to 30 percent black shot and pebbles.  Some pedons lack an AB horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8; 5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 7/6, 7/8; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 6/8, 7/6 or 7/8.  Moist color is 2.5YR 3/6, 4/6; 5YR 3/6, 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, or 7.5YR 5/6.  Colors are usually variegated.  It is clay loam, clay, gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay with 5 to 35 percent pebbles.  The lower part of the argillic horizon, below the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay.  Some pedons lack a BAt or BCt horizon."
