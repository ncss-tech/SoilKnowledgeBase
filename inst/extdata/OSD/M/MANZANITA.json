The soil between the depths of 7 and 20 inches is dry in all parts from June 1 to October 15 and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 15.  Base saturation (sum of cations) is 50 to 75 percent throughout.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral throughout.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 5 to 30 percent pebbles.  Clay mineralogy is mixed, but contains a high percentage of kaolinite.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 10YR 3/3, or 4/3.  Moist value and chroma of 3.5 or less occur only in the upper 6 inches or less.  It is loam, gravelly loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 5 to 30 percent black shot and pebbles.  Some pedons lack an AB horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5YR 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, 5/8; 5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 7/6, 7/8; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8, 6/6, 6/8, 7/6 or 7/8.  Moist color is 2.5YR 3/6, 4/6; 5YR 3/6, 4/6, 4/8, 5/6, or 7.5YR 5/6.  Colors are usually variegated.  It is clay loam, clay, gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly clay with 5 to 35 percent pebbles.  The lower part of the argillic horizon, below the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent clay.  Some pedons lack a BAt or BCt horizon."
