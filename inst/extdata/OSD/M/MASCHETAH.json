  "OVERVIEW": "The Maschetah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous silty eolian or alluvial deposits.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills. Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
