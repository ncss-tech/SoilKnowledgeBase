  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Manistee soils are on large lake plains and smaller lake plains within outwash plains, till plains, and ground moraines. Slope gradients are commonly 2 to 12 percent but range from 0 to about 50 percent. They formed in sandy lacustrine deposits and outwash and the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranging from 686 to 864 mm (27 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 8.3 degrees C (41 to 47 degrees F)."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Allendale, Au Gres, Croswell, Fibre, Kalkaska, Kellogg, Melita, Ontonagon, Rubicon, Superior, and Wakeley soils. The moderately well drained Kellogg soil, the somewhat poorly drained Allendale, and the poorly drained Fibre and Wakeley soils form a drainage sequence with Manistee. The Kellogg and the Allendale soils are in slightly lower landscape positions and the Fibre and Wakeley soils are in depressions. The Kalkaska, Rubicon, and Melita soils are somewhat excessively drained or excessively drained, sandy associates and the Ontonagon and Superior soils are well drained or moderately well drained clayey associates on similar landscape positions. The moderately well drained Croswell and somewhat poorly drained Au Gres soils are in slightly lower landscape positions and are common sandy associates of the Manistee soils."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy part and moderately low or low in the underlying clayey part. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy part and slow or very slow in the underlying clayey part."
