  "REVDATE": "06/2003",
  "STATES": "IA,MO,NE,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Modale series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in 18 to 30 inches of silty alluvium and the underlying clayey alluvium. Permeability is moderate in the silty alluvium and slow or very slow in the underlying clayey alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",
