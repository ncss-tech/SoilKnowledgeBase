  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the soft shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to hard bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid in the A horizon and from medium acid to very strongly acid in the B horizon.  In most pedons, at least some part of the B horizon is strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Mottles and colors with chroma of 2 or less are in the lower part of the B horizon in some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, or their channery analogues.  The content of sand, coarser than very fine, averages less than 10 percent.  Volume of shale fragments, which are less than 3 inches in diameter, ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  The combined fine sand or coarser sand and the shale fragments are 15 percent or more by weight in the control section.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, soft, acid, micaceous shale.  In some pedons the upper part is loam or silt loam with rock-like structure and shale fragments.  In some pedons there are thin strata of limestone."

The Belmont, Kanawha, Martinsville, Miami, Nodine, Relay, Sisson, and Strawn soils do not have coarse fragments of micaceous shales and do not have a paralithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.

Hollinger soils contain fragments of schist and flakes of mica in the control section.  Military and Whalan soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface. Westville soils have at least one subhorizon of the Bt horizon that has 5YR hue."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on rounded ridgetops and convex side slopes.  Slope gradients typically range from 5 to 10 percent and the extreme range is from 2 to about 30 percent. The soils formed in residuum weathered from acid, micaceous shales.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 40 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this series are:  Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches (A, E and BE horizons).  Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 11 inches to 35 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).  Paralithic contact - 35 inches.  The type location is moved from Henry County to Howard County.  Henry County is transitional between the mesic and thermic temperature regimes. Howard County is considered as being only in the mesic temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
