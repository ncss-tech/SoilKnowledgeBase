  "OVERVIEW": "The Mandeville series consists of well and moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils moderately deep to shale. They formed in residuum weathered from acid micaceous shales. These soils are on convex ridgetops and side slopes.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 36 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the soft shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to hard bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid in the A horizon and from medium acid to very strongly acid in the B horizon.  In most pedons, at least some part of the B horizon is strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Mottles and colors with chroma of 2 or less are in the lower part of the B horizon in some pedons. Texture is silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, or their channery analogues.  The content of sand, coarser than very fine, averages less than 10 percent.  Volume of shale fragments, which are less than 3 inches in diameter, ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  The combined fine sand or coarser sand and the shale fragments are 15 percent or more by weight in the control section.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered, soft, acid, micaceous shale.  In some pedons the upper part is loam or silt loam with rock-like structure and shale fragments.  In some pedons there are thin strata of limestone."

Argillic horizon - the zone from approximately 11 inches to 35 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and Bt3 horizons).  Paralithic contact - 35 inches.  The type location is moved from Henry County to Howard County.  Henry County is transitional between the mesic and thermic temperature regimes. Howard County is considered as being only in the mesic temperature regime."
