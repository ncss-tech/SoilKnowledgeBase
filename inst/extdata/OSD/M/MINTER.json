  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the upper part and ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower subsoil.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redox features in shades of brown or gray are in most pedons.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a thin BA horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 1 or less, or value of 6 and chroma of 2 or less. Most pedons have few to common redox features in shades of yellow and brown. Pedons without higher chroma redox features have chroma of 1 or less.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or less, or value of 6 or 7 and chroma of 2 or less with few to many redox features in shades of yellow, red, or brown.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The control section averages from 35 to 50 percent clay and more than 30 percent silt.  A few fine flakes of mica are present in the lower part of the solum.\nThe C horizon, where present, is stratified alluvium, variable in color and texture and often contains few to common quartz pebbles."

Argent soils have less than 30 percent silt in the control section and range from medium acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  Cherokee and Meggett soils have abrupt texture change between the ochric epipedon and the argillic horizon.  Gaylesville and Okeetee soils have a horizon in the upper Bt dominated by chromas of more than 2.  Lightning soils are dry in some parts of the moisture control section for longer periods of time during the growing season."

Near the type location the average annual rainfall is 52.5 inches and the average annual temperature is 66.2 degrees F."

The Canton Bend, Congaree, McQueen, and Wickham soils are on slightly higher, more convex, positions than the Minter soils and are better drained.  In addition, Congaree and Wickham soils are fine-loamy.  The Leeper and Una soils are on floodplains and do not have an argillic horizon."
