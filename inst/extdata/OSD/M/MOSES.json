    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 39 to 43 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle ranges from 7 to 14 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.75 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 12 to 15 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Some pedons lack the thin A horizon (Mt.  St. Helens 'T'ash) just below the organic layer.\nThe A horizon hs value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles, 0 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 25 percent stones or boulders. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam with a 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly coarse sandy loam or very gravelly coarse sandy loam with 25 to 55 percent pebbles, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 5 to 15 percent stones.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons do not have a 2Bw horizon and have a 2BC or 2CB horizon with texture similar to the 2Bw horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam and is very gravelly, very cobbly, or very stony. It has 25 to 50 percent pebbles, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.   Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 3,500 to 6,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches. The mean January temperature is about 20 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
