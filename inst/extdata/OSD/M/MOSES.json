  "OVERVIEW": "The Moses series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rocks with a mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on toeslopes, footslopes, backslopes, and broad ridges of mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 39 to 43 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle ranges from 7 to 14 inches and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.75 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of more than 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 12 to 15 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Some pedons lack the thin A horizon (Mt.  St. Helens 'T'ash) just below the organic layer.\nThe A horizon hs value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles, 0 to 25 percent cobbles and 0 to 25 percent stones or boulders. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam with a 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is gravelly coarse sandy loam or very gravelly coarse sandy loam with 25 to 55 percent pebbles, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 5 to 15 percent stones.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral. Some pedons do not have a 2Bw horizon and have a 2BC or 2CB horizon with texture similar to the 2Bw horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam and is very gravelly, very cobbly, or very stony. It has 25 to 50 percent pebbles, 5 to 30 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.   Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral."

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
