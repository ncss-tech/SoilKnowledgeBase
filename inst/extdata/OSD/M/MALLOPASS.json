    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 50 inches.  The epipedon ranges from 0.6 to 4 percent organic carbon, decreasing regularly with increasing depth.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 17 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1.  It is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/l or 4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1 or 3/3.  Clay content is 20 to 27 percent. Hard angular gravel content is 2 to 15 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 65 to 100 percent.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/l, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, or 4/6.  Mottles are 7.5YR 5/6, 5/8; 10YR 5/6 or 5/8.  Moist mottle color is 7.5YR 4/6, 5/6, 5/8, 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 5/8, 6/6 or 6/8.  Mottles occur between 50 and 60 inches.  The upper part of the B horizon is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  The lower part is gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 2 to 35 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 75 to 100 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mallopass soils occur on coastal fan terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 50 to 800 feet.  The soil formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 48 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 330 days."

Biaggi soils lack mottling, are well drained and are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Cabrillo soils have mottles between 30 and 50 inches, are somewhat poorly drained and have loamy sand umbric epipedons.  Crispin soils lack mottling, are well drained and are moderately deep to a cemented pan. Flumeville and Windyhollow soils are often in subtle depressions. Flumeville soils have mottles between 10 and 30 inches, are poorly drained and have a clayey particle-size class.  Windyhollow soils have mottles between 30 and 50 inches and are somewhat poorly drained."
