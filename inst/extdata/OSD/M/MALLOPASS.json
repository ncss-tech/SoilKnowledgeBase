  "OVERVIEW": "The Mallopass series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources. Mallopass soils are on marine terraces and coastal fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The epipedon ranges from 0.6 to 4 percent organic carbon, decreasing regularly with increasing depth.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 17 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1.  It is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 30 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/l or 4/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1 or 3/3.  Clay content is 20 to 27 percent. Hard angular gravel content is 2 to 15 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 65 to 100 percent.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 7/2 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 3/l, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, or 4/6.

The upper part of the B horizon is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  The lower part is gravelly loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 2 to 35 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 75 to 100 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

Biaggi soils lack mottling, are well drained and are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Cabrillo soils have mottles between 30 and 50 inches, are somewhat poorly drained and have loamy sand umbric epipedons.  Crispin soils lack mottling, are well drained and are moderately deep to a cemented pan. Flumeville and Windyhollow soils are often in subtle depressions. Flumeville soils have mottles between 10 and 30 inches, are poorly drained and have a clayey particle-size class.  Windyhollow soils have mottles between 30 and 50 inches and are somewhat poorly drained."
