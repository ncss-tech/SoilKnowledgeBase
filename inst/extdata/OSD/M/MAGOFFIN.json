  "OVERVIEW": "The Magoffin series consists of very shallow and shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum from andesite, rhyolite, basalt and felsic volcanic breccia.  Magoffin soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

These soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum from andesite, rhyolite, basalt and felsic volcanic breccia.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 210 days."
