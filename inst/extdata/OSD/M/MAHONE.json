The well drained, fine-loamy, Kaskan soils have a mollic epipedon and cambic which contain more clay, and are on lower flood plain positions closer to streams. The somewhat poorly drained, fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, Imano and sandy Willowbrook soils have a mollic epipedon and are on lower flood plain positions closer to streams. The moderately well drained, fine-loamy Nickerson soils have an argillic horizon and are on nearby terraces. The moderately well drained, sandy Saxman soils do not have buried loamy material above 40 inches (102 centimeters), and are on slightly lower positions."
