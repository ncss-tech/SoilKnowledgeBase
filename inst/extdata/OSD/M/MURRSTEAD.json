  "REVDATE": "11/1999",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Murrstead series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic materials stratified with silty mineral materials.  These soils are in depressions on floodplains in glacial lake basins.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
