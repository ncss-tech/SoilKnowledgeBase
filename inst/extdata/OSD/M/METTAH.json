  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mettah soils occur on moderately broad ridges and upper slopes of mountains. Slopes are 9 to 30 percent. Elevations are 296 to 690 meters (970 to 2260 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial, beach, dune and estuarine deposits derived from mixed sources which have been uplifted. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1780 to 2290 millimeters (70 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 280 days."
