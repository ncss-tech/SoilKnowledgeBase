  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Marcial series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in fine textured alluvial sediments from mixed sources but dominantly from shaly redbeds. Marcial soils are on nearly level fans, floodplains, and floors of lake basins. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",
