  "OVERVIEW": "The Montchief series consists of moderately deep, excessively drained soils with rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and residuum from granitic rocks mixed with volcanic ash. Slopes range from 35 to 90 percent in mountain and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
