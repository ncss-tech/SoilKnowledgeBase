Montvale soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates. Phizphre has few to common fossilized brachiopods. Santa Fe soils are dominated by rock fragments of granite and have a mollic epipedon that extends to the bedrock contact.  Slidymtn soils have an aridic moisture regime that borders on ustic."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes are 2 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 2,595 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual air temperature is 7 to 13 degrees C, the mean summer temperature is 22 to 24 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 180 days."

These soils are extensive with about 193,000 acres of the series mapped to date.  The original series concept, type location, and nearly 40 percent of the mapped acreage is in MLRA 29.  Other mapped acreage occurs in MLRAs 35 and 36 in New Mexico and MLRA 67 in Wyoming.   The soils in New Mexico and Wyoming need to be correlated to other series that better represent their properties and moisture patterns."
