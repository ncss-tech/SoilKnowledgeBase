Akaka soils are moderately well drained with redoximorphic features in the A, Bw, and Bs horizons.  Honokaa soils have silty clay loam textures throughout the profile and do not have an ashy layer near the surface. Honomanu soils have silty clay texture in the B horizons.  Honomanu and Kehena soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Kaiwiki soils are strongly smeary throughout and have a perudic soil moisture regime.  Moaula and Ohia soils are on younger Mauna Loa flows."
