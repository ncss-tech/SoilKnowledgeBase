  "OVERVIEW": "The Maile series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava flows.  Maile soils are on ash fields of mid elevation windward mountain slopes of Mauna Kea and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 1905 millimeters (75 inches) and mean annual temperature is 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
