  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon, thickness of the silty mantle, and depth to the sandy outwash all range from 40 to 60 inches.  The weighted average clay content in the particle size control section ranges from 18 to 25 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  The ratio of coarse silt to fine silt ranges from 1.25 to 2.50 in the silty mantle.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 40 percent in the loamy lower subsoil.  Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 10 percent below it.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon but it ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Free carbonates are absent to a depth of more than 5 feet.  Redoximorphic concentrations typically are throughout the pedon below the A or Ap horizon.  Redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less are at least as high as the upper 10 inches of the argillic.  Aquic conditions occur in the upper 10 inches of the argillic at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated areas have Ap horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Where the value moist is 3 in the Ap horizon, the value dry is greater than 5.5.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nMaplehurst soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.  Some pedons have a Btg horizon, with dominant chroma of 2, below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt horizon (2Bt horizon in pedons without a loamy 2Bt horizon) with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy 2Bt horizon) has color like the 3Bt horizon described above.  It is typically stratified layers of sand or coarse sand or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly.  It averages more than 85 percent sand in the fine earth fraction."
