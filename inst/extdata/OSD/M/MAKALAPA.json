    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the soil over volcanic tuff ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The amount of pebble-size fragments of tuff on the surface and in the soil ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Cracks 2 inches or more wide and 20 to 30 inches deep occur in the soil when it is dry.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 74 degrees F.  Hue of the soil is 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma is 2 through 4 when moist.  The upper part of the C horizon is clay or silty clay."

Kaena soils have chroma of 1 in the upper 12 inches and have mottles throughout.  Kapuhikani soils formed in olivine basalt, and have a torric moisture regime. Kokokahi soils have 2.5Y or yellower hue below the A horizon and are noncalcareous.  Lualualei soils have horizons of gypsum accumulation at depths of less than 40 inches.  Nonopahu soils have kaolinitic mineralogy and are more than 40 inches deep.  Papaa soils are noncalcareous throughout and are more than 40 inches deep."
