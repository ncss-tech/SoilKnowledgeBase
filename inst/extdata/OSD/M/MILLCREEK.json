  "OVERVIEW": "The Millcreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and quartzite.  Millcreek soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
