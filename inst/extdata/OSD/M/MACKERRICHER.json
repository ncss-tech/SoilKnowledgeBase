The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean winter and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 3 to 6 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 9 and 36 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to August 1 and is dry in some part from September 1 to October 1 in most years.  Organic carbon content in the upper cubic meter of soil ranges from 12 to 15kg.  Less than 50 percent base saturation in some subhorizon between 10 and 40 inches.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2; 7.5YR 2/2 or 3/2.  Clay content is 6 to 12 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) is 40 to 70 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.  Organic carbon content ranges from 1.0 to 4.0 percent.  Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 7 to 15 inches.\nThe Bw horizon is 7.5YR 4/4 or 4/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/4.  Clay content is 4 to 12 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) is 25 to 50 percent.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 4/4 or 4/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, or 4/6.  It is loamy sand or sand.  Clay content is 2 to 8 percent.  Nodule content (2-50mm in diameter) ranges from 0 to 10 percent.

The climate is characterized by cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 55 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F., mean July temperature is 57 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the closely related Heeser and Sirdrak soils and the Branscomb, Cabrillo, Sirdrak and Usal soils.  Branscomb and Usal soils are on mountains adjacent to the marine terraces on which Mackerricher soils are found.  Branscomb soils are loamy skeletal.  Heeser soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section and an ustic soil moisture regime.  Sirdrak soils have an ustic soil moisture regime and do not have as much as 12kg organic carbon in the upper cubic meter of the soil.  Usal soils are fine-loamy and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Cabrillo and Heeser soils are on marine terraces.  They are on slightly older landscapes.  Cabrillo soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and Heeser soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  Sirdrak soils are on sand dunes thought to be slightly younger than those on which Mackerricher soils have formed.  Sirdrak soils support grass vegetation, have an ustic soil moisture regime and do not contain as much as 12kg organic carbon in the upper cubic meter of the soil."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification was updated in February 2001 using the Eighth Edition to Soil Taxonomy. This series was formerly classified as sandy, mixed, isomesic Typic Humitropepts. The range of characteristics for the A horizon causes this series to fall into two classifications, soils with a thin (less than 10 inch) sandy loam horizon will have sandy textures throughout the textural control section which classify as Humic Psammentic Dystrudepts. Soils with sandy loam textures extending into the control section will classify as Humic Dystrudepts. Competing series were not checked at that time.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon -- the zone from 0 to 12 inches (A1, A2)\nMany areas mapped as Mackerricher soils were mapped as Empire soils by the California Soil Vegetation Survey 1947-1950.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
