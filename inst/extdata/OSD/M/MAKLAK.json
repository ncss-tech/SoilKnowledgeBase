The solum is 14 to 35 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section is dominated by pumice mixed with minor amounts of cinders and average 35 to 80 percent.   Field estimated clay is 0 to 5 percent.  The solum has 70 to 100 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregates, 25 to 50 percent phosphate retention, 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, and 3 to 12 percent 15-bar moisture based on an air-dried and moist samples.  The fine-earth includes appreciable amounts of lithic crystal ash.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  It has 15 to 25 percent paragravel pumice.  Moist bulk density is 0.70 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe Bw and C horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 through 7 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 8 moist and 0 through 6 dry.  Pumice fragments typically have variegated hue of 7.5YR and 5YR and chroma of 4 or more.  It is very paragravelly ashy loamy coarse sand or extremely paragravelly ashy loamy coarse sand with 30 to 60 percent pragravel pumice and 15 to 25 percent paracobble pumice.  Moist bulk density is 0.70 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe C horizon has 70 to 100 percent glass."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lapine and Wedge series.  Lapine soils lack cobble-size pumice and have little lithic crystal ash (hypersthene, augite, dark green hornblende) in the control section.  Wedge soils have acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 2.0 percent, and have a spodic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maklak soils are on gently to strongly sloping pumice flows in narrow glacial valleys and lava tablelands.  Elevations range from 4,350 to 7,000 feet.  The soils formed in very thick deposits of pumice and ash.  The materials predominantly are dacitic.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold winters with much snow.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  The mean annual January temperature is 25 to 27 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 56 to 62 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 38 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 0 to 50 days."
