The soil is dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The control section contains 5 to 35 percent fine, angular, granitic pebbles.\nThe A horizon, where present, has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist. Texture is ashy silt loam, ashy loam, or ashy sandy loam. Pebble content ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. Texture is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. Pebble content ranges from 5 to 25 percent.

Aits, Bercumb, Roslyn, and Smith soils are very deep. In addition Aits soils have a hard and firm silt loam, loam, or sandy loam 2B horizon in the lower part of the control section. Leadpoint, Moscow, Ojibway, Osborn, and Volperie soils have a paralithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches. Moonville and Waits soils have free carbonates in the lower part of the control section. Roslyn soils are loamy throughout the control section and lack the very gravelly coarse sand or very gravelly loamy coarse sand 2C horizon. Apex, Canteen and Centralpeak soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days. Osborn soils have less than 5 percent hard rock fragments and average 20 to 50 percent soft sandstone fragments. Volperie soils have 5 to 15 percent mica by weight in the fine earth fraction."
