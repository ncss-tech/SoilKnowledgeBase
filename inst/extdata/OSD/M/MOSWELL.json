    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 60 to 65 percent. Depth to slickensides ranges from 10 to 20 inches. When dry the subsoil has cracks 1/2 inch wide that extend to a depth of more than 12 inches. The cracks are open for less than 90 cumulative days in most years. The salinity ranges from very slight to moderate from the mid-parts of the subsoil into the C horizon. The redox features are mainly relic or lithochromic. This soil does not have aquic soil conditions in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is a fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction ranges from to very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Some pedons have a few redox concentrations in shades of brown. Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Combined thickness of the A and E horizons is 4 to 12 inches.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Redox concentrations in shades of brown or yellow range from none to common and redox depletions range from none to common. Texture is clay. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Btss or Btssy horizon typically is variegated in shades of gray, red, yellow, and brown; or it has a matrix with hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3; or hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is clay. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid. Gypsum crystals in masses range from common to many in some pedons. Gypsum makes up 5 to 15 percent in the lower subhorizons of some pedons. Barite masses range from few to common in some pedons. SAR ranges from 4 to 12 percent.\nThe Cy or C horizon is shale with texture of clay. The colors are variable, but are mainly in shades of olive, gray, brown, or yellow. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid. Crystals or masses of gypsum, barite, jarosite and natrojarosite are in some pedons. SAR ranges from 4 to 16 in most pedons."

Chisca soils are in limestone valleys, and have soft alkaline shale bedrock within a depth of 60 inches.  Natchitoches soils formed from thick deposits of sediments high in glauconitic sand and are less acid in the substratum.  Etoile and Woodtell soils have less than 60 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon and are less acid in the subsoil and substratum.  Lacerda and Raylake soils are vertisols and are less acid in the substratum.  Lyerly soils have mixed mineralogy and have limestone bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Naclina, Oktibbeha, and Vaiden soils are vertisols and are less acid in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum."
