  "OVERVIEW": "The Magpie series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. These soils occur on stream terraces, fan remnants and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
