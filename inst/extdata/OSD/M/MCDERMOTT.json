These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section (6 to 19 inches) from June 1 to November 15 (167 days) and moist in all parts from December 1 to April 15.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 1 to December 1 (275 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F from April 15 to November 1.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 7/2, 6/2, 2.5Y 8/2, 7/2 or 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 3/2, 2.5Y 6/4, 5/4, 5/2, 4/4 or 4/2.  It is noneffervescent to strongly effervescent.\nThe BAtkn and 2Btkn horizons are 10YR 7/3, 6/3; 2.5Y 8/2, 7/2, 7/4, 6/2 or 5Y 6/3.
