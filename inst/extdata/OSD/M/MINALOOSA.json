  "OVERVIEW": "The Minaloosa series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess mixed with residuum and colluvium from metasedimentary rock. Minaloosa soils are on hills and uplands and have slopes of 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
