  "OVERVIEW": "The Millhi series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in lacustrine sediments with a thin mantle of slope alluvium.  Millhi soils are on foothills and dissected lacustrine terraces and have slopes of 2 to 35 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
