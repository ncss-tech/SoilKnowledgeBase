  "OVERVIEW": "The Markland series consists of very deep, well drained soils on lake plains. They formed in thin loess and the underlying calcareous, fine-textured lacustrine sediments. Slopes are commonly 12 to 50 percent, but range from 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches).",

Bledsoe, Bonnell, Lowell, Mountpleasant, Muncie, and Vandalia soils have rock fragments in some part of the series control section. Brashear soils have redoximorphic features (depletions) in the middle and lower part of the series control section. Briggsville soils average less than 53 degrees in the soil temperature control section. Kewaunee soils have hue redder than 7.5YR in the argillic horizon.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Markland soils are commonly on risers of dissected lake plains, and less commonly treads. The slope gradient commonly is 12 to 50 percent, but ranges from 2 to 70 percent. The soil formed in 8 to 46 cm (3 to 18 inches) of loess and the underlying calcareous, fine-textured lacustrine sediments. Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free days range from 150 to 210."

They typically are on treads or flats of lake plains. The moderately well drained Shircliff soils are on treads. The somewhat poorly drained McGary soils are on flats, and the very poorly drained Zipp soils are on flats or in very shallow depressions."

This soil on risers is subject to rare periods of flooding."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series was revised in 1995, and the series concept is defined to only include soils that have no water table above 6 feet. The type location is moved to a more typical area in Perry County, IN. Mineralogy data from the typical pedon indicates that it could be in the illitic class, but it will remain in the mixed class until it is evaluated throughout the extent of the series.\nDiagnostic surface and subsurface horizons recognized in this pedon are: 1) Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 10 cm (0 to 4 inches) (A horizon); 2) Argillic horizon: the zone from 10 to 150 cm (4 to 59 inches) (2Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Btk1, 2Btk2, 2Btk3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data on the typical pedon S92IN123-3 is at the NSSC, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
