  "OVERVIEW": "The Malpaispring series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in gypsiferous eolian deposits. These nearly level soils are on salt marshes. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
