  "OVERVIEW": "The Maxville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
