  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 65 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F. at any time.  Soil between the depths of about 8 and 20 inches is usually moist in some or all parts from December to about the middle of May and usually is dry all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments, mostly mineral grains 2 to 5 mm. in diameter, range from 5 to 35 percent and tend to be more numerous in the lower part of the profile.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, brown, reddish brown or yellowish red, and the hue is 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR.  It is sandy loam or loam and is neutral or slightly acid.  This horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure or it is hard or very hard and massive when dry.  The average organic matter is less than 1 percent.\nThe B2t horizon is brown or strong brown in 7.5YR hue or reddish brown or dark reddish brown in 5YR hue.  It is sandy clay loam or less commonly clay loam and contains 27 to 35 percent clay.  The upper boundary of the B2t horizon is abrupt and contains at least 10 percent more clay absolute than the overlying horizon.  Some pedons have a very thin A2 horizon.  The B2t horizon has moderate to strong prismatic or angular blocky structure and usually the prismatic structure is in the upper part grading to angular blocky in the lower part.  It is slightly acid to neutral and base saturation is 75 to 95 percent.\nThe upper Csim horizon is indurated and the upper surface has a smooth opal coating on more than half of the area.  Other parts of the Csi horizon are strongly cemented, but layered and variable and some plates are indurated.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The lower boundary of the main Csi horizon is smooth or wavy and highly irregular with silica apparently moving down along vertical planes into unconsolidated sediments.  Dendritic deposits of manganese oxide and small amounts of calcium carbonate are in fracture planes in some pedons.  Holes or \"windows\" occur in the pan.   The lower part of the C horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arlington, Buchenau, Buren, Exeter, Gloria, Igo, Redding, Rocklin, San Joaquin, and Ysidora series.  Arlington, Buren, and Ysidora soils lack strong cementation in the duripans.  Buchenau soils are calcareous in the B2t horizon and have lime and silica cementation.  Exeter and Rocklin soils have less than 27 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  (See Remarks.) Gloria, Redding, and San Joaquin soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Igo soils are 3 to 12 inches deep to a duripan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Monserate soils are on nearly level to moderately steep old dissected terraces and fans at elevations of 700 to 2,500 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium derived principally from granitic rocks.  The climate is dry subhumid mesothermal with long dry summers and mild moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  Average January temperature is 48 degrees to 52 degrees F., average July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 62 degrees to 65 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 230 to 280 days."

Fallbrook and Vista soils have a paralithic contact.  Hanford soils lack an argillic horizon.  Greenfield soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Placentia soils have a fine textured natric horizon."
