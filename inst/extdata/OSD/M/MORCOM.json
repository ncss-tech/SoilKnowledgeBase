  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Morcom series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in a mantle of outwash or glacial lake beach sediments and underlying clayey glacial lake sediments. They are on outwash terraces or glacial lake beaches on lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2B/E or 2Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy clay loam, loam or clay loam. Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. 2B/E horizons have less than 15 percent E  or Bt material.  Pedons that do not have a 2B/E horizon have a 2Bt horizon.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4.
