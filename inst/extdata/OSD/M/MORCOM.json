    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to free carbonates ranges from 28 to 65 inches. The mantle ranges from 18 to 36 inches in thickness. The mantle has 0 to 5 percent gravel. The underlying material typically does not contain rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2B/E or 2Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy clay loam, loam or clay loam. Clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. 2B/E horizons have less than 15 percent E  or Bt material.  Pedons that do not have a 2B/E horizon have a 2Bt horizon.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is clay or silty clay. Clay content averages 50 to 80 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 3Bk and 3C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is clay or silty clay. Thin varves of very fine sandy loam, silt loam or silty clay loam may occur. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Morcom soils are on convex to linear surfaces of outwash terraces and glacial beaches on lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. They formed in a mantle of outwash or glacial beach sediments and underlying clayey glacial lake sediments. Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. Elevation above sea level is 1000 to 1600 feet."
