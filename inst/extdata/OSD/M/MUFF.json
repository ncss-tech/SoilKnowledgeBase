  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to soft bedrock and paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  Depth to continuous horizons of carbonate accumulation ranges from 6 to 25 inches.  These soils may be effervescent at the surface but are typically leached free of carbonates in the A and upper B horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  ESP ranges from 5 to 30. EC ranges from 2 to 4 mmhos.  Reaction is mildly through very strongly alkaline.\nThe Btn and Btnk horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  This horizon meets the diagnostic properties of a natric horizon.  Texture is typically clay loam or sandy clay loam but may be a loam.  Clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, sand from 20 to 60 percent, and silt from  10 to 50 percent.  ESP ranges from  15 to 45 percent when averaged for this horizon.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.  EC ranges from 4 to 8 mmhos.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with clay content from 10 to 30 percent.   Calcium carbonate and gypsum are segregated and occur as few or common soft masses, threads, and filaments.  Carbonates range from 4 to 15 percent throughout but morphologically do not meet the qualifications of a diagnostic calcic horizon.  ESP ranges from 8 to 35 percent.  EC is 4 to 8 mmhos. Reaction is strongly or very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam or loam.  Calcium carbonate and gypsum are mostly disseminated with few segregated soft masses, threads, or filaments.  Carbonates range from 4 to 12 percent. ESP ranges from 8 to 15 percent and EC from 4 to 15 mmhos.\nThe Cr horizon consists of soft sodic shale interbedded with thin lenses of sandstone.  The shale ranges from yellowish brown to olive and contains large amounts of quartz.  Thin lenses of visible salts of sodium, gypsum, and carbonates are common between the shale plates. This material extends to over 80 inches and is estimated to extend to over 15 feet in most areas."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Benally, Fajada(T), Hadden(T), Highrock(T), Homko, Leebench, Leeko, Pizene, Recapture, Rusty, Swasey, Terlco and Uffens series. Benally and Fajada soils are intermittently moist in some part of the moisture control section from July to October and are driest in May and June. Hadden soils are dry in the moisture control section from late May through August. Highrock, Homko, Leebench, Leeko, Pizene, Recapture, Rusty, Terlco and Uffens soils have bedrock deeper than 40 inches.  Swasey soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Muff soils are on rolling hills, plains, strath terraces and benches.  These soils formed in residuum, and slope alluvium weathered from sodic shale and sandstone. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 6,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 5 to about 10 inches of which about half falls as rain or snow in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., but ranges from 43 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 110 to about 140 days depending upon aspect, air drainage, and elevation."
