  "OVERVIEW": "The McVegas series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from metavolcanic and volcanic rocks.  These soils are on hills.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
