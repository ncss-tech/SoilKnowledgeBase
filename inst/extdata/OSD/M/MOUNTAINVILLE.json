In more than 7 out of 10 years the soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days between June 21 and September 21, and are dry in the moisture control section 50 to 55 percent of the time. Soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. in most years. The moisture control section is moist for 60 to 70 consecutive days during the 120 days after the winter solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.
