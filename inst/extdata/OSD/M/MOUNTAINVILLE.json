    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is 22 to 38 inches thick. Coarse fragments in the control section range from 35 to 70 percent and are mainly stone. The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 47 to 49 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F. In more than 7 out of 10 years the soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days between June 21 and September 21, and are dry in the moisture control section 50 to 55 percent of the time. Soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. in most years. The moisture control section is moist for 60 to 70 consecutive days during the 120 days after the winter solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It ranges from stony or very stony sandy clay loam to stony or very stony clay loam, with 35 to 80 percent coarse fragments, dominantly stone size. This horizon has few faint to common distinct clay films on faces of peds and on coarse fragments.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It ranges from stony or very stony sandy clay loam to stony or very stony fine sandy loam, with 35 to 75 percent coarse fragments, mainly stone size. This horizon is moderately to strongly alkaline, strongly to very strongly calcareous."

Broad, Holmes, Horrocks and Hoskin soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 47 degrees F. and are usually moist.  Butterfield and Ridd soils are moist in the moisture control section more than one-half of the time soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  Collard and Tollgate soils lack calcic horizons. Red Butte soils lack stones or boulders in the control section.  Walsey soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 58 degrees F. and and have a depth to bedrock of 20 to 40 inches."
