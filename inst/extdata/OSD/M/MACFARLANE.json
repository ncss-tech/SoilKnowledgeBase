  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Mean annual soil temperature is about 34 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is about 43 degrees F. Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon. Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 55 inches. Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent in a major part of the solum and any C and are mainly 10 to 24 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. It ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6. It ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is extremely stony sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 5 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. This horizon ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR; subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons. This horizon ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

Gambler and Kebler soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Granile, Larand, and Tuckerville soils have argillic horizons with more than 18 percent clay in the fine earth fraction. Kurrie soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches. Leadville soils have lithochromic hue of 5YR or redder and have more than 18 percent clay in the fine earth fraction of the Bt and C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: MacFarlane soils are on moderately to steeply sloping alluvial fans and hillsides. Slopes typically range from 4 percent to about 50 percent. The soil formed in thick, noncalcareous, extremely stony moderately coarse textured materials derived principally from gneiss, schist, and quartizite. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. Mean annual temperature is 30 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 42 degrees F."
