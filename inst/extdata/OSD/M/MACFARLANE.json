  "OVERVIEW": "The MacFarlane series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in thick, noncalcareous, extremely stony moderately coarse textured materials derived principally from gneiss, schist, and quartizite. They are on sloping to steep alluvial fans and hillsides. Slopes typically range from 4 percent to about 50 percent. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. Mean annual temperature is 30 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 42 degrees F.",

Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon. Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 55 inches. Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent in a major part of the solum and any C and are mainly 10 to 24 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon, if present, has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. It ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6. It ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is extremely stony sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 5 to 75 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand. This horizon ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR; subhorizons redder than 7.5YR occur in some pedons. This horizon ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline."
