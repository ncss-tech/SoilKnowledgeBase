  "OVERVIEW": "The Mullen series consists of very deep well drained soils formed in eolian sands over loamy eolian deposits. Mullen soils are on interdunes of sandhills. These soils have slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 48 centimeters (19 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 9.5 degrees C (49 degrees F) at the type location.",
