  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock is 40 to more than 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 to 24 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 20 inches thick.  The particle size control section is dominantly silt loam and has more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand and 5 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, gravelly loam or gravelly silt loam.  This horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and in most pedons is calcareous.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through.   It is silt loam, loam, gravelly silt loam or gravelly loam.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has the same ranges as the B horizon except that there are thin organic coatings, and thin patchy clay films on the upper surfaces of the plates.  In some pedons the platy structure is lacking and the C horizon is massive."

The soil formed in glacial till, glacial lake sediments and calcareous shale with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The average annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  The frost free season (32 degrees F.) is 100 to 130 days."
