  "OVERVIEW": "The Miasotus series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in schist. Miasotus soils are on hills and mountains on islands. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (457 millimeters) and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees (14 degrees C.)",
