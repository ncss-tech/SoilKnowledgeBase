  "OVERVIEW": "The Maule series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on plateau tops and mountain sideslopes.  They formed in volcanic ash and colluvium over residuum from rhyolitic tuff.  Slopes are 5 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
