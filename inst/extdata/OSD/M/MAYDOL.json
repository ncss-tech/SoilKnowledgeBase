  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Maydol soils are on plateaus at elevations of 2,000 to 3,200 feet. Slopes are 5 to 30 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from Simcoe or Yakima basalt mixed with loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash in the surface. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 22 to 27 inches. The average January temperature is 27 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 140 days."

Nook soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick. Presher soils are frigid. Rockly soils are shallow to basalt. Lyville and Suta soils are on canyon side slopes.  Nook soils are on alluvial fans and terraces.  Presher soils are on plateaus and footslopes of mountains.  Rockly soils are on plateaus, canyon slopes, and hillslopes.  Satus soils are on mountain slopes."
