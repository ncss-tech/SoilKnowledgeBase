  "OVERVIEW": "The Maydol series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from basalt with minor amounts of loess and volcanic ash. Maydol soils are on plateaus. Slopes are 5 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Nook soils are on alluvial fans and terraces.  Presher soils are on plateaus and footslopes of mountains.  Rockly soils are on plateaus, canyon slopes, and hillslopes.  Satus soils are on mountain slopes."
