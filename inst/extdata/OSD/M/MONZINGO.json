  "OVERVIEW": "The Monzingo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from prehistoric lakes and marshes.  Monzingo soils are on dissected relict lake beds.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
