  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick and includes part of the argillic horizon.   Depth to highly fractured, serpentine bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The soil is usually moist, but is dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  The depth to the argillic horizon is 6 to 20 inches. The serpentine rock fragments are strongly cemented to indurated but some rocks may shatter due to fracturing and faulting.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is stony loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 15 percent stones, 0 to 15 cobbles, and 5 to 15 gravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is very stony clay, very cobbly clay loam, or very gravelly clay loam and has 35 to 60 percent clay and averages 35 to 55 percent serpentine rock fragments. It has 5 to 25 percent stones, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 5 to 25 percent gravel.  This horizon has common or many and faint or distinct clay films and is neutral or slightly  alkaline."

They occur on mountain slopes and formed in colluvium and residuum from serpentine and ultramafic rocks.  The slopes are 10 to 50 percent.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 30 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Lemonex and Overholt(T) soils in the areas containing serpentine and Hankins, Ruddley, and Alding soils in areas of volcanic or metavolcanic bedrock.  These soils are all frigid and occur at slightly lower elevations or adjacent steep, south slopes.  The Lemonex soils are on lower, forested footslopes of mountains.  The Overholt soils are in rangeland and on lower ridgetops and shoulders or south slopes adjacent to serpentine rock exposures.  The Overholt soils are very shallow.  The Hankins, Ruddley, and Alding soils lack a magnesic influence.  The Hankins soils are on lower, forested footslopes of mountains dominated by ponderosa pine.  The Ruddley soils are on lower, moderately deep side slopes of mountains dominated by Douglas fir.  The Alding soils are on lower, shallow side slopes of mountains dominated by ponderosa pine."
