  "OVERVIEW": "The Matoon series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in fine sediments deposited in marine environments. They are in marine basins where the underlying bedrock is 20 to 40 inches below the soil surface. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is 1000 mm.",

Rock fragments, mostly gravel or cobbles, range from 0 to 2 percent in the A and upper B horizons and from 0 to 20 percent in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral in the surface layer, neutral or slightly alkaline in the subsoil, and neutral to moderately alkaline where the substratum is present.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. This horizon commonly is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction, and less commonly is varved with silt and very fine sand. Some pedons have a thin layer of Saprolite above the rock. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2R horizon is sandstone, dolomitic sandstone, or limestone bedrock."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C.; mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1490 mm; and the frost-free period ranges from 100 to 160 days.

The very deep Adjidaumo and the moderately deep Guff soils are in shallow wet depressions and do not have an argillic horizon. Heuvelton soils are on knolls and are very deep to bedrock. Muskellunge soils are on similar landscape positions but are very deep to bedrock. Insula and Summerville soils are on adjacent benches or terraces and are shallow to bedrock. Nehasne soils are on higher topographic positions and have coarser textures. Ogdensburg soils are in similar topographic positions but have coarser textures."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Original classification placed Matoon as a Ochraqualf, but because of changes in the 5th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy this soil now classifies into the great group of Endoaqualfs. Some competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 30 cm (Ap and BEg horizons).\n2) Argillic horizon - from 30 to 69 cm (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).\n3) Aqualfs suborder - as evidenced by low chroma, reduced ped faces and/or matrices and redoximorphic features in the upper part of the argillic horizon (Btg1 horizon)\n4) Aeric subgroup - from 20 to 30 cm as evidenced by a subhorizon within 76 cm of the soil surface that has dominant (50 percent or more) chroma of 3 or more with redoximorphic features present (BEg horizon)\nSoil Interpretation Record: NY0359"
