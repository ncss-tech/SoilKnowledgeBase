  "OVERVIEW": "The Manzanola series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvial materials derived from sedimentary rock.  Manzanola soils are on fans, valley side slopes, drainageways, plains, and stream terraces.  Slope gradients are 0 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
