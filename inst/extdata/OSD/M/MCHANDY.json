Elevations range from 3,600 to 4,400 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F. and the frost free period is 100 to 120 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  On plateaus, McHandy soils occur with the following soils: Catchell soils, on ridges; Chilcott and Thorncreek soils, in concave positions; and Power soils, on mounds.  Chilcott, Catchell and Power soils have argillic horizons and lack vertic properties.  Thorncreek soils are deep to bedrock and have less well developed vertic properties.  On escarpments, McHandy soils are on footslopes and Hobby soils are on middle and upper sideslopes.  Hobby soils are moderately deep to bedrock, have mollic epipedons and have less well developed vertic properties than McHandy soils."
