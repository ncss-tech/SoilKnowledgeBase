  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Texture of the solum includes silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogs of these textures. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent as a weighted average throughout.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 25 percent and volume of cobbles and stones ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout. The pedon ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bhs horizon has value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.\nThe 2E/Bx horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or gravelly or cobbly analogs of these textures.   Fragic properties commonly occupy 30 to 60 percent of the 2E/B horizon, but range to above 60 percent when the horizon thickness is less than 6 inches.\nSome pedons have a 2B/Ex horizon with colors and textures similar to the 2E/B horizon.\nSome pedons have 2C or 2Cx horizons.  They are firm and have fragipan-like characteristics in some pedons.\nThe underlying bedrock is typically igneous or metamorphic but less commonly is conglomerate."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  The closely related Dishno soil is moderately well drained and has a lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches.  The Peshekee and Arcadian soils have a lithic contact between 10 and 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Michigamme soils are on ground moraines which have a thin mantle of silty or loamy material over glacial till, underlain by bedrock.  Slopes range from 1 to 75 percent, but are typically greater than 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation of 26 to 33 inches and the mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the moderately well drained, very deep, Champion, Gogebic, and Wakefield soils on ground moraines.  The well drained Schweitzer is associated in steeply sloping areas. The deep, moderately well drained Dishno soil is a common associate on less steep areas."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained. Surface runoff is medium to high, dependent on slope.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow or very slow in the lower part."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  A few areas are cleared and used for hay and pasture. Most areas of Michigamme soil are in second growth timber and support stands of sugar maple and red maple, yellow birch, eastern hemlock, paper birch, and aspen."

(E/Bx horizon).\nThe moderately well drained phase is no longer within the series concept.\nThe series classification was changed to reflect additional observations of the series across its geographic range.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to S78MI-013-007 for lab data on the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
