  "STATES": "MI,MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Michigamme series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in a silty or loamy mantle over loamy glacial till underlain by igneous or metamorphic bedrock. These soils are on ground moraines. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and slow or very slow in the lower part.  Slopes range from 1 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Texture of the solum includes silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogs of these textures. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent as a weighted average throughout.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 25 percent and volume of cobbles and stones ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout. The pedon ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 1 to 3.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bhs horizon has value and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.\nThe 2E/Bx horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or gravelly or cobbly analogs of these textures.   Fragic properties commonly occupy 30 to 60 percent of the 2E/B horizon, but range to above 60 percent when the horizon thickness is less than 6 inches.\nSome pedons have a 2B/Ex horizon with colors and textures similar to the 2E/B horizon.\nSome pedons have 2C or 2Cx horizons.  They are firm and have fragipan-like characteristics in some pedons.\nThe underlying bedrock is typically igneous or metamorphic but less commonly is conglomerate."
