  "OVERVIEW": "The McMannamy series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous till. These soils are on moraines in glaciated valleys and mountain slopes. Slopes are 4 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

They have an udic moisture regime and are moderately deep to carbonates. Jimlake soils occur on concave, north sloping aspects above 4300 feet elevation. They generally have a thick ash mantle, cryic soil temperature regime, and are deep or very deep to carbonates."
