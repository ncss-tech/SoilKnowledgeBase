They are shallow to carbonates and lack an argillic horizon. Foyslake soils are dominantly on north facing aspects below 4500 feet elevation. They have an udic moisture regime and are moderately deep to carbonates. Jimlake soils occur on concave, north sloping aspects above 4300 feet elevation. They generally have a thick ash mantle, cryic soil temperature regime, and are deep or very deep to carbonates."
