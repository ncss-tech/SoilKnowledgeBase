Aymate soils have silica cementation in the petrocalcic horizon and in addition they receive 5 to 8 inches precipitation.  Hilken soils mean annual temperature range from 58 to 60 degrees and the Bk horizon contains 15 to 60 percent rock fragment by volume, 15 to 55 percent pebbles, 0 to 5 percent cobbles."

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 12 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September.  The driest months are March and April.  Precipitation during the months of January, February, and March is less than 13 percent of the total.
