  "OVERVIEW": "The soils of the Met series are moderately deep to a duripan and are well-drained and high in carbonates. They are on broad, dissected alluvial fans. They formed in alluvium, mainly from limestone, over gravelly lacustrine sediments. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 56 F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 69 to 75 F. pH values range erratically from 8.1 to 9.6.  The control section is stratified with very fine sandy loam, loam and fine sandy loam that contain up to 65 percent gravel in some strata. It averages less than 10 percent noncarbonate clay, 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments, and 40 to 55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe Al horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4. It has weak or moderate, thin to thick platy structure in the upper part, and weak or moderate fine or very fine granular structure in the lower part, or the horizon is massive. Organic carbon is less than 0.5 percent and to a depth of 15 inches averages less than 0.35 percent.\nThe Csica horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. It has thin to thick silica and lime coatings on coarse fragments, and few to many very thin to thin discontinuous silica-lime laminae or bridges between sand grains.\nThe Csicam horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It has discontinuous silica-lime laminae up to 5 mm thick. This horizon is extremely hard or very hard and extremely firm or very firm."
