  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the strongly cemented duripan is 28 to 40 inches. An indurated duripan is at depths of 41 to 54 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 53 to 56 F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 69 to 75 F. pH values range erratically from 8.1 to 9.6.  The control section is stratified with very fine sandy loam, loam and fine sandy loam that contain up to 65 percent gravel in some strata. It averages less than 10 percent noncarbonate clay, 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments, and 40 to 55 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe Al horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4. It has weak or moderate, thin to thick platy structure in the upper part, and weak or moderate fine or very fine granular structure in the lower part, or the horizon is massive. Organic carbon is less than 0.5 percent and to a depth of 15 inches averages less than 0.35 percent.\nThe Csica horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4. It has thin to thick silica and lime coatings on coarse fragments, and few to many very thin to thin discontinuous silica-lime laminae or bridges between sand grains.\nThe Csicam horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It has discontinuous silica-lime laminae up to 5 mm thick. This horizon is extremely hard or very hard and extremely firm or very firm."

Slope gradients range from O to 4 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvium mainly from limestone and some quartzite superimposed over gravelly lacustrine sediments high in pyroclastic materials. The climate is semiarid with mean annual temperature of 50 to 53 F. mean summer temperature of 67 to 73 F., and mean annual precipitation of 7 to 8 inches."

Linco soils lack duripans. Pioche soils have argillic horizons and bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches.  Ursine soils have loamy-skeletal control sections and indurated duripans."
