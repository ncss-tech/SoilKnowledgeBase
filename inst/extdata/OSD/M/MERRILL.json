  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the horizon of maximum lime accumulation ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 59 degrees to 63 degrees F.  The soil becomes moist in some part between depths of 4 and 12 inches about November 15 and remains moist until about May 20.  Unless irrigated, it is dry the rest of the year under present drained conditions.  The soil is moderately or strongly alkaline throughout.  Dominant textures are silt loam or loam with about 20 to 30 percent clay in most horizons.  The 10-to 40-inch control section has 6 to 20 percent sand coarser than very fine sand and averages 7 to 15 percent.  It contains less than 1 percent rock fragments.  The upper A horizons that have properties of a mollic epipedon are gray, dark gray, dark grayish brown or grayish brown in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, and are 13 to 20 inches thick.  They have crumb to subangular blocky structure.  The C horizon is gray, light gray or light brownish gray in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  It has hard to extremely hard lime segregations."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bayshore, Castro, Domino, Patway, Sunnyvale, and Sunrise series.  Bayshore soils have a seasonal water table above a depth of 25 inches and have fine-loamy control sections.  Castro and Sunnyvale soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Domino soils have an ochric epipedon.  Patway soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F. and have coarse-loamy control sections.  Sunrise soils have an ochric epipedon and an aridic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  Merrill soils are on nearly level flood plains at elevations of 500 to 2,400 feet.  They formed in silty material from granitic sources.  The climate is semiarid mesothermal with an average annual precipitation of 10 to 20 inches.  The average annual temperature is 62 degrees to 65 degrees F.; average January temperature is 44 degrees to 52 degrees F., and average July temperature is 71 degrees to 80 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 230 to 280 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Chino, Grangeville, and Hilmar soils.  Chino soils lack a calcic horizon and hard lime concretions.  Grangeville soils are coarse-loamy and lack hard lime concretions.  Hilmar soils are sandy over loamy and lack a calcic horizon."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; slow runoff; moderately slow to slow permeability.  Improvement in drainage by pumping for irrigation has lowered the water table.  Prior to drainage, these soils were saturated to within 25 or 35 inches of the surface in most years from January until July."
