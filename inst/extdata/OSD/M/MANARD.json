  "OVERVIEW": "The Manard series consists of moderately deep well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt and welded tuff on lava plains and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Permeability is very slow.  The average annual precipitation is a bout 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
