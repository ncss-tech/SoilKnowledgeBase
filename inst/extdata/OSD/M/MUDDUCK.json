  "REVDATE": "04/2016",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudduck series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium derived from sandstone and shale. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 8 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degrees C.",
