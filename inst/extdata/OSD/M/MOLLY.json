  "OVERVIEW": "The Molly series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from granite, gneiss, and schist with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. Molly soils are on rolling to very steep mountains. The slopes are 5 to 65 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
