    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Molly soils are on rolling to very steep mountains at elevations of 3,200 to 6,000 feet. Slopes are dominantly 5 to 65 percent. The soils formed in residuum from granite, gneiss, and schist with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part. The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches and the average annual temperature is about 36 degrees to 44 degrees F. The frost free season is about 60 to 100 days."
