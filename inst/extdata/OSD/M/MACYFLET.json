    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Macyflet soils are on interplateau basins.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived mainly from volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,740 to 1,895 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
