  "OVERVIEW": "The Macyflet series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived mainly from volcanic rocks.  Macyflet soils are on interplateau basins.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
