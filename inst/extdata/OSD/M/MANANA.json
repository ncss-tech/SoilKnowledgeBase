Depth to the thin panlike sheet ranges from 15 to 50 inches, except it may be less than 15 inches in small eroded areas .\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  The texture is silty clay or silty clay loam.  Effervescence with hydrogen peroxide is none to slight, and reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe B horizon below the thin panlike sheet has hue of 5YR through 10R; the red hue is normally in the upper part.  The B horizon is silty clay or clay."

Hamakuapoko soils have an umbric epipedon, 10YR hue in the A horizon and 7.5YR or 10YR hue in the B horizon, and do not have a panlike layer in the B horizon.  Ioleau soils have patchy clay films in the argillic horizon and do not have a panlike layer in the B horizon.\nThe Honolua and Makawao series are similar.  Honolua soils have thick patchy clay films and are strongly acid in the argillic horizon. Makawao soils do not have a panlike layer in the B horizon."
