    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The size and number of highly weathered rock fragments vary considerably within short distances.  Depth to the thin panlike sheet ranges from 15 to 50 inches, except it may be less than 15 inches in small eroded areas .\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  The texture is silty clay or silty clay loam.  Effervescence with hydrogen peroxide is none to slight, and reaction ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid.\nThe B horizon below the thin panlike sheet has hue of 5YR through 10R; the red hue is normally in the upper part.  The B horizon is silty clay or clay."

Hamakuapoko soils have an umbric epipedon, 10YR hue in the A horizon and 7.5YR or 10YR hue in the B horizon, and do not have a panlike layer in the B horizon.  Ioleau soils have patchy clay films in the argillic horizon and do not have a panlike layer in the B horizon.\nThe Honolua and Makawao series are similar.  Honolua soils have thick patchy clay films and are strongly acid in the argillic horizon. Makawao soils do not have a panlike layer in the B horizon."

Manana soils formed in material weathered from basic igneous rocks.  Mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.; average January temperature is 68 degrees F.; and average July temperature is 74 degrees F.  Mean annual rainfall is 40 to 60 inches."

Paaloa soils have clay films throughout the B horizon and do not have a panlike layer in the B horizon.  Wahiawa soils do not have an argillic horizon and effervesce with hydrogen peroxide throughout the solum."
