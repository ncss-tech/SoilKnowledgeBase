Other soils in closely related families are Brownwood, Cashiers, Fannin, Mt. Airy, and Watauga soils. Chandler soils do not have a paralithic contact within 60 inches of the surface. Brownwood soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches below the surface. Cashiers soils have an A horizon with value of 3 that is 7 to 10 inches thick and are very deep to bedrock. Fannin and Watauga soils have argillic horizons. Mt. Airy soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section"
