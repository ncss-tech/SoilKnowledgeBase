  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and Bw horizons and from 0 to 30 percent in the C horizon. Secondary lime concretions and snail shells range from 0 to 20 percent in many pedons. The 2C horizon is variable in content of rock fragments. The soil is slightly or moderately alkaline and effervesces with acid throughout. Redoximorphic depletions, present in some pedons, range from few to common. They occur in the lower part of the dark colored layers in some profiles and only in the lower B or C horizon in others. Matrix colors and mottles with low chromas above 30 inches are not typically due to wetness.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe upper Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. The lower Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 1 through 3. Redoximorphic features having chromas 1 through 4 are in some pedons. The Bw horizon is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 3. The C horizon is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 through 3. The texture ranges from loamy sand to clay in the fine-earth fraction and is stratified in some pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Massanetta soils are on narrow flood plains normally below springs having carbonate-charged water flowing from limestone bedrock. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. The soil formed in alluvial material derived from upland soils. Average annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Berks, Chilhowie, Christian, Edom, Endcav, Frederick, and Timberville soils. None of these soils have secondary lime concretions or mollic epipedons. In addition, the Timberville soils are browner in color. The Berks soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil. The Chilhowie, Edom, Endcav, and Frederick soils have clayey particle size control sections."
