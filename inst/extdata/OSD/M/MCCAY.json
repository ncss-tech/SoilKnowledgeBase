Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has values of 7 or 8 dry and 5 or 6 moist.\nThe 2Bw1 horizon has values of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chromas of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It has 15 to 25 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bw2 horizon has values of hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist.
