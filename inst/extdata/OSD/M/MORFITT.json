Morfitt soils are usually dry but are moist in some parts between depths of 4 to 12 inches for a continuous period equal to more than one quarter of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F., and moist between depths of 4 to 12 inches for at least 60 days out of the 120 days following the winter solstice and are dry for 60 consecutive days or more between 4 and 12 inches within the three month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Depth to lime is 40 to over 60 inches.  The amount of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nA BA horizon is present in some pedons and has color similar to the A horizon. It is loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam clay loam or silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Clay films are few to continuous and faint to distinct.. It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is loam or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent gravel."

Abgese soils have carbonates at 14 to 24 inches and average 15 to 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section.  Ackley soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 53 degrees F. and carbonates at 25 to 50 inches.  Blacknest soils have sand and gravel at 20 to 40 inches.  Bluelight soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Colbar soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.    Eusbio soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Greenbrae soils developed in material from granitic rocks and contain a high percentage of medium and coarser sand.   Hardtrigger soils have carbonates at 10 to 27 inches.  Harsan soils have a duripan of 40 to 60 inches and a mean annual soil temperature of 50 to 54 degrees F.  Hoye soils have carbonates at 10 to 20 inches.  Lankbush soils developed in material from granitic rock and have over 40 percent medium sand or coarser in the particle-size control section.  Nosser soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Shawave soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 53 to 56 degrees F.  Sidlake soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.  Turria soils have carbonates at 30 to 40 inches and a solum that is 12 to 20 inches thick.   Windypoint soils have carbonates at 12 to 18 inches and sand and gravel at 25 to 40 inches.  Hoosegow soils have clay content of 20 to 27 percent clay in the argillic horizon with a clay content of less than 15 percent below the argillic horizon."

These soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from argillites, shales and reworked older terrace sediments.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 8 to 12 inches.  Mean July temperature is about 68 to 72 degrees F.  Mean winter temperature is about 26 to 30 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 51 degrees F.
