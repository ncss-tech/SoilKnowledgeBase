  "OVERVIEW": "The Marblespring series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits. The Marblespring soils are on outwash terrace treads. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",
