Atter soils are very cobbly or very bouldery throughout, have a mean annual soil temperature of 52 to 59 degrees F., and have no lamellae. Carlsborg soils have 50 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days, and do not have lamellae. Spens soils do not have lamellae. Valcreek soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Marblespring soils are on outwash terrace treads. Elevations are 1,535 to 2,400 feet. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits from mixed lithology. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
