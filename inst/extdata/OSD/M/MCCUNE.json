These horizons are coarsely mottled with colors of higher chroma and some with redder hue.  In many places mottles are so coarse and abundant that selection of a dominant color is not feasible. The difference in clay content between the E and Bt horizon is less than 15 percent  Texture and reaction of the C horizon is like that of the B horizon except that some pedons are stratified with thin layers or lenses or more sandy or more clayey texture."
