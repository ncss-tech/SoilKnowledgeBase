  "OVERVIEW": "The McCune series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium of the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  These soils are on low terraces and floodplains and have slope ranging from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
