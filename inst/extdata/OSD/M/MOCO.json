Driest during May and June.  Ustic aridic soil moisture regime.\nSoil Temperature:  62 to 69 degrees F.\nPetronodic feature:  5 to 20 percent petronodes at moderate depths.  Petronodes are thought to have formed from calcium and magnesium the precipitated out during fluctuating seasonal water tables under a climate much wetter than the present.  Repeated wetting and extreme drying of the soils have been a factor in nodule development.  The petronodes have no internal organization and break down completely in HCL acid but not in water.\nRock fragments:  0 to 35 percent hardpan fragments and/or petronodes\nReaction:  slightly to moderately alkaline\nClay content:  18 to 35 percent\nDepth to calcic horizon:  5 to 20 inches\nDepth to gypsic horizon:  20 to 60 inches\nGypsum content:  1 to 20 percent\nA horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist\nChroma:  3 or 4, dry or moist\nCalcium carbonate equivalent:  0 to 5 percent\nBtk and Btky horizons\nHue:  7.5YR, 5YR\nValue:  4 or 5 dry, 3 through 5 moist\nChroma:  4 or 6, dry or moist\nTexture:  sandy clay loam, clay loam, loam\nCalcium carbonate equivalent:  5 to 30 percent\nBky horizon\nHue:  7.5YR, 10YR\nValue:  5 through 8, dry or moist\nChroma:  2 through 4, dry or moist\nTexture:  loam, clay loam, silty clay loam\nCalcium carbonate equivalent:  30 to 55 percent"
