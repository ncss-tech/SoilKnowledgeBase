The typically occur on stream terrace summits and formed in residuum derived from Tertiary sediments (Muddy Creek Formation). Slopes are from 2 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,200 feet. The climate is arid with warm, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 to 7 inches, mean annual temperature is about 66 to 68 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 180 to 300 days."
