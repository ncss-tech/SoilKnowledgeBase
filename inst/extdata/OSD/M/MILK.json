  "OVERVIEW": "The Milk series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from rhyolite with a loess influence.  Milk soils are on hills and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.9 degrees C.",
