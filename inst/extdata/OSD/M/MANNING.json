  "OVERVIEW": "The Manning series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on terraces of streams and outwash channels.  They are 24 to 40 inches deep to sand and gravel.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the substratum.  These soils formed in loamy fluvial sediments overlying sand and gravel.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 42 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

The soil material between depths of 10 inches and the sand and gravel averages between 35 and 50 percent fine sand and coarser and 8 and 18 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  It has up to 3 percent coarse fragments.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam or loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It has 1 to 10 percent coarse fragments.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, gravelly fine sandy loam or loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has 2 to 15 percent coarse fragments and 5 to 20 percent calcium carbonate.  Some pedons have a 2Bk horizon up to 12 inches thick.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sand, loamy sand, coarse sand, sand or loamy coarse sand containing up to 75 percent coarse fragments.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Commonly over 25 percent of the coarse fragments are over 3/4 inch in diameter."

Lehr and Stady soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  McIlwaine soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Ruso and Tally soils are coarse-loamy.  In addition, Ruso soils are pachic and Tally soils do not have sand and gravel 2C horizons within depths of 40 inches.  Vebar soils are moderately deep to soft sandstone bedrock."

Slope gradients typically are less than 5 percent but some are as steep as 15 percent.  These soils formed in 24 to 40 inches of loamy fluvial sediments over sand and gravel.  Mean annual air temperatures range from 34 to 45 degrees F and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 18 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

All of these soils, except Vebar soils, are on nearby terraces, commonly at different levels.  Bowbells and Parshall soils are pachic.  Farland soils are fine-silty.  Straw and Velva soils have an irregular decreases in organic matter with depth.  Vebar soils are on nearby uplands.  Wabek soils are on steep terrace edges and ridges and are sandy-skeletal."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 12 inches (Ap and Bw1 horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 12 to 18 inches (Bw2 horizon).\nThe typifying pedon contains more sand in the 40 to 60 inch layer than is common for the Manning series.  Some soils correlated Manning that have sandy loam or coarse sandy loam textures above the 2C horizon and a 2C horizon at depths of less than 24 inches have been included with the Appam series (sandy, mixed Typic Haploborolls).\nIt is the intent the soil be used in association with residual landforms.  Where the soil has previously been correlated in association with glacial landforms it will be recorrelated to the Ruso series in the future."
