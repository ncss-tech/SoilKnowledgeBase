  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mimentor soils are on fan remnants and inset fans. They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 1375 to 1955 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 255 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
