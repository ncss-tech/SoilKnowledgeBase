  "OVERVIEW": "The Minehart series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic and metamorphic rocks. Minehart soils are on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C. The frost-free season is 180 to 240 days.",
