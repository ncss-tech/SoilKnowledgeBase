  "OVERVIEW": "The Matcher series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till.  Matcher soils are on mountain slopes and glacial moraines and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the umbric epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches, thickness of the solum ranges from 12 to 30 inches, and depth to the sand and gravel substratum ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Organic carbon in the umbric epipedon ranges from .7 to 4 percent.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent by volume in the control section and are dominantly more than 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 through 3.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.  Usually this horizon has fine crumb structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  Dry consistence is soft or slightly hard.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid."

Slope gradients range from 2 to 50 percent.   The soils formed in very stony coarse to moderately coarse textured slightly acid glacial till or outwash.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches with generally uniform precipitation occurring throughout the year.  The mean annual temperature is 34 degrees F. and the frost-free season is 45 to 75 days."
