  "OVERVIEW": "The Matcher series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till.  Matcher soils are on mountain slopes and glacial moraines and have slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",
