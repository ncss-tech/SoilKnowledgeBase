  "OVERVIEW": "The Mountainboy series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils formed in mixed alluvium on outwash fans, fan terraces, and fan remnants. Permeability is moderate.  Mountainboy soils have slopes of 2 to 8 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
