The soils formed in mixed alluvium from sedimentary and metamorphic rock with some loess influence in the surface.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring and cool and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches.  Average summer temperature is 53 to 55 degrees F and average annual temperature is 37 to 39 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
