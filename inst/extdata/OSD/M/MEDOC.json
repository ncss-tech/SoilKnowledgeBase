  "OVERVIEW": "The Medoc series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of silty loess over residuum of the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Medoc soils are on uplands and the slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F.",
