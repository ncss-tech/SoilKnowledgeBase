  "STATES": "NY,PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Morris series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till from red sandstone, siltstone, and shale. They have a dense fragipan layer from 25 to 56 cm (10 to 22 in) that restricts root penetration and water movement. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the fragipan and is low or moderately low in the fragipan and substratum. Mean annual precipitation is about 8 degrees C (46 degrees F) and mean annual temperature is about 1080 mm (42.5 in).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is greater than 102 cm (40 inches). Depth to the fragipan ranges from 25 to 56 cm (10 to 22 inches). Depth to bedrock is 152 cm (60 inches) or more. Rock fragments of angular or rounded sandstone, siltstone or shale range from 10 to 40 percent above the fragipan, and from 15 to 50 percent in the Bx and C horizons. They average less than 35 percent in the control section. Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum, and strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4. In uncultivated areas, the A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have an E horizon with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. The A horizon, when present, can range to 20 cm (8 inches) thick. In wooded areas, some pedons lack an A horizon and have an O horizon above an E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon above 20 inches has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 7, and chroma of 1 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bg or Eg horizons, when present, have colors similar to the Bw, except that the chromas are restricted to 2 or less, and may have high chroma redoximorphic features as well.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Faces of prisms range in hue from 2.5YR through 10YR, or are neutral, value from 5 through 7, and chroma from 0 through 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon. Colors are similar to the Bx horizon. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Morris soils are in till plains and slightly concave uplands. Slopes are dominantly 2 to 15 percent but range from about 0 to 25. The soils formed in firm glacial till derived from reddish sandstone, siltstone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 795 to 1725 mm (31 to 68 inches), but can range as high as 1790mm (70 inches) in higher elevations. Mean annual temperature ranges from 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F), but in some higher elevations it can range as low as 4 degrees C (39 degrees F). The frost-free season ranges from 105 to 180 days. These soils generally occur at elevation between 100 to 670 meters (328 to 2,198 feet) above sea level, but have been mapped as high as 750 meters (2,460 feet) in some areas."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Norwich, Wellsboro, and Lackawanna soils which are in a drainage sequence with Morris soils. Lackawanna soils do not have redoximorphic features above the fragipan. Norwich soils are poorly drained and occur in nearby lower depressions or flat broader areas of the till plain. Arnot, Lordstown, and Oquaga soils are on nearby bedrock controlled landforms. These soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface."
