  "OVERVIEW": "The Murhut series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 100 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 185 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year (perudic).  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 15 to 40 inches thick.  The particle size control section has andic soil properties from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.40 to 0.60 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 and 15-bar water retention of 35 to 50 percent for air-dried samples.  Acid oxalate iron is 2.0 to 3.5 percent.  It has 20 to 40 percent organic matter throughout decreasing with depth.  It has 2 to 6 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.  It is extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, or extremely gravelly medial loam.  Reaction is strongly or very strongly acid."
