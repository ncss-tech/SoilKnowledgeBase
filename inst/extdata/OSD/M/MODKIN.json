  "OVERVIEW": "The Modkin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits.  They are on basalt plains and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
