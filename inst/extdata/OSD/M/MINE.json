  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Although pH of some subhorizons is less than 5.5 (1:1 dilution in water) a major part of the control section between depths of 10 to 20 inches has pH exceeding 5.5 and is more than 60 percent base saturated.  The control section is usually sandy loam or gravelly sand loam but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent, and sand from 50 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent and are mainly 1/2 to 10 inches in diameter.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR are in some pedons but a major part of the control section above a depth of 40 inches has hue of 7.5YR or yellower.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section in some time most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR are in some pedons.  This horizon ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye)."

Baldy soils have a significant component of volcanic ash and have peak periods of precipitation in the late summer and winter months.  Bobtail soils have an albic horizon and a cambic horizon.  Stecum soils are sandy-skeletal."

Slopes typically range from about 2 to 20 percent or more.  The soil formed in thick moderately coarse textured noncalcareous transported material derived principally from gneiss, schist, and quartizite.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 30 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 51 degrees F."
