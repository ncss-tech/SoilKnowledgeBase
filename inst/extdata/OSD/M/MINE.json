  "OVERVIEW": "The Mine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium weathered from gneiss, schist, and quartizite. Mine soils are on outwash plains, alluvial fans, and valley side slopes and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 810 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about -1 degrees C.",
