  "OVERVIEW": "The Marquez series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils.  These very gently to gently sloping soils formed in acid, stratified loamy and clayey Coastal plain sediments, primarily of the Reklaw Formation.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 66 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 39 inches.",
