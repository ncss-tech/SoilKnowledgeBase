    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included with the Kirvin or Rosanky soils.  The series was separated from the Rosanky series based on lower base saturation, and from the Kirvin series because the series province is in the udic moisture regime.\nDiagnostic horizons or features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section:  13 to 33 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 Horizon)\nOchric epipedon:  0 to 13 inches. (A and E horizons)\nAlbic horizon:  7 to 13 inches. (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon:  13 to 42 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and BCt horizons)\nAbrupt textural change:  At the upper boundary of the Bt horizon.\nDepth to Densic Contact:  At the upper boundary of the Cd horizon.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is supported by laboratory data number S82TX-289-025 from Leon County, Texas.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL Data S82TX-289-25 from the type location for the series.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Ninth Edition, 2003\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
