  "OVERVIEW": "The Mountmummy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from limestone and dolomite. Mountmummy soils are on upper back slopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
