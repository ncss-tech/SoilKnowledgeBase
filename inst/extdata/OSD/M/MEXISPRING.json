  "OVERVIEW": "The Mexispring series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks.  Mexispring soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 85 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mexispring soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 85 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from granitic rocks.  The bedrock consists of weathered granite, granodiorite and quartz monzonite which slakes when soaked in water.  Fractures are widely spaced, more than 20 cm, and are less than 2 mm wide.  The weathered bedrock continues below a depth of 60 inches.  Elevations are 4,000 to 6,700 feet.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers with infrequent showers of short duration and cool slightly moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is 40 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is 80 degrees F.  The frost free season is 185 to 235 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 6 inches (A1 and A2 horizons).\nParalithic contact - The boundary at 6 inches to underlying soft, weathered bedrock (Cr layer).\nThe nature of the weathered bedrock should be evaluated to determine whether slaking is typical for the material.  If the material does not slake, it would fit the concept for paralithic materials and not densic materials.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated."
