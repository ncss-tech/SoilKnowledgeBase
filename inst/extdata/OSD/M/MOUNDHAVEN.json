  "OVERVIEW": "The Moundhaven series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils on flood plains.  They formed in sandy alluvium containing thin layers of finer texture.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 39 inches.",
