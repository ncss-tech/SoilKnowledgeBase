  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Yeager series in the same family and the Abscota, Stonelick, and Wirt series.  Yeager soils contain mica flakes but do not contain carbonates. Abscota soils do not have strata finer than loamy fine sand and also carbonates above a depth of 40 inches.  Stonelick and Wirt soils are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moundhaven soils are on natural levees on flood plains in or having their source in areas of Wisconsin aged glaciation.  They formed in calcareous sandy alluvium containing thin strata of finer texture.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 52 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The Moundhaven soils are commonly associated with the Gessie soils on flood plains and Eden and Hennepin soils on adjacent steep upland breaks. Gessie soils are fine-loamy.  Eden soils are fine and formed in limestone and shale residuum.  Hennepin soils are fine- loamy and formed in till."
