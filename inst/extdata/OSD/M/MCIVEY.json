Droem, Leevan, Ravenswood, Roostercomb, Sharesnout, and Tickville soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Netti soils have very cobbly or extremely cobbly argillic horizons. Threek soils have horizons of silica accumulation below argillic horizons and have lithologic discontinuities within 100 cm.  Urwil soils are intermittently moist in some part above the moisture control section between July and September due to summer convection storms.  Wilpar soils are deep to paralithic contacts and are intermittently moist in some part above the moisture control section between July and September due to summer convection storms.  Yago soils have subhorizons of the argillic horizon with identifiable secondary carbonates.  Yeates Hollow soils are deep to lithic contacts."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McIvey soils are on hills and mountains.  These soils formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from quartzite, volcanic and sedimentary rocks.  Typical volcanic rocks are rhyolite, andesite, or tuff and typical sedimentary rocks are shale, sandstone, or conglomerate.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,700 to 2,800 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
