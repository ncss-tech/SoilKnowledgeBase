Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Elevation ranges from 7,200 to 7,700 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
