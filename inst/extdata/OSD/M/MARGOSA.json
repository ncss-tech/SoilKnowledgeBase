  "OVERVIEW": "The Margosa series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone. Margosa soils are on  summits of mesas and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
