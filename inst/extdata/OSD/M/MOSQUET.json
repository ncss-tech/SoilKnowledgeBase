  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mosquet soils are on mountains and plateaus.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as basalt, andesite, and rhyolite with eolian additions of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,580 to 2,900 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The revision of March 2001 updates the taxonomic class from Clayey, smectitic Lithic Ruptic-Argic Cryoborolls. October 2002 revision recovers and re-describes the typical pedon. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to lithic contact is also revised.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 23 cm (Al, A2 and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 36 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 36 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 36 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
