  "OVERVIEW": "The Mosquet series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks with eolian additions of volcanic ash.  Mosquet soils are on mountains and plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

October 2002 revision recovers and re-describes the typical pedon. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and depth to lithic contact is also revised.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 23 cm (Al, A2 and Bt1 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 13 to 36 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 36 cm to underlying hard bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 13 to 36 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
