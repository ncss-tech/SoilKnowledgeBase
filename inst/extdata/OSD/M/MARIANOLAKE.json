  "OVERVIEW": "The Marianolake series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium, fan alluvium and slope alluvium from shale and sandstone. Marianolake soils are on cuesta dipslopes, summits of mesas, drainageways, and fan remnants on valley sides. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
