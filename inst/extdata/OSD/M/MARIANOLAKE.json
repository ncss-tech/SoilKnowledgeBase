    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marianolake soils are on fan remnants on valley sides, summits of mesas, drainageways, and cuesta dipslopes. These soils formed in alluvium, fan alluvium and slope alluvium derived from shale and sandstone of the Menefee formation. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 6,200 to 7,300 feet. The climate is semiarid. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 140 days."
