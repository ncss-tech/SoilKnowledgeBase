Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The 20 to 30 inch thick ash mantle contains 70 to 90 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention of 70 to 90 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water content of 10 to 15 percent on dried samples and 15 to 20 percent on undried samples.  The glacial till material contains 30 to 50 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention of 45 to 70 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water content of 15 to 25 percent on dried samples and 25 to 35 percent on undried samples.  The soil moisture control section is usually moist but is dry in all parts for 30 to 45 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature 43 to 47 degrees F.  The soil is neutral throughout.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR moist, 7.5YR or 10YR dry with value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It has 5 to 15 percent clay (estimated).  It contains 0 to 10 percent subangular gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Total rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe 2Bwb horizon has hue of 5YR moist and 7.5YR dry, value of 3 moist, 4 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  It has 15 to 27 percent clay (estimated).  It contains 0 to 10 percent subrounded gravel, 10 to 20 percent subrounded cobbles and 0 to 5 percent subrounded stones.  Total rock fragments ranges from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe 3Btb horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR moist and dry, value of 3 moist, 4 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  It is cobbly loam or clay loam.

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\nochric epipedon - from the mineral soil surface to 10 inches (A horizon)\ncambic horizon - from 11 to 24 inches (Bw horizon).\nAndic soil properties - the ashy surface mantle (1 to 24 inches) has estimated glass content of 70 to 80 percent (based on data from the Belrick Series), phosphate retention of 74 to 88 percent, acid oxalate aluminum of 0.8 to 1.5 percent and acid oxalate iron of 0.9 to 1.5 percent.\nVitri - the ashy surface mantle (1 to 24 inches) has 15-bar water content of 14 percent on dried samples and 16 to 19 percent on undried samples.\nParticle-size control section - (1 to 41 inches).  The upper part (1 to 24 inches) has 15-bar water content of 14 percent on dried samples but ranges to 10 percent and 16 to 19 percent on undried samples.  The lower part (24 to 41 inches) has 15-bar water content of 15 to 20 percent on dried samples and 25 to 30 percent on undried samples.\nThe A1, A2 and Bw horizons have developed in \"Sand Mountain\" tephra (3,440 years old).  The 2Bwb and 3Btb horizons have developed in \"Abbot Butte\" glacial till (140-170,000 years old).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial laboratory data are available for this soil.  Reference sample S87OR-031-005 from Jefferson County, Oregon, NSSL, Lincoln, NE, 4/89.  The glass counts are assumed to be incorrect based on chemical andic soil properties tests and glass counts on geographically associated soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
