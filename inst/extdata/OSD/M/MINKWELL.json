The upper part (1 to 24 inches) has 15-bar water content of 14 percent on dried samples but ranges to 10 percent and 16 to 19 percent on undried samples.  The lower part (24 to 41 inches) has 15-bar water content of 15 to 20 percent on dried samples and 25 to 30 percent on undried samples.\nThe A1, A2 and Bw horizons have developed in \"Sand Mountain\" tephra (3,440 years old).  The 2Bwb and 3Btb horizons have developed in \"Abbot Butte\" glacial till (140-170,000 years old).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Partial laboratory data are available for this soil.  Reference sample S87OR-031-005 from Jefferson County, Oregon, NSSL, Lincoln, NE, 4/89.  The glass counts are assumed to be incorrect based on chemical andic soil properties tests and glass counts on geographically associated soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
