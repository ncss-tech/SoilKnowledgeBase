  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to gypsum and salt accumulation ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  Depth to shale bedrock typically is 25 to 28 inches, but the range is 20 to 40 inches.  The soil has a Udic soil moisture regime.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Typically it is loam, but the range includes clay loam.  It is medium acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is clay, silty clay or clay loam averaging between 35 and 55 percent clay.  It ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  It has moderate or strong and medium, coarse, or very coarse columnar structure in the upper part.  Where the base of the Bt extends below 16 inches it contains accumu- lations of segregated gypsum or salts.\nSome pedons have a Byz horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay, silty clay or clay loam.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon 6 to 20 inches thick.  It has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay or clay loam.  Typically this horizon contains accumu- lations of segregated lime, gypsum, and salts.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It contains as much as 15 percent shale fragments.\nThe 2Cr or Cr horizon consists of weathered shale bedrock that has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are the Adger, Exline, and Rhoades soils in the same family and the Cathay, Cavour, Cresbard, Larson, Letcher, Miranda, Nahon, Niobell, and Noonan soils.  The Adger, Exline, Miranda, and Rhoades soils do not have shale bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Cathay, Cresbard, and Niobell soils have tonguing of E materials for more than 1 inch into the Bt.  In addition, the Cathay, Miranda and Niobell soils are fine-loamy.  Cavour, Larson, Letcher, Nahon, and Noonan soils do not have salts above a depth of 16 inches.  In addition, the Larson and Noonan soils are fine-loamy and the Letcher soils are coarse-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mekinock soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping side slopes of river and stream valleys on glacial till plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in glacial till and soft shale bedrock or residuum from shale.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 20 inches."

Barnes, Buse, Cathay, Cavour, Cresbard, Edgeley and Larson soils are generally above, Darnen and Svea soils are below, and Exline, Kloten and Miranda soils are on similar landscape positions as the Mekinock soils."
