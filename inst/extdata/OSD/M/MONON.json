Darfur soils are in cooler, drier regions with mean annual temperature less than 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation less than 762 mm (30 inches). Dassel, Lyles, and Toolesboro soils have a C horizon that contains more than 70 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Gilford, Hanska, Uniongrove, and Whitepost soils have carbonates in the lower part of the series control section. Goodell and Overshue soils have a lithologic contact with till in the lower part of the series control section. Jubilee soils are in drier climates that receive less than 76 cm (30 inches) of mean annual precipitation. Mudgepond soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section."

Monon soils formed in loamy and sandy sediments overlying bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 466 meters (600 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

The poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford and Maumee soils are on similar landforms, but do not have limestone bedrock within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). The well drained Ormas and Oshtemo soils are on nearly level to moderately steep higher positions on the landform."
