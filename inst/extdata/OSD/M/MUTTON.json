The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section is 15 to 25 percent clay.  It contains 40 to 60 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate in the less than 2mm fraction and the 15-bar moisture retention is 8 to 12 percent.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has a phosphate retention of 25 to 35 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 20 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe BA horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It contains 30 to 40 percent gravel.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron is 0.15 to 0.35 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mutton soils are on steep to very steep north-facing side slopes of mountains. Elevation ranges from 2200 to 3800 feet.  Slopes are 12 to 80 percent. The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from volcanic tuff with an influence of volcanic ash.   The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Fawnspring soils are fine, montmorillonitic, deep to bedrock, and are on north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Littlefawn soils are fine, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Mowako soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on adjacent south- facing slopes.  Kusu soils are on deep to bedrock and are on north-facing slopes at higher elevations.  Wakamo soils are clayey-skeletal, shallow to bedrock, and are on adjacent ridgetops and gently sloping south-facing slopes."
