Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent and are 1/2 to 3 inch channers.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. Reaction is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR. It is typically clay loam or clay and has 35 to 50 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid through slightly alkaline."

Beaverdam, Blackhorse, Brinkert, Buckskin, Gothic, Heath, Heathcoat, Helmet, Jerry, Sessions,  Trout Creek, and Youman soils are very deep.  Florissant and Owen Creek soils have secondary accumulations of calcium carbonate, in the profile.  Judy, Littlehorn, and Sneffels soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Piltz soils have 15 to 35 percent granitic gravel in the Bt horizon."

These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum weathered from slaty shales. Annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. At the type location the average temperature is 38 degrees F., average summer temperature is 52 degrees F. Elevation is 7,500 to 9,500 feet."
