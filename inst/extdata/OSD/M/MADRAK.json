  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact with sandstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The average annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 44 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice. The particle-size control section has an estimated 0.7 to 2.0 percent acid oxalate extractable Al plus  Fe, 15-bar moisture of 5 to 12 percent, and a moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.10 g/cc.  The upper 7 to 13 inches of the pscs is estimated to have more than 60 percent volcanic glass in the fine earth fraction. The lower part is estimated to have 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value of 3 or 4 dry. Some pedons lack an A horizon.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist. It averages 15 to 25 percent sandstone gravel.\nThe Bw2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist. It averages 15 to 25 percent sandstone gravel and 20 to 30 percent sandstone cobbles.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR and value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist. Texture is very cobbly ashy loamy sand, extremely cobbly ashy loamy sand, or very cobbly ashy sandy loam. It averages 20 to 35 percent sandstone gravel and 25 to 35 percent sandstone cobbles."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Madrak soils are on mountain side slopes and summits.  Slopes are 5 to 45 percent. They formed in colluvium and residuum from swauk sandstone mixed with volcanic ash. Elevations are 5,300 to 6,100 feet. The soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 55 inches. The average January temperature is about 22 degrees F and the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F is 80 to 110 days."
