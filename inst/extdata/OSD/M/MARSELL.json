  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Marsell series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in glacial material weathered from shale and some quartzite and sandstone.  Marsell soils are on ground moraines, lateral moraines and on glacial till and have slopes of 20 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly sandy loam, and has 35 to 60 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is extremely stony sandy loam but ranges to extremely stony or very cobbly loamy sand, very gravelly fine sandy loam or cobbly sandy clay loam in individual layers.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 60 percent by volume in the upper 10 to 24 inches and 50 to 80 percent in the lower part.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent.  This horizon does not have the required clay increase to qualify for an argillic horizon."
