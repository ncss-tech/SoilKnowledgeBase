  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Some pedons have a thin organic layer at the surface. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 27 to 42 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is very gravelly loamy sand, or very gravelly sandy loam, and has 35 to 60 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is extremely stony sandy loam but ranges to extremely stony or very cobbly loamy sand, very gravelly fine sandy loam or cobbly sandy clay loam in individual layers.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 60 percent by volume in the upper 10 to 24 inches and 50 to 80 percent in the lower part.  Base saturation is less than 50 percent.  This horizon does not have the required clay increase to qualify for an argillic horizon."

Slopes are 20 to 60 percent.  These soils formed in material derived from shale, and some quartzite and sandstone.  The mean annual temperature is 35 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 42 inches.  The freeze-free period is 20 to 40 days."
