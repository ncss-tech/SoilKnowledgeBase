    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Goshawk (T), Rondovy (T), and Satus (T) series. Soils with a similar classification and mixed mineralogy are the Gosch (T) and Weste (T) series. Rondovy soils are dominated with rock fragments of glacial till origin from metasedimentary bedrock. Goshawk and Weste soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to andesite or basalt. Gosch soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Satus soils have 5 to 30 percent volcanic glass in the ash mantle and 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in colluvium from basalt or andesite with a mantle of volcanic ash. Elevations are 2,500 to 4,800 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 50 inches. The average January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is about 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 70 to 110 days. The growing season at 28 degrees F. is 145 to 170 days."
