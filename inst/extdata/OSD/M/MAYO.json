Limani soils have organic matter content that does not decrease regularly with depth and they have more than 18 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Pandura soils are shallow to plutonic rocks.  Vivi soils have base saturation of 50 percent or more in the A and B horizons and organic matter decreases erratically with depth.  Yunes soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments and are shallow to volcanic rocks."

The regolith consists of coarse textured sediments derived from overlying plutonic rocks.  The climate is humid tropical.  The average annual precipitation is 75 to 85 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 77 to 80 degrees F."

The Candelero, Coloso, and Maunabo soils have colors of dominantly low chroma.  The Patillas soils have argillic horizons and are shallow to saprolite from plutonic rock.  Teja soils have hard plutonic rock at 10 to 20 inches beneath the soil surface."
