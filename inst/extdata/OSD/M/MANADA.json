An irrigation induced water table at 2 to 3 feet is present during the months of April through October.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  Texture is commonly loam, but the range includes sandy loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is commonly gravelly sandy loam, but the range includes gravelly loam, sandy loam, and fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from a trace to 20 percent gravel.
