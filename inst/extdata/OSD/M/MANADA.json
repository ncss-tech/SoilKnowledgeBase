The particle-size control section is commonly 10 to 15 percent clay with 45 to 65 percent fine or coarser sand, and 10 to 20 percent coarse fragments.  An irrigation induced water table at 2 to 3 feet is present during the months of April through October.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Coarse fragments range from 5 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist.  Texture is commonly loam, but the range includes sandy loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is commonly gravelly sandy loam, but the range includes gravelly loam, sandy loam, and fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from a trace to 20 percent gravel.  The reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
