  "OVERVIEW": "The Modeama series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with moderately slow permeability.  They formed in colluvium from limestone.  These soils are on mountains.  Slope ranges from 5 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
