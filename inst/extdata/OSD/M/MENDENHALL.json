    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature is about 52 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 50 inches thick.  Conductivity ranges from 0 to 16 millimhos in a major part of the control section and there is no subhorizon more than 4 inches thick a depth of above 20 inches that exceeds 15 percent.  The control section is typically sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam but averages 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 40 percent silt, and 45 to 82 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the control section and are mainly 1/4 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of neutral through 3.  It ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline.\nThe B2g horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 moist, and 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of neutral through 2.  It ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in thick calcareous moderately coarse textured alluvial materials derived from sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 12 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degree F. and mean summer temperature is 57 degrees F."
