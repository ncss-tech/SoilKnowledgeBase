  "OVERVIEW": "The Mendenhall series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils with moderately rapid permeability. These soils formed in thick calcareous moderately coarse textured alluvial materials derived from sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rocks and are found on terraces, stream bottoms, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 310 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
