  "OVERVIEW": "The Modesty series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, and glacial outwash plains. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
