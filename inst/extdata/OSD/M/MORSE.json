  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 0 to 15 inches.  Intersecting slickensides range from common to many in the Bkss horizon.  Most areas have prominent gilgai relief with a maximum difference in elevation between the micro swales and micro ridges of about 8 inches.  Pedons are cyclic.  Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 1 inch on the micro ridge tops to 8 inches in the micro swales.  Weighted average clay content in the 10- to 40-inch section is 45 to 60 percent.\nThe A horizon is dark reddish brown (2.5YR 3/4 or 2/4; 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, or 2/2), very dark gray (5YR 3/1 or 10YR 3/1), or dark brown (7.5YR 4/2 or 3/2).  It is clay or silty clay and neutral through moderately alkaline.  Typically, though not diagnostic, the A horizons are calcareous and have calcium carbonate concretions.  Clayey AB horizons are common in the swale part of the cyclic pedons.  They are intermediate between the A and Bkss horizon in colors.\nThe Bkss horizon is red (2.5YR 4/6, 5/6, or 4/8) yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 4/6, or 4/8), or reddish brown (5YR 4/4).  Texture is clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have subhorizons with up to 15 percent calcium carbonate concretions and masses that are 1 to 15 mm in diameter.\nThe 2C horizon, where present is red (2.5YR 4/6, 5/6, or 4/8) yellowish red (5YR 5/6, 4/6, or 4/8), or reddish brown (5YR 4/4).  Texture is very fine sandy loam   It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Burkeville soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section, have smectitic minerology, and are on.Tertiary age uplands   Hannon and Naclina soils have smectitic minerology, and are over shale or stratified loamy and clayey materials and chalk.  Redco soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section, have smectitic minerology, and are more acid in the upper part of the solum.  Ships soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section, and are on flood plains of the Colorado and Brazos Rivers.  Tahoula soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section, have smectitic minerology, and are deep to shale or mudstone."

These soils developed in calcareous clayey alluvial deposits of Pleistocene age.  The climate is humid temperate.  Mean annual temperature near the type location is 65 degrees F. and mean annual precipitaion is 56 inches."
