  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depths to secondary lime is 20 to 40 inches. Depth to basalt is 40 to more than 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is about 48 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between the depth of 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days during summer and fall. The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent angular basalt fragments by volume. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick and includes all or part of the argillic horizon.\nThe A2 horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. It is silt loam, gravelly silt loam or cobbly silt loam.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is silt loam, gravelly silt loam, cobbly silt loam, cobbly loam or very cobbly loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is very gravelly clay loam, very cobbly clay loam, very gravelly loam or very cobbly loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. It is extremely cobbly loam, very cobbly loam, extremely gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, very gravelly clay loam or very cobbly clay loam. The Bk horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

They formed in colluvium and slope alluvium from basalt and loess with some volcanic ash. Elevation ranges from 900 to 3,300 feet. Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches. The average annual air temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F. Frost-free season is 120 to 145 days."
