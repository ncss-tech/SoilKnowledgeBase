These soils developed in dominantly granitic alluvium.  The climate is semiarid continental.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 1/4to 64 1/4F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from l0 to l4 inches.  Precipitation occurs mainly as summer thunderstorms and as gentle winter rains.  The frost-free season is l80 to 230 days."
