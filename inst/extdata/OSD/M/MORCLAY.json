  "OVERVIEW": "The Morclay series consists of very deep to shale, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium over residuum derived from shale. Morclay soils are on valley floors and sides. Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
