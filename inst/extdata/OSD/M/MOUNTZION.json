  "OVERVIEW": "The Mountzion series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from basalt on back slopes and foot slopes of mountains.  Slope is 2 to 65 percent.  Elevation is 600 to 2,200 feet.  The average annual precipitation is about 75 inches, the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F, and the average frost-free season is 130 to 150 days.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 17 inches and an argillic horizon from 17 to 60 inches or more, and does not decrease in clay content within 60 inches.  These soils were correlated as very deep phase of Olyic series in the correlation of the soils of Skamania County, Washington in 1987.  The Olyic series has bedrock within 60 inches of the surface and is Haplohumults.  An amendment to Soil Taxonomy signed in June 1988 made the deep phase of Olyic soils Palehumults.\nThis draft reflects a change in classification only.  CEC activity class has been added to the current classification.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
