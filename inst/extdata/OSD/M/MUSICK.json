  "OVERVIEW": "The Musick series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum from intrusive igneous rocks. Musick soils are on foothills and mountains. Slope ranges from 2 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
