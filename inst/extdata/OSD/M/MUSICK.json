These soils formed in material derived from intrusive igneous rocks such as granite, granodiorite, quartz diorite, or syenite. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 840 to 1800 mm, of which 1 to 15 percent occurs as snow. Mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C, average January air temperature is 3 degrees C, and average July air temperature is 22 degrees C. Frost-free season is 190 to 250 days."

Hotaw soils occur on shoulders and have a paralithic contact with intrusive igneous rock at 50 to 100 cm. Shaver soils have a paralithic contact with intrusive igneous rock at 100 to 150 cm.
