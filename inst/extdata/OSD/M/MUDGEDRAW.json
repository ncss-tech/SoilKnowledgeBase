  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudgedraw series consists of deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in slope alluvium derived from limestone. These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on footslopes of ridges on dissected plateaus. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
