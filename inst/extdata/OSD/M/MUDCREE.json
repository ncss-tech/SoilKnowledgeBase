  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudcree series consists of moderately deep, moderately slowly permeable, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum dominantly from sandstone, siltstone and shale. Mudcree soils are on mountainsides.  Slopes range from 40 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
