    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Melbourne soils are on foothills, hillsides, and ridgetops at elevations of 200 to about 1,200 feet. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The soil formed in colluvium derived from basalt and siltstone over residuum weathered  from siltstone and fine-grained sandstone. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 70 inches. The average January temperature is 38 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. The frost-free season (32 degrees F) ranges between 150 to 200 days. Growing season (28 degrees F) is 165 to 240 days"

Buckpeak and Centralia soils are fine-loamy and are on foothills. Carlton soils are fine-silty and are on lower footslopes, toeslopes, and terraces. Chehalem soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on lower alluvial fans and terraces. Dupee soils have redox depletions and concentrations at depths of 10 to 30 inches and occur in depressions and on footslopes. Galvin and Scamman soils have grayish redox features in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Galvin soils are on old alluvial fans or old stream terraces. Scamman soils are on high terraces and footslopes. Goodin soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and occur on convex positions on side slopes. Lacamas soils have an aquic moisture regime and are on glacial terraces and footslopes. Olympic and Salkum soils have a base saturation of less than 35 percent at a depth of 1.25 meters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon. Olympic soils are on foothills. Saulkum soils are on old terrace remnants and hills. Vader soils have a cambic horizon and are on foothills."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface to 8 inches\nArgillic horizon - from 8 to 77 inches that has coarse redox depletions and concentrations in the lower part.\nPale feature - the zone from 8 to 77 inches having no clay decrease of 20 percent.\nAdditional investigation is needed as to determine whether the depletions and mottled description used in the BCt horizon are related to parent material or to saturated redox conditions.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data from the state of Washington includes soil sample numbers S72WA-21-4, S72WA-21-5, and S72WA-21-11. Laboratory data for 2 pedons support the classification., The third pedon 21-4 has a base saturation (by sum) of less than 35 percent in the lower part of the argillic horizon and is considered a Taxadjunct to the series. Characterization data from the state of Oregon include User Pedon ID # 01OR071015 and 04OR071010.  Pedon ID # 04OR071010 has a base saturation (by sum) of less than 35 percent in the lower part of the argillic horizon and is also considered a Taxadjunct to the series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
