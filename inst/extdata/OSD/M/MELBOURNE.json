Buckpeak and Centralia soils are fine-loamy and are on foothills. Carlton soils are fine-silty and are on lower footslopes, toeslopes, and terraces. Chehalem soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on lower alluvial fans and terraces. Dupee soils have redox depletions and concentrations at depths of 10 to 30 inches and occur in depressions and on footslopes. Galvin and Scamman soils have grayish redox features in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Galvin soils are on old alluvial fans or old stream terraces. Scamman soils are on high terraces and footslopes. Goodin soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and occur on convex positions on side slopes. Lacamas soils have an aquic moisture regime and are on glacial terraces and footslopes. Olympic and Salkum soils have a base saturation of less than 35 percent at a depth of 1.25 meters below the upper boundary of the argillic horizon. Olympic soils are on foothills. Saulkum soils are on old terrace remnants and hills. Vader soils have a cambic horizon and are on foothills."
