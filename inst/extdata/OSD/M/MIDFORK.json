Coarse fragments range from 35 to 65 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  It is mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 14 percent."

Antrobus soils formed in material from basalt and have many dark colored mineral grains in the sand and silt fraction.  Broad Canyon, Foxmount, Grafen, Handran, Kamack, McCort, Maurice, Sebud, and Supervisor soils are noncalcareous.  Fairydell soils have a horizon of silicate accumulation.  Farlow soils have more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Greyback soils grade to sandy-skeletal material in the lower part.  Midelight soils have a very channery loam control section.  Parachute soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Teemat soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Tiban soils have a C2 horizon with hue of 2.5YR.  Tineman soils have a horizon of gravelly sand or loamy sand in the lower part of the control section."
