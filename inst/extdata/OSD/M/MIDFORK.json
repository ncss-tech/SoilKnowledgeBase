  "OVERVIEW": "The Midfork series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in stream and slope alluvium.  Midfork soils are on fan aprons and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 32 degrees F.",

Antrobus soils formed in material from basalt and have many dark colored mineral grains in the sand and silt fraction.  Broad Canyon, Foxmount, Grafen, Handran, Kamack, McCort, Maurice, Sebud, and Supervisor soils are noncalcareous.  Fairydell soils have a horizon of silicate accumulation.  Farlow soils have more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Greyback soils grade to sandy-skeletal material in the lower part.  Midelight soils have a very channery loam control section.  Parachute soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Teemat soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Tiban soils have a C2 horizon with hue of 2.5YR.  Tineman soils have a horizon of gravelly sand or loamy sand in the lower part of the control section."
