  "OVERVIEW": "The Murken series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and eolian deposits from extrusive igneous rock.  Murken soils are on lava plateau escarpments. Slopes range from 15 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from mid March to late November (260 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F from mid May to early November.  The soil moisture control section (11 to 34 inches) is dry in all parts from about early July to early November (110 to 130 days) and is moist in all parts from December to May. The particle size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, mostly stones and boulders.  Rock fragments, mostly stones or cobbles on the soil surface, range from 35 to 60 percent.  NaF pH is 8.0 to 8.5 and decreases with depth.  Base saturation by Hach Kit ranges from 75 to 90 percent and increases with depth.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent throughout and decreases regularly with depth.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral and increases with depth.\nThe A horizon moist color is 7.5YR 3/2 or 5YR 3/2.  Rock fragments, mostly stones or gravel, range from 35 to 60 percent.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 25 percent.\nThe Bt horizon color is 7.5YR 4/4 or 5/4."
