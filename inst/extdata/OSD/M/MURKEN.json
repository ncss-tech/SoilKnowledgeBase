    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.   Mollic epipedon thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from mid March to late November (260 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F from mid May to early November.  The soil moisture control section (11 to 34 inches) is dry in all parts from about early July to early November (110 to 130 days) and is moist in all parts from December to May. The particle size control section averages 18 to 25 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, mostly stones and boulders.  Rock fragments, mostly stones or cobbles on the soil surface, range from 35 to 60 percent.  NaF pH is 8.0 to 8.5 and decreases with depth.  Base saturation by Hach Kit ranges from 75 to 90 percent and increases with depth.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent throughout and decreases regularly with depth.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral and increases with depth.\nThe A horizon moist color is 7.5YR 3/2 or 5YR 3/2.  Rock fragments, mostly stones or gravel, range from 35 to 60 percent.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 25 percent.\nThe Bt horizon color is 7.5YR 4/4 or 5/4."

These soils formed in colluvium and eolian deposits weathered from extrusive igneous rock.  Elevation is 3500 to 4000 feet.  The climate is semiarid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches.  Snowfall is 24 to 36 inches.  The mean annual temperatures is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The mean January temperature is about 32 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
