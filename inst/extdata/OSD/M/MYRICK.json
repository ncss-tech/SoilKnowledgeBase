    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth of the solum and thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  The depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Myrick soils are calcareous throughout and mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, and less commonly clay with an average clay content of 35 to 50 percent.\nThe Bg horizon, when present below the mollic epipedon, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with an average clay content of 35 to 50 percent.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is stratified very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Thin strata of coarser or finer textured material are common."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Levasy series in the same family and the Blake, Gilliam, Grable, Leta, Onawa, Parkville, Percival, and Waldron series.  Levasy soils are formed in thicker clayey deposits.  Blake, Grable, Onawa, and Percival soils lack mollic epipedons and Onawa soils generally are formed in thicker clayey deposits.  Gilliam soils lack an abrupt textural change.  Leta soils have greater than 20 inches of clayey textures in the upper part of the solum.  Parkville soils are not saturated with water during the growing season and generally have higher chroma in the loamy deposits.  Waldron soils are clayey throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Myrick soils are in depressions on recent flood plains of major streams.  The slope gradient is 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in clayey sediment 12 to 20 inches thick over loamy textured sediments.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches."

Gilliam and Haynie soils formed in loamy alluvium and occur on higher adjacent bottom lands.  Kenmoor, Modale, and Waubonsie soils formed in loamy alluvium over clayey alluvium and occur on slightly higher adjacent bottom lands.  Leta soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of clayey alluvium and occur on slightly higher adjacent bottom lands.  Parkville soils are not as wet and occur on slightly higher adjacent bottom lands.  Sarpy soils formed in sandy alluvium and occur next to major streams.  Waldron soils formed in thick clayey deposits and occur on higher adjacent bottom lands."
