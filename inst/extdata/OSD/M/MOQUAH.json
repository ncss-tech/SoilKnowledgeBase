  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil typically is very strongly acid to mildly alkaline.  Color, arrangement, and thickness of horizons vary considerably because of the nature of the parent materials.\nThe A horizon has 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR hue; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is typically fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but the range includes loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon typically has 2.5YR or 5YR hue but includes individual horizons of 7.5YR or 10YR hue, value is 3 to 5, and chroma is 3 to 6.  Textures within the control section are variable in their order of occurrence but commonly are fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, and silt loam.  Thin individual horizons of sand, fine sand, very fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand occur but the control section averages between 8 and 18 percent clay.  In some pedons, below a depth of 40 inches, horizons of silty clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, loamy sand, or sand occur along with the textures listed in the control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moquah soils are on narrow flood plains of the major streams.  The topography is nearly level or gently undulating with slope gradients from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 28 to 35 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F."
