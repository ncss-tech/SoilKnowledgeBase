  "OVERVIEW": "The Maggie series consists of shallow over indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks. They are on pediments and hills. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
