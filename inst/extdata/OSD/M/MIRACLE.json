    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches, thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches and depth to the underlying bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are usually noncalcareous throughout but are weakly and discontinuously calcareous immediately above the bedrock in a few pedons.  Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .8 to 2 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.  The soil is 80 to 100 percent base saturated.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is commonly less than 1 throughout the entire solum but is slightly higher immediately above the bedrock in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are usually less than 10 percent in the particle-size control section.  Typically, the solum rests directly upon the underlying bedrock.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 33 to 46 degrees F. and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 to 59 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (pH 6.8 to 7.8).  Typically, the horizon has fine granular or crumb structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons. It is soft or slightly hard.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is typically sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent and sand from 45 to 70 percent, with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline (pH 6.8 to 7.8)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients range from 2 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in material weathered from the underlying reddish brown calcareous sandstone.  Average annual precipitation is 16 to 25 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring during the spring and early summer.  Average annual temperature is 37 to 40 degrees F., and average summer temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F.  Elevation is 7,500 to 8,500 feet and the frost-free period is 50 to 75 days."
