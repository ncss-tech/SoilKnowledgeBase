  "OVERVIEW": "The Milby series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy and loamy alluvial sediments of Pleistocene age. These gently sloping soils are on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1194 mm (47 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
