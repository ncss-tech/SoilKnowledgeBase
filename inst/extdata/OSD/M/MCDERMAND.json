  "OVERVIEW": "The McDermand series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and till over residuum weathered from granite. The McDermand soils are in cirques and mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1075 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
