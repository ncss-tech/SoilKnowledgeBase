  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum and depth to lithic contact bedrock are about 10 to 20 inches. There are up to 35 percent shale fragments throughout the soil. The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 64 degrees F. and soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. from February 10 to January 1. The soils are moist between depths of 4 and 12 inches in some or all parts between November and May. The soil is dry the rest of the year. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline and in most pedons there is not much change from top to bottom. Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam and may have up to 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 7/4, 7/3, 6/3, 6/2, 6/4, 5/3, 5/4, 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, 4/3; 2.5Y 5/2 or 5/4. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 3/4, 3/3, 5/4 or 7.5YR 3/4. Some pedons have thin surfaces with color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3. Moist values are 4 or more or the epipedon is too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon. Organic matter content is about 1 to 3 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has color of 10YR, 2.5Y and or 7.5YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 4/6, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/3, or 6/4. Some pedons are 10YR 7/4 and moist color commonly of 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/4 or 6/4 in same hues and 5YR 4/4 and 3/4 moist. This horizon has about 18 to 30 percent clay but the increase from the A horizon to the Bt horizon is not sufficient to qualify the B horizon as an argillic horizon. A few thin clay films are present in most pedons. The Bt horizon has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure or weak angular blocky structure."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Auburn, Toomes and Witherell series. Auburn soils (MLRA 15, 18), on foothills, are formed in material weathered from metabasic or metasedimentary rock, have color hue of 5YR and 7.5YR. Toomes soils (MLRA 15, 18), on ridges and plateaus of volcanic flows and on foothills of volcanic uplands, formed in material weathered from tuff breccia, basalt and andesite and contain some vitreous material. Witherell soils (MLRA 15), on hills and mountains, have mean annual precipitation of 35 to 70 inches with occasional snow above 3,000 feet and have a moisture control section that is dry in all parts for less than 140 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Millsholm soils are on mountains. Elevation is 180 to 4,570 feet. Slope is 5 to 75 percent. These soils formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale. The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 50 inches. Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 63 degrees F; mean January temperature is about 43 degrees F; and mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F. The frost-free season is about 130 to 330 days."

Altamont soils, on uplands, are deep and have a fine particle-size control section. Contra Costa soils, on foothills and mountains, have an argillic horizon. Gaviota soils, on hills and mountains, do not have a cambic horizon. Gazos soils, on hills, have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Lodo soils, on uplands, do not have a cambic horizon. Los Osos soils, on mountains, are moderately deep and have an argillic horizon. Millsap soils, on foothill toe slopes, have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and have a fine particle-size control section. Sehorn soils, on foothills, have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
