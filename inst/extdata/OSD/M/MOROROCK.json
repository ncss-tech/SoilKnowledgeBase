  "OVERVIEW": "The Mororock series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium  and residuum derived from granitic and metasedimentary rocks. The Mororock soils are on mountain slopes and canyon walls of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 895 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
