  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudbuz soils consist of very deep, well drained soils on mountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from interbedded sandstone and shale. Slopes are 10 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 810 mm, and mean annual air temperature is 2 degrees C.",
