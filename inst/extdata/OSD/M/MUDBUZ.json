The mollic epipedon is 4\nto 9 inches thick.  Depth to the base of the argillic\nhorizon is 25 to 44 inches.  Rock fragments range from 35 to\n50 percent in the particle-size control section.  The\nmoisture control section is usually moist, when the soil\ntemperature is greater than 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry,\n2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is\nneutral or slightly acid.\nIn the Bt horizon, texture is very cobbly to extremely stony\nclay loam or clay.  Clay content is 35 to 50 percent.  Hue\nis 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, with\nchroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is neutral to slightly acid.\nIn the C horizon, hue is 10YR through 5YR, value is 6 or 7\ndry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Reaction is\nmoderately acid through neutral."

The Cluff and Winz series have an E horizon or\na B/E horizon and are deeper to the base of the Bt horizon. Cochedome soils have lithic bedrock above 40 inches.  The\nReck and Recklor series are dry in some part of the\nmoisture control section for some time in most years when\nthe temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.\nThe Yence soils have warmer mean annual soil temperatures\nthat range from 41 to 43 degrees F."
