  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudbuz soils consist of very deep, well drained soils on\nmountain side slopes.  These soils formed in residuum and\ncolluvium derived from interbedded sandstone and shale.\nSlope is 10 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is\nabout 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is 36 degrees F.",
