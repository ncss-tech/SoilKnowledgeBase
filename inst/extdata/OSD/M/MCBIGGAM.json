  "OVERVIEW": "The McBiggam series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in loess overlying material weathered from basalt.  McBiggam soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  Permeability is slow.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
