Clay content in the upper 51 cm (20 in) of the Bt horizon typically contains 25 to 30 percent clay and ranges from 20 to 35. To a depth of 123 cm (48 in) or more, the soil contains less than 5 percent sand.\nRedoximorphic features:  Black coats and stains on faces of peds in the Bt horizon range from few to many.  Gray or pale brown silt coatings in cracks or on faces of peds range from none to common."
