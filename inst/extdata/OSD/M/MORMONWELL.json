  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mormonwell soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Elevations are 1,570 to 2,500 meters (5,150 to 8,200). The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Great Basin. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 millimeters; mean annual air temperature is 6 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 90 to 135 days."
