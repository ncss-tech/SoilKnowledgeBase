  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. RWF-DKP",
  "REVDATE": "09/2001",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Moniteau series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches.",

Blackoar, Nodaway, Piopolis, and Westerville soils do not have an argillic horizon, are stratified, and are on lower flood plains."
