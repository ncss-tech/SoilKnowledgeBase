Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Btg horizon and Cg horizon, where present, have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron masses have hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Moniteau soils are on flood plains and formed in alluvium. Slope commonly ranges from 0 to 3 percent, but may range to 5\npercent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the moderately well drained Nodaway, the somewhat poorly drained Auxvasse and Westerville soils, and the poorly drained Blackoar and Pioplis soils. Auxvasse soils have an abrupt textural change between the E and B horizons and are in similar positions. Blackoar, Nodaway, Piopolis, and Westerville soils do not have an argillic horizon, are stratified, and are on lower flood plains."
