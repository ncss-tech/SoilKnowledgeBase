  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone bedrock range from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to the Bh horizon is 12 to 30 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid in the A and E horizons, very strongly acid to neutral in the Bh horizon, very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the BE and Eg horizons, and moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the Btg horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe EB or BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 , and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown or yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is composed of soft, weathered, fractured limestone that can be dug with difficulty with a spade, has very firm to extremely firm rupture resistance with low to high excavation difficulty.  It usually contains soft carbonate accumulations along with few to many hard limestone or chert fragments.  It is highly irregular and interspersed with solution holes that range from 4 to 12 inches in diameter and filled with sandy loam to sandy clay textured soil material.  Depth to limestone is very variable within short distances.\nThe 2R horizon is composed of hard, unweathered limestone that has slightly rigid to very rigid rupture resistance with very high to extremely excavation difficulty.  Some areas contain solution holes filled with Btg and/or Cr material."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Echaw, Hurricane, Mandarin, Ridgeland, and Rigdon series.  Echaw soils do not have an argillic horizon and depth to the spodic horizon is 30 to 50 inches.  Hurricane soils do not have an argillic horizon [Band depth to the spodic horizon is below 50 inches].  Mandarin soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Ridgeland soils do not have an E horizon above the spodic horizon.  Rigdon soils are extremely acid to strongly acid throughout and are not underlain by limestone."

Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches, and the average annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F."

Chaires and Meadowbrook soils have higher seasonal high water tables and are on lower positions and depressional areas.  Harbeson, Lutterloh, Moriah, and Ridgewood soils do not have spodic horizons.  In addition, Harbeson soils are in depressions and drainageways and Moriah soils are underlain by limestone at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."
