Where McGinn soils are in dissected landscapes, they occupy mid to upper convex slopes. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C (43 to 47 degrees F)."

They depart from the concept of Emmet soils by having a glossic horizon and by being more acid in the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record No.: MI0053.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
