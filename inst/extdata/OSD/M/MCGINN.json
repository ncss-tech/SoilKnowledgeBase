  "OVERVIEW": "The McGinn series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy deposits and in loamy till on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).",

They depart from the concept of Emmet soils by having a glossic horizon and by being more acid in the argillic horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record No.: MI0053.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
