Aquic conditions: Endosaturation 46 to 107 centimeters (18 to 42 inches)\nThese soils were formerly mapped as made land or Arents.\nThe water table will vary with the amount of fill material and artificial drainage within any mapped area. However, in most years it is at depths of 24 to 36 inches below the surface of the fill for 2 to 4 months.  It is at depths below 60 inches during extended dry periods.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
