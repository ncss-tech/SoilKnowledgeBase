    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Appleseed (AZ), Goldroad (AZ, NV, CA), Hyder (AZ), Quilotosa (AZ), Redneedle (NV) and Sunrock (AZ, CA, NV) series. None of these soils require a rock C horizon above the A horizon. In addition, Appleseed soils have a calcium carbonate equivalence of 15 to 35 percent and form in limestone parent material over limestone bedrock. Goldroad soils formed in granitoid parent material and are dominated by 2 to 5 millimeter gravel in the particle-size control section. Hyder and Quilotosa soils have intermittent soil moisture in the moisture control section for 20 days or more, cumulative, from July through September, typical of the Sonoran desert. Redneedle soils formed in residuum and colluvium from calcareous sandstone conglomerate and Sunrock soils have particle-size control sections dominated by fine and medium sands."

Elevations range from 300 to 670 meters (985 to 2,195 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches); mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F), and the frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."
