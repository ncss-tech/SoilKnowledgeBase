  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Masonic soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from andesite, andesitic tuff and tuff breccias with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,015 to 2,440 meters.  The climate is continental with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 70 days."
