  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the weakly cemented horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Pebbles and cobbles on the surface range from 35 to 80 percent.  These soils are usually dry between early October and late May.  The upper part is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline, and is strongly calcareous or very strongly calcareous.\nThe A and Bt horizons have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  In the lower part the Bt has chroma of 2 to 4.  The B2t horizon ranges from sandy clay loam to heavy loam or clay loam and averages less than 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Individual horizons have sandy clay texture.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 6 through 8 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma 1 through 4.  Its fine earth fraction ranges from sandy clay loam to loam or clay loam.  Lime content of the fine earth material in the Bk horizons ranges from about 15 to 25 percent.  Cementation ranges from weak to strong in the Bk2 horizon.  Cindery material ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the lower part of the Bk1 and Bk2 horizon.  Rock fragments range from 25 to 70 percent below 40 inches and are stones, cobbles, and gravel."

Mokiak and Salas soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Montoso soils have more than 10 percent cinders and lack cementation.  Murdo soils have gravelly sand and sand and gravel in the lower part.  Willowman soils lack weak to strong cementation in the calcic horizon."

The soils formed in medium to moderately fine material weathered mainly from basalt, with some eolian influence and with a small amount of cinders.  Annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 55 degrees F.  The precipitation pattern has a marked summer maximum.  The frost-free period is 115 to 180 days."
