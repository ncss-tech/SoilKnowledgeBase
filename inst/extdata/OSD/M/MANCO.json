Most pedons have few to many iron accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, or red.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon less than 6 inches thick, with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.   Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6, with few to many iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown, or red, and iron depletions in shades of gray.  Some pedons are variegated in these colors.  Most pedons have thin discontinuous bedding planes.

Mathiston and Mantachie soils are not dry in some part of the moisture control section for 60 cumulative days in most years.  In addition, Mantachie soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section.  Pophers soils have electrical conductivity of more than 4 mmhos/cm in the lower part of the control section.  Socagee soils have dominant chroma of 1.  Dreka and Mattex soils have a clayey layer between a depth of 40 and 60 inches.  In addition, Dreka soils have a nonacid reaction class.  Also, Mattex soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section.  Iulus soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section."
