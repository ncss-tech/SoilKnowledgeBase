  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 80 inches thick.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid throughout.  Weighted average clay content of the control section ranges from 20 to 34 percent and sand coarser than very fine sand ranges from to 2 to 15 percent.  Organic carbon content ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 percent at a depth of 50 inches.  These soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for more than 60 cumulative days in most years.  Some pedons have buried A horizons in or below the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Most pedons have few to many iron accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, or red.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon less than 6 inches thick, with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.   Texture is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6, with few to many iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown, or red, and iron depletions in shades of gray.  Some pedons are variegated in these colors.  Most pedons have thin discontinuous bedding planes.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, with few to many iron accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, or red.  Some pedons have thin discontinuous bedding planes.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Mathiston and Pophers series of the same family.  Other similar soils are the Dreka, Iulus, Mantachie, Mattex, and Socagee series.  Mathiston and Mantachie soils are not dry in some part of the moisture control section for 60 cumulative days in most years.  In addition, Mantachie soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section.  Pophers soils have electrical conductivity of more than 4 mmhos/cm in the lower part of the control section.  Socagee soils have dominant chroma of 1.  Dreka and Mattex soils have a clayey layer between a depth of 40 and 60 inches.  In addition, Dreka soils have a nonacid reaction class.  Also, Mattex soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section.  Iulus soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section."

An apparent water table is at 1.0 to 1.5 feet for 1 to 3 cumulative months mainly during the winter and spring seasons.  These soils flood frequently unless protected.  Typically, they flood 2 to 5 times during most years.  Duration of flooding is long."

Native grasses include longleaf uniola, Florida paspalum, Virginia wildrye, and various panicums.  Improved pastures consists of bahiagrass, common bermudagrass, and tall fescuegrass.  Pastures are typically overseeded with white clover."
