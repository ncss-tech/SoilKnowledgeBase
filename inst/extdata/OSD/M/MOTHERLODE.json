  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Motherlode soils are on hills, usually in backslope and footslope hillslope positions. Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metavolcanic rocks, mainly greenstone. Elevation is 80 to 800 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 405 to 875 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 14 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 215 to 335 days."
