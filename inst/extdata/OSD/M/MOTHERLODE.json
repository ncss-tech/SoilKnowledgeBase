  "OVERVIEW": "The Motherlode series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metavolcanic rocks, mainly greenstone and greenschist. Motherlode soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 755 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
