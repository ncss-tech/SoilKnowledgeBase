  "OVERVIEW": "The Mississinewa series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are shallow to dense till. Mississinewa soils formed in till and are on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",
