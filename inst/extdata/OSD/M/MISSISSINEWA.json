Cardington, Ellsworth, Geeburg, Glynwood, Mortimer, Pert, Shinrock, and Wyatt series are in closely related families but are not shallow to a root-limiting layer. Cardington, Ellsworth, Geeburg, Mortimer, Shinrock, and Wyatt soils are more than 50 cm (20 inches) to the base of argillic horizon. Glynwood soils are deeper than 50 cm (20 inches) to a densic contact. Pert soils have moist bulk density of less than 1.70 g/cc in the lower part of the series control section."

The soils formed in clay loam or silty clay loam till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1092 mm (36 to 43 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 12.2 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 335 meters (600 to 1100 feet) above mean sea level."

Potential for surface water runoff is medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately high to low in the underlying dense till. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till."
