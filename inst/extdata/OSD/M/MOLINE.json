Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 50 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 45 to 60 percent clay.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 0 to 2.  They are silty clay or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2B and 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is clay or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.  Strata of silt, silt loam and silty clay loam may be present in some pedons.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, and has redoximorphic features.  Redoximorphic features have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 8.  The 3C horizon is dominantly silt loam or silty clay loam, but includes strata of finer or coarser textures in some pedons below a depth of 50 inches.  Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  The 3C horizon may not be present in some pedons."

Carlow soils are more acid in the series control section.  Chequest soils average 35 to 42 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Cove soils do not have carbonates within 60 inches.  Fults soils do not have carbonates within 60 inches.  Kalona soils average 30 to 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Kings soils formed in stratified calcareous clay and silty clay lacustrine sediments and do not have a lithologic discontinuity.  Rosedell (T) soils have less than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Streator soils average 35 to 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Titus soils average 35 to 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Woodbury soils formed in clayey alluvium and do not have a lithologic discontinuity."

Taxonomic version - Second edition, 1999.\nThese soils were formerly mapped as a taxadjunct of the Montgomery series in Rock Island County, IL, and included with the Booker series in Henry County, IL. They are primarily situated on a low first terrace of the Rock River valley between these two counties, and to a lesser extent along the Mississippi River in the former county.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
