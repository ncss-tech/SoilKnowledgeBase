The particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 10 to 18 percent clay.  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It has 20 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam, very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly loam.  It has 20 to 45 percent gravel and 10 to 35 percent cobbles."
