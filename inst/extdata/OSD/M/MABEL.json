Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A, E, and uppermost Bt horizons and from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the other Bt, Btk, and C horizons. Boulders occur randomly at or near the surface and within the upper pedon at intervals of about 20 to 80 feet and cover 0.01 to 1.0 percent of the soil surface.  None to common gravel and cobble-size chert fragments are throughout the pedon.  Limestone substratum phases have none to few boulders, and are underlain by limestone at depths of 40 to 72 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 with mottles in shades of yellow and brown, or pockets and streaks are in some pedons that have similar color to that of the A horizon.  Texture is sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 3 to 8 with mottles in shades of yellow, brown, and red.  Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon and the Btk horizon have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6 with mottles in shades of gray, yellow, red and brown.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Where present, the Btg has similar properties except chroma is 2 or less.  The control section has 35 to 60 percent clay, with less than 30 percent silt.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 with mottles in shades of yellow and red.  It is clay loam, clay or sandy clay loam.  It has common calcium carbonate nodules 1 to 3 centimeters in size and common limestone cobbles.\nThe 2Cr horizon, where present, is soft limestone that contains hard limestone and chert boulders in some pedons.  The 2R horizon, where present, can usually be excavated with power equipment."
