  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 51 to 102 cm. Depth to carbonates ranges from 51 to 178 cm. Gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum and 0 to 10 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the subsoil, and neutral to moderately alkaline in the substratum. Some pedons have carbonates below a depth of 178 cm.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Redoximorphic features are present. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon with colors similar to that of the Bt and E horizons. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR toto 2.5Y, value of 4 toto 6, and chroma of 2 toto 4. Redoximorphic features are present. Texture of the fine earth-fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with a range of 35 to 60 percent clay. Structure is weak to strong prismatic, or it is or parts to subangular or angular blocky.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or silt loam, and it is commonly varved in the lower part with silt and very fine sand. Some pedons have vertical desiccation cracks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Muskellunge soils are on marine or lacustrine plains or are in upland basins. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. They formed in marine or glaciolacustrine deposits high in clay. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C; and mean annual precipitation ranges from 790 to 1490 mm; The frost-free period ranges from 100 to 160 days. The elevation ranges from 30 to 340 meters above sea level."

The moderately well drained Heuvelton and the poorly and very poorly drained Adjidaumo soils are in a drainage sequence with Muskellunge soils. Matoon and the poorly drained Guff soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Dalbo soils are similar to the Muskellunge soils but are better drained. Insula, Millsite, Quetico, and Ruse soils are on bedrock controlled, glacial till landscapes. Millsite soils are moderately deep and are well drained and somewhat excessively drained. Insula and Ruse soils are shallow. Insula soils are well drained and Ruse soils are somewhat excessively drained."
