  "OVERVIEW": "The Muskellunge series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in fine sediments deposited in marine and lacustrine environments. They are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on marine and lacustrine plains and in basins on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual air temperature is 7 degrees C. and mean annual precipitation is 1000 mm.",

Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the subsoil, and neutral to moderately alkaline in the substratum. Some pedons have carbonates below a depth of 178 cm.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 3. Redoximorphic features are present. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon with colors similar to that of the Bt and E horizons. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR toto 2.5Y, value of 4 toto 6, and chroma of 2 toto 4. Redoximorphic features are present. Texture of the fine earth-fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay with a range of 35 to 60 percent clay. Structure is weak to strong prismatic, or it is or parts to subangular or angular blocky.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay, or silt loam, and it is commonly varved in the lower part with silt and very fine sand.

The moderately well drained Heuvelton and the poorly and very poorly drained Adjidaumo soils are in a drainage sequence with Muskellunge soils. Matoon and the poorly drained Guff soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Dalbo soils are similar to the Muskellunge soils but are better drained. Insula, Millsite, Quetico, and Ruse soils are on bedrock controlled, glacial till landscapes. Millsite soils are moderately deep and are well drained and somewhat excessively drained. Insula and Ruse soils are shallow. Insula soils are well drained and Ruse soils are somewhat excessively drained."
