  "OVERVIEW": "The Mellowmoon series consists of very deep, well drained soils on benches and foot slopes.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from a variety of extrusive igneous rocks.   Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
