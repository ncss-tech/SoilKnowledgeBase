  "OVERVIEW": "The Macareeno series consists of very deep, somewhat drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from mixed rock. These soils are on hillsides and have slopes of 8 to 15 percent. The mean annual temperature about 41 42 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches.",
