  "OVERVIEW": "The Mortenson series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in colluvium from sandstone on mountainsides.  Slopes are 20 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

Similar soils are the Baird Hollow, Callings, Cluff, Duchesne, Fitzgerald, Loberg, Nutras, Sunshine, Tenrag, Vulcan, Worock and Yourame series.  Baird Hollow, Callings and Sunshine soils have mollic epipedons.  Cluff, Fitzgerald, and Duchesne soils have dark A horizons 6 to 9 inches thick.  Cluff, Callings, Sunshine, Loberg, Nutras and Vulcan soils have the upper boundary of the Bt horizon at depths of less than 24 inches.  Duchesne, Tenrag, Worock, and Yourame soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections."
