Similar soils are the Baird Hollow, Callings, Cluff, Duchesne, Fitzgerald, Loberg, Nutras, Sunshine, Tenrag, Vulcan, Worock and Yourame series.  Baird Hollow, Callings and Sunshine soils have mollic epipedons.  Cluff, Fitzgerald, and Duchesne soils have dark A horizons 6 to 9 inches thick.  Cluff, Callings, Sunshine, Loberg, Nutras and Vulcan soils have the upper boundary of the Bt horizon at depths of less than 24 inches.  Duchesne, Tenrag, Worock, and Yourame soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections."

These soils formed in colluvium from sandstone.  The climate is moist subhumid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 53 to 58 degrees F. and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 80 days."
