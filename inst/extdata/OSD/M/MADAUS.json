  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Similar soils in related families are the Aurelius, Edwards, Kjar, Martisco, Rondeau, and Warners series. Aurelius soils have loamy substratum layers within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Edwards and Rondeau soils have more than 41 cm (16 inches) of muck over marly material. Kjar soils are moderately or strongly saline within the series control section. Martisco soils do not have a sandy particle-size class within the particle-size control section. Warners soils have a mollic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Madaus soils are in marshy depressions on outwash plains, lake plains, lake terraces, flood plains, moraines, and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Madaus soils formed in herbaceous organic materials overlying marly material and sand deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1067 mm (28 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 11.1 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

These very poorly drained soils are on similar landform positions as Madaus soils. Adrian and Antung soils formed in herbaceous organic material over sandy deposits. Edselton soils formed in more than 41 cm (16 inches) of herbaceous organic materials over marly material. Houghton soils formed in herbaceous organic material more than 130 cm (51 inches) thick. Edwards and Martisco soils do not have sandy textures within the particle-size control section. Moston and Toto soils formed in herbaceous organic material over coprogenous material."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. In the northern range of the Madaus series, the depth of seasonal high water table in the undrained phase can range from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between September and June. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the organic material, moderately low in the marly material, and high or very high in the sandy material. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the organic material, slow in the marly material, and rapid in the sandy material."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nHistic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Oap horizon).\nAquic conditions: redoximorphic features present in all horizons below the Oap horizon.\nCarbonatic soil material: from 23 to 122 cm (9 to 48 inches) (C1, C2, C3).\nThe Madaus series was earlier considered a sandy substratum phase of the Martisco soils. The Madaus series was developed to replace the Martisco soils with a sandy 2C horizon in the lower part of the particle-size control section in the Elkhart County and Pulaski County, Indiana soil surveys. Many areas mapped Edwards soils that have been drained and subsequently subsided will be re-correlated to the Madaus series during the update process.\nThe clay substratum phase located in the northern range of the series will become a new series during the update process.\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 155026 represents the typical pedon.\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 155025 represents the undrained phase.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (S94IN-039-014) from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE. Transect data (T94IN-039-146) for the typical pedon is on file in the MLRA project office in Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 100 percent Madaus and similar soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
