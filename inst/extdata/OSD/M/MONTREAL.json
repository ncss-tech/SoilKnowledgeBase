    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the fragipan ranges from 14 to 40 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 35 to 80 inches. The soil ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid above the glossic horizon and strongly acid to slightly acid in the rest of the profile. Gravel content ranges from 5 to 20 percent above the glossic horizons and 10 to 30 percent in the glossic horizon. Cobble content ranges from 10 to 30 percent above the glossic horizons and 15 to 45 percent in the glossic horizon. Stone content ranges from 1 to 10 percent and boulder content ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout the profile. The volume of rock fragments averages from 16 to 35 percent in the particle-size control section and 35 to 60 percent in the glossic horizon.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. The E horizon has hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2. The A and E horizons are gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly analogues of very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and loamy fine sand.\nThe Bhs and Bs horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4. The Bhs and Bs horizons are gravelly, very gravelly or cobbly and very cobbly analogues of very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and loamy fine sand.\nThe E part of the 2(E/B)x, 2(B/E)x and 2E/B horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3. The E part is very cobbly loamy fine sand or very cobbly loamy very fine sand.  The B part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 4. The B part is very cobbly fine sandy loam or very cobbly very fine sandy loam. The fragipan horizon is very hard or extremely hard when dry and firm to extremely firm when moist.\nWhen the 2C horizon is present, it has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4.  It is gravelly, very gravelly, cobbly or very cobbly sandy loam or fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have 3CR horizons."

They have formed in a loamy eolian mantle underlain by gravelly loamy or sandy till which appears to have been derived from the Portage Lake Lava Series. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 36 inches, and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F. The local climate is affected by Lake Superior causing high snowfall."
