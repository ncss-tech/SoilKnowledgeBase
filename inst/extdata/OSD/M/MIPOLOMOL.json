  "REVDATE": "06/2006",
  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mipolomol series consists of very shallow or shallow to fractured bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from bedded shale and sandstone. Mipolomol soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
