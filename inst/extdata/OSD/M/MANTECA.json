  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 62 to 63 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 5 to 20 inches is usually dry all of the time from May to November and usually moist all the rest of the year.  Distinct or prominent mottles are generally present in the cemented material and are present in the lower B horizons in some pedons.  The particle-size control section from a depth of 10 inches to the duripan is 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/1 or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1 or 3/2.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw and Bk horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4 or 3/2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe 2Bqkm and 2Bq horizon is 10YR 6/1, 7/1 or 7/2.  Moist color is 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 6/1 or 6/2.  It has a 1 to 5 mm thick indurated laminar capping over weakly to strongly cemented material.  The laminar capping occurs intermittently with depth.  Some pedons are interbedded between cemented material.  The interbedded horizons have variable textures and lack cementation.\nThe 3C horizon is 10YR 6/1, 7/1, 7/2 or 8/2.  Moist color is 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 6/1 or 6/2.  It is stratified loamy sand to loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Dense ground fog often occurs in the winter months.  Mean annual precipitation is 11 to 12 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F; mean July temperature is 77 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 260 to 280 days."

Extensive pumping of water for irrigation and for domestic use has lowered the water table in most areas to a depth of 5 feet or more.  A system of reclamation projects has reduced the hazard of flooding."
