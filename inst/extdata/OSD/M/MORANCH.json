  "OVERVIEW": "The Moranch series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  The Moranch soils are on fan skirts and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
