Haverdad and Haversid soils have 2.5Y or 10YR hues.  Panitchen soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the control section, ESP of 2 to 15 and accumulations of gypsum in the C horizons.  San Mateo soils have hues of 10YR or yellower.  Suwanee soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for considerably longer periods due to a lower rainfall component."
