  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mountmcull soils are on mountains. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from metamorphosed granitic rock sources. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. Elevations are 3,500 to 6,500 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches; mean annual temperature is 51 to 56 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
