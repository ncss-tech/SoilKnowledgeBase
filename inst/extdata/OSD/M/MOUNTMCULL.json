  "REVDATE": "11/2015",
  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mountmcull series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from metamorphosed granitic sources. Mountmcull soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

Elevations are 3,500 to 6,500 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, intermittently moist summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with lesser secondary peak in the summer, typical of the Mojave Desert transitional to Sonoran Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches; mean annual temperature is 51 to 56 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
