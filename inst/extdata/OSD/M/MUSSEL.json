  "OVERVIEW": "The Mussel series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  The soils are on alluvial fans, hills, and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
