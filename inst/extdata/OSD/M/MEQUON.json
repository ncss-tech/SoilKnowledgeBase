  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mequon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in thin loess and in the underlying silty clay loam till on ground moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

The well drained Ozaukee soils have more sloping relief and form a drainage sequence with Mequon soils. Where the Mequon soils border on the reddish clay drift areas, the well drained Kewaunee soils and somewhat poorly drained Manawa soils are on nearby landscapes. The well drained Theresa soils, the moderately well drained Mayville soils, and somewhat poorly drained Lamartine soils are in areas where the silty clay loam till borders on till with a loam texture."
