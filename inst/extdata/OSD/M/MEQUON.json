The well drained Ozaukee soils have more sloping relief and form a drainage sequence with Mequon soils. Where the Mequon soils border on the reddish clay drift areas, the well drained Kewaunee soils and somewhat poorly drained Manawa soils are on nearby landscapes. The well drained Theresa soils, the moderately well drained Mayville soils, and somewhat poorly drained Lamartine soils are in areas where the silty clay loam till borders on till with a loam texture."
