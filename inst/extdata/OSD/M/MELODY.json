  "OVERVIEW": "The Melody series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from volcanic rock. The Melody soils are on shoulders and ridge tops of mountains. Slopes range from 9 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
