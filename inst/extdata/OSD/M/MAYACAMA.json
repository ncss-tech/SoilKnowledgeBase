The soil between the depths of 15 and 31 inches is dry in all parts for about 135 days from June 15 to October 15, and is moist in all parts for about 120 days from December 15 to April 15.  The particle-size control section is 15 to 25 percent clay and contains 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Base saturation (NH40Ac) is 25 to 60 percent and is less than 50 percent in some part of the B horizon.  A gravel mulch 1/2 to 1 inch thick is present in some pedons.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4 or 4/4.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Rock fragment content is 25 to 60 percent.  It is neutral to medium acid.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4 or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6 or 5/4.

Atring (T) and Straight soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Boldhill soils are over 60 inches deep and have formed on terminal moraines.  Beausite soils have a Bir horizon.  Brew (T) soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and formed on andesite.  Chamate (T), Kindig, Kanid (T), and Terbies soils are deeper than 40 inches to a lithic or paralithic contact.  Clallam soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and have 49 to 51 degrees F. MAST.  Farbar soils are deeper than 60 inches.  Inskip, Neuns and Vena soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 degrees to 54 degrees F.  Woodin (T) soils are dry in all parts for about 90 days and moist in all parts for about 180 days."
