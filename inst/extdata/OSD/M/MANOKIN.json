Manokin is named for a tributary of Tangier Sound (bordered by Hazard Point to the north and South Deal Island to the south). Manokin\nis an Algonquin (native American tribe) word which translated means earth dug out.\nBelow 75 inches few medium strong brown (7.5YR 5/8) iron concentrations were observed in this pedon.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 17 inches (Ap1, Ap2 and BE horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 17 to 37 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2 and 2Bt3 horizons)\nAquic subgroup--the soil has redox depletions with color value of 4 or more and chroma of 2 or less, and redox concentrations within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, with periodic saturation and reduction at some time during the year\nLithologic discontinuity at 23 inches\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 60 inches"
