  "OVERVIEW": "The Maverick series consists of soils that are moderately deep to densic material, well drained soils. These gently sloping to strongly sloping soils formed in calcareous, saline clayey residuum weathered from Cretaceous and Tertiary mudstone. Slope ranges from 1 to 10 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in).",
