  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 190 to 202 days. The lower part of the Bt horizon normally rests on bedrock, but there is a thin C or Ck horizon in some pedons. The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. and is never moist in some or all parts for as long as 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature at 20 inches is 48 degrees F. or more. This soil is moist for 60 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, but is dry at least 90 cumulative days during that period.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam. Channers range from 0 to 15 percent. This horizon is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5. It is heavy clay loam, sandy clay, or light clay but ranges in clay from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 5 to 40 percent, and sand from 25 to 60 percent with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. Channers average from 0 to 15 percent in the Bt horizon but range to 35 percent in the lower part of the B horizon immediately above the bedrock. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The Bidman, Big Horn, and Lawver soils are very deep and have horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation. The Briggsdale and Parmleed soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact and have horizons of carbonate accumulation. The Gibbler soils have horizons of carbonate accumulation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mughut soils are on cuesta or anticline dipslopes. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from interbedded argillaceous sandstones and shales. Elevations are 4,500 to 5,700 feet. The average annual precipitation is about 10 to 14 inches with over half falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October. The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. but ranges from 43 to 51 degrees F. The frost-free season is 110 to 130 days."

Bidman and Forkwood soils lack a lithic contact within a depth of one meter and occur in deeper fills on the slopes. Bondman and Shingle soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 inches or less and occupy higher parts of the landscape on caps, exposed bedrock, knolls, and ridges."
