  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges in thickness from 2 to 8 inches.  Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 10 to 31 inches.  The upper part of the control section consists of stratified sandy and silty material with composite texture that is coarse-loamy.  The lower part of the control section is sandy or sandy-skeletal and averages from 40 to 75 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid or moderately acid in the solum and slightly acid or neutral in the substratum.\nThe A horizon (absent in many pedons) has value moist of 2 or 3; chroma moist of 1 through 3.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR; value moist of 3 or 4; chroma moist of 3 or 4.  Texture is stratified coarse sand, fine sand, sandy loam and silt loam.\nThe 2C horizons are variegated sand or coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 40 to 75 percent and include 20 to 60 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 25 percent rounded cobble."
