    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Mascarenas soils are on strongly sloping to steep, smooth mountain slopes at elevations of 9,000 to 11,000 feet.  These soils formed in material weathered from sandstone and shales of the Pennsylvania Formation.  Precipitation is 25 to 40 inches per year and comes as winter snow and rain and late summer rain.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 40 degrees F., and average summer soil temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost free season is 50 to 70 days."
