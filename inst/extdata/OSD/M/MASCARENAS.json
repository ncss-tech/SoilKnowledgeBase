  "OVERVIEW": "The Mascarenas series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandstone and shale.  Mascarenas soils are on sides of mountains and have slopes of 15 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 810 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
