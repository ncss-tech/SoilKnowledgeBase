  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Maplegrove series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands of the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).. These soils formed in a thin mantle of silty loess over a thin mantle of loess over clayey residium. Slope gradient ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.",
