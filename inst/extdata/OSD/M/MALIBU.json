  "OVERVIEW": "The Malibu series consists of moderately deep to soft bedrock, moderately well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from inter-bedded shale and sandstone. Malibu soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
