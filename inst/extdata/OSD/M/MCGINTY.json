  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The McGinty series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rock. McGinty soils are on flood plains, valley floors, alluvial flats, fan remnants, and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7\ninches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
