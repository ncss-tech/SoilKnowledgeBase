Aycab soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Cinderspring soils have 15 to 30 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Coutis and Earcree soils lack B horizons and have textures of fine sandy loam or coarser in the particle size control section.  Foxvire soils have mollic epipedons 16 to 25 inches thick.  Gardners Fork and Hailman soils average 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Naz soils average less than 13 percent clay and the depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Razorba soils have 15 to 35 percent (by volume) rock fragments and a moderately coarse textured control section and moderately rapid permeability.  Shook soils have bedrock at depths of 30 to 50 inches.  Skyway soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Taral and Tosp soils lack a cambic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moonlight soils are on concave mountain and canyon slopes and are associated with drainageways.  Aspect is dominantly north and east.  Slopes commonly are 35 to 55 percent but range from 20 to 60 percent.  Elevation is 5,000 to 7,500 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium from loess and alluvium and colluvium from a variety of sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 41 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches.  The frost-free season is 30 to 70 days."

The Cedarhill, Camelback, and Valmar soils are loamy-skeletal and frigid.  In addition, the Valmar soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Greys soils are fine-silty and have an albic and argillic horizons.  Hades soils are fine-loamy, frigid and have an argillic horizon.  The Cedarhill, Camelback, Hades, and Valmar soils are on mountain slopes with dominantly convex south and west aspects.  The Greys and Pavohroo soils are on mountain slopes as are Moonlight soils.  Greys soils typically have more gentle slopes.  Pavohroo soils are at slightly higher elevations."
