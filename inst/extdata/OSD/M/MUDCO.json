    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the duripan ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F. from about March 15 to December 1 (255 days) and is above 47 degrees F. from about April 15 to November 15 (210 days).  The soil between depths of 10 to 20 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 until November 10 (145 days).  The soil moisture control section is dry more than half the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Clay content ranges from 5 to 10 percent.  Content of organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent in the surface 5 to 9 inches.  Gravel range from 15 to 25 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 5/2 or 5/4 and moist color of 10YR 3/4, 4/3; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/2 or 4/4.  The Bt horizon is sandy loam or gravelly sandy clay loam with the clay content ranging from 10 to 25 percent and average greater than is percent clay.\nThe Bqm horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2, 6/3; 7.5YR 7/2 or 7/4 and moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4 or 7.5YR 5/4.  The Bqm is indurated and has massive or platy structure.  The Bqm is extremely or very hard when dry and extremely or very firm when moist and is always brittle.  It contains gravel size fragments (2 to 5 millimeter) of basalt and tuff.  Thin seams of silica occur throughout the Bqm."

Aned soils are calcareous in the duripan, lack gravel in the solum and have a mean annual soil temperature that ranges from 53 to 54 degrees F.   Roval series are calcareous and moderately or strongly alkaline in the lower part of the solum and have a mean annual soil temperature that ranges from 53 to 54 degrees F.  Terlan series are calcareous in the lower part of the B horizon and in the duripan."
