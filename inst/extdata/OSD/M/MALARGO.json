  "OVERVIEW": "The Malargo series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium high in lime and gypsum on fan piedmonts and broad alluvial basins. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
