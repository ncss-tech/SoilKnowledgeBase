  "OVERVIEW": "The Munuscong series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial deposits over calcareous clayey materials on lake plains and ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
