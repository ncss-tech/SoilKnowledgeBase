Munuscong soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial deposits over calcareous clayey materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1016 mm (28 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.6 to 8.3 degrees C (42 to 47 degrees F)."

The well drained, finer textured Isabella soils and the moderately well drained Nester soils are on higher landscape positions adjacent to the Munuscong soils. The coarser textured Pinconning soils and the finer textured Sims soils are on similar landscape positions."
