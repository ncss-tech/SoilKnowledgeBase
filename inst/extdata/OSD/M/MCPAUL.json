  "OVERVIEW": "The McPaul series consists of very deep, moderately well or somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 90 to 240 centimeters of calcareous, stratified alluvium from loess uplands.  These soils are in settling basins and near drainage channels on narrow flood plains of tributary streams that flow across the slack water areas of flood plains in river valleys.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 815 millimeters.",

Along narrow tributaries a few areas are used for permanent pasture because they are small or cut up badly by channels. The native vegetation is big blue stem, little bluestem, switchgrass, and other grasses of the tall grass prairie."
