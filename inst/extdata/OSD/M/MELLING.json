  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Melling series consists of shallow, moderately permeable, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from intermediate and basic igneous rock.  Melling soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
