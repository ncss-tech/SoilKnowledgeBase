Anuad soils have an aridic soil moisture regime.  Bellenmine, Cropper and Pernty soils have a mollic epipedon that is 12 inches thick or less and an aridic soil moisture regime.  Cleavage soils have a mollic epipedon that is 12 inches thick or less and a xeric soil moisture regime that borders on aridic.  Cleavmor soils have secondary carbonates in the argillic horizon and an aridic soil moisture regime.  Gabica have a xeric soil moisture regime that borders on aridic.  Gaciba soils have 16 to 24 percent clay in the particle size control section and an aridic soil moisture regime.  Gidwin soils have 18 to 24 percent clay in the particle size control section and a xeric soil moisture regime that borders on aridic.  Grosschat soils have a mollic epipedon that is 12 inches thick or less and an aridic soil moisture regime.  Hutchley soils are formed in metasedimentery rocks and loess and have a xeric soil moisture regime that borders on aridic.  Mascamp soils have an aridic soil moisture regime.  Pernog soils have a particle size control section dominated by stones and a xeric soil moisture regime that borders on aridic.  Poisoncreek soils have a paralithic contact over the lithic contact.  Rozara, Shalcleav, Shalper, Slatter, and Tweener soils are less than 14 inches deep to a lithic contact. Tractuff soils have less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Melling soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops.  Slopes are 5 to 60 percent.  Elevations are 5,200 to 8,100 feet.  These soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from intermediate and basic igneous bedrock.  The soils are in a typic xeric climate with annual precipitation ranging from 16 to 22 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 39 degrees to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 64 to 67 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 60 to 100 days."
