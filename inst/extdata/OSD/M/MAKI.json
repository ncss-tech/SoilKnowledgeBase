  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The soil is usually moist in all horizons during part of the year but is dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches or to a lithic contact for 60 to 80 consecutive days during summer and fall.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 48 to 50 degrees F. The particle-size control section has from 35 to 70 percent gravel, cobbles, and stones. The soil is very slightly to strongly effervescent and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon commonly has value of 6 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 3, but thin subhorizons in the upper part have value of 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 in some pedons. It has weak fine and medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Gravel ranges from 20 to 35 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4. This horizon is loam or silt loam. It has fine or coarse subangular blocky structure or it is massive. Gravel ranges from 30 to 55 percent, cobbles and stones range from 5 to 15 percent."

In addition, the Brownbear soils have Bt horizons and have a mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F. The Burwill soils are deep to a lithic contact. The Indleton soils have Bt horizons and are very deep. The Itat soils are very deep. The Pardaloe soils are deep to a lithic contact and have Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maki soils are on south-facing glaciated uplands and mountainsides at elevations of 1,400 to 4,500 feet. Slopes are convex or concave, and range from 25 to 65 percent. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from calcareous rock (including shaly rock, limestone, dolomite, and hard, blocky metamorphic rock) and glacial till with component of volcanic ash and loess. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The average annual temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.; the average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 25 inches; and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

All of these soils except Hungate are noncalcareous.  Scoap and Stevens soils have a mollic epipedon and are more than 60 inches deep. Hungate soils are 40 to 60 inches deep. Rufus soils are 10 to 20 inches deep. Hartill, Hungate and Scoap soils are frigid.  Huckleberry soils are cryic."
