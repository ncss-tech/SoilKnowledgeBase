The soils formed in alluvium from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  The climate is semiarid. The average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F. mean summer temperature is 65 to 70 degrees F.  The freeze-free period is 100 to 145 days."

(A horizon)\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the C horizon).\nTorrifluventic feature: Organic carbon content is 0.3 or more in all horizons within 125 cm of the mineral surface. In places with mollic epipedons less than 10 inches thick it is assumed there is a regular decrease in organic carbon with depth.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\".\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
