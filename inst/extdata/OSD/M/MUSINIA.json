  "OVERVIEW": "The Musinia series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly or slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks. Musinia soils are on alluvial flats and floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

(A horizon)\nParticle-size control section: The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of the C horizon).\nTorrifluventic feature: Organic carbon content is 0.3 or more in all horizons within 125 cm of the mineral surface. In places with mollic epipedons less than 10 inches thick it is assumed there is a regular decrease in organic carbon with depth.\nThe classification is based on the \"Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006\".\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
