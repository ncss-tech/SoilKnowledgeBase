  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 76 to 152 cm (30 to 60 in). The depth to carbonates ranges from 91 to 152 cm (36 to 60 in). Rock fragments are mainly shale with some sandstone, limestone, and crystalline rocks. Clay content averages 35 to 45 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (5 or less dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have an A horizon 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) thick that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. They are silt loam or silty clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They are slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btg and Bg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or are neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2. They are silty clay, clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the upper part and from 2 to 10 percent in the lower part.  They are moderately acid or slightly acid in upper part and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe BCg or BC horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4. It is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 10 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 0 to 4. It is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 10 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate content in horizons that contain free carbonates ranges from 5 to 15 percent.\nIn some places, bedrock is at depths of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in), and the C horizon is silty clay or silty clay loam with channery analogues. This is identified as a shale substratum phase and is commonly noncalcareous."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hoytville, Lorain, and Monee series. Hoytville soils have a calcium carbonate content of 15 to 30 percent in the C horizon. Lorain soils have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Monee soils average more than 45 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Miner soils are in shallow depressions and narrow drainageways on till plains which have been modified by lake action and lake plains. They formed in till principally derived from acid shale. The slope gradient ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Elevation ranges from 213 to 277 m (700 to 910 ft). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 830 to 1320 mm (33 to 52 in), and the mean annual temperature ranges from about 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F). The frost-free period is 135 to 165 days."

The Ellsworth and Mahoning soils are in higher positions on the landscape than Miner soils. Trumbull soils are in similar landscape positions as Miner soils but typically have a surface layer that has color value of 4 or more, moist."

Depth to the top of a perched and/or apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1.0 ft) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 ft) below the surface from October to May in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible or low. Frequent long duration ponding occurs during extended wet periods."

The shale substratum phase that has been correlated in earlier surveys will be recorrelated to a new series as part of a future MLRA project.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. ochric epipedon - 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. argillic horizon - 20 to 91 cm (8 to 36 in) (Btg1, Btg2, Btg3 horizons).\n3. aquic conditions - 0 to 147 cm (0 to 58 in).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
