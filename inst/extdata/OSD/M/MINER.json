  "OVERVIEW": "The Miner series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in low-lime till principally derived from acid shale on lake plains and till plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1065 mm (42 in), and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

Rock fragments are mainly shale with some sandstone, limestone, and crystalline rocks. Clay content averages 35 to 45 percent in the particle-size control section.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (5 or less dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have an A horizon 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) thick that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. They are silt loam or silty clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They are slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btg and Bg horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or are neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2. They are silty clay, clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the upper part and from 2 to 10 percent in the lower part.  They are moderately acid or slightly acid in upper part and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe BCg or BC horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4. It is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 10 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 0 to 4. It is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam. Rock fragment content ranges from 2 to 10 percent. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate content in horizons that contain free carbonates ranges from 5 to 15 percent.\nIn some places, bedrock is at depths of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 in), and the C horizon is silty clay or silty clay loam with channery analogues. This is identified as a shale substratum phase and is commonly noncalcareous."
