Miami soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 366 meters (600 to 1200 feet) above mean sea level."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 61 to 91 cm (2.0 to 3.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. Potential for surface water runoff is medium on the gentle slopes and high on the steeper slopes. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately low or low in the underlying dense till. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum, moderately slow in the lower part of the solum, and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till."
