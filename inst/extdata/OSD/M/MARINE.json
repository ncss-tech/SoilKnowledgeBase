  "OVERVIEW": "The Marine series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, slowly permeable soils on nearly level or gently sloping interfluves and slightly convex summits of the Illinoian till plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in loess, or in loess and the underlying silty pedisediment.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is greater than 42 inches.  Loess thickness typically is greater than 60 inches, but in some pedons, is as thin as 55 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 48 percent clay and contains less than 7 percent sand.  The A and E horizons contain less than 10 percent sand that includes iron-manganese nodules and concretions.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap or A, and E) has properties as follows:  The Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon 2 to 6 inches in thickness with value of 2 to 4 (4 to 6 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or silt.  Clay content is 10 to 18 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 to 7 (6 to 8 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2, and typically has redoximorphic features.  Redoximorphic masses of iron accumulation in the matrix have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 8. The E horizon is silt or silt loam and contains 8 to 18 percent clay.  Reaction commonly is very strongly acid to moderately acid, but is slightly acid in some pedons.\nSome pedons have a B/E horizon about 2 or 3 inches in thickness.  These horizons are characterized as having peds of Bt material that have clay depletions (E material) on faces of peds.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Bt and Btg) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4 in the upper part and typically grading to 2, but ranging from 1 to 3, in the lower subhorizons.  Redoximorphic iron depletions and accumulations have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8.  Some pedons have subhorizons in the upper part of the Bt horizon that have common or many clay depletions on faces of peds.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay in the upper part and is silty clay loam or silt loam in the lower part.  Clay content averages 35 to 48 percent in the upper part and averages 15 to 35 percent in the lower part.  Individual subhorizons in the lower part of some pedons range to 38 percent clay.  Sand content is less than 7 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the upper part and is strongly acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Clay content is 15 to 30 percent and sand content is less than 7 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe lower part of the series control section (C or 2C) has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 7; and chroma of 1 to 3.  Yellowish brown or strong brown redoximorphic masses of iron accumulation in the matrix are common.  The C horizon typically is silt loam, but some pedons have a 2C horizon or horizons of older soils below a depth of 55 inches.  These horizons are silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Clay content is 12 to 35 percent and sand content is 5 to 40 percent.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marine soils are on nearly level or gently sloping interfluves and slightly convex summits of the Illinoian till plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in 55 to more than 80 inches of loess, and the underlying silty pedisediment.  The material beneath the loess is the silty pedisediment that lies above the till and contains a component of sand.  The loess is late Wisconsinan Peoria Loess and the underlying silty material is early Wisconsinan Roxana Silt.  The soils are underlain at depths of about 5 to 8 feet by Illinoian till that commonly contains a strongly developed paleosol.  The parent materials in and underlying these soils are weathered to depths of 10 or 12 feet.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 40 inches, frost-free period is 170 to 200 days, and elevation is 400 to 800 feet above mean sea level."

All of the associated soils except for Pierron soils do not have an abrupt textural change from the E horizon to the Bt horizon.  The somewhat poorly drained Blair and Bunkum soils and the well drained Hickory soils are on side slopes of drainageways below the Marine soils.  Also, Blair and Bunkum soils are in a fine-silty family while Hickory soils are in a fine-loamy family.  The somewhat poorly drained Coulterville and Darmstadt soils contain a concentration of exchangeable sodium in the subsoil.  The moderately well drained Homen soils are on higher or narrower convex summits.  The poorly drained Pierron soils are on nearly level areas that are slightly depressional in some places, and are adjacent to Marine soils in many places."

Albic horizon - from a depth of 9 to 17 inches (E horizon).  Argillic horizon - from a depth of approximately 17 to 62 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btg1, Btg2, and BCtg horizons).  Albaqualf feature - abrupt textural change from the E horizon to the Bt1 horizon.  Aquic conditions - periodic saturation and reduction, indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil."
