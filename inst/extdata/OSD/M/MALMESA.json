  "OVERVIEW": "The Malmesa series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks mainly basalt. Malmesa soils are on mountain slopes, hills, mesas, and plateaus. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
