Batavia, Deroin, Downs, Harvard, Knox, Luana, Watkins, Waubeek and Yutan soils average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. Bowes soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Churchtown, Myrtle, and Newhouse soils have more than 15 percent sand in the upper part of the series control section. Ella and Festina soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section and average more than 15 percent sand. Frankville, Massbach, Nasset, Oak Center soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths less than 152 cm (60 inches). Gladek soils formed in lacustrine sediments. Greenbush and Mannon soils have zones within 152 cm (60 inches) that are frequently saturated for periods longer than one month. Hersey soils have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section and average more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. Mellott soils have less than 50 percent silt in a horizon in the lower part of the series control section."

Slope gradients typically are 2 to 15 percent, but range from 0 to 45 percent. Mean annual temperature varies from 7.2 to 12.2 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation varies from 760 to 914 mm (30 to 36 inches)."

Port Byron and Tama soils are on similar slopes, but are on broad interstream divides further from the drainageways. Tama soils have a mollic epipedon and contain more clay in the finest part of the Bt horizon. Seaton and Fayette soils are on similar or more sloping areas closer to the drainageways. Fayette soils are Typic Hapludalfs and contain more clay in the finest part of the Bt horizon."
