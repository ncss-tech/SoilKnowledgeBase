  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist but is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 55 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. The solum has 5 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles, with an average of less than 35 percent total rock fragments. Below 40 inches, rock fragments may range from 0 to 65 percent. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR. The solum is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam or gravelly loam with 18 to 25 percent clay. It has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles.\nAn AB horizon is present in some pedons with color and texture similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 2 to 4 dry. It is gravelly loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay. It has 15 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy loam, or silt loam with 3 to 20 percent clay. It has 0 to 60 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cheoah, Colepoint, Crutchfield, Jeffrey, Molalla, Plott, Santeetlah, Threeforks, and Tuckasegee series. Cheoah and Molalla soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to paralithic bedrock contact. Colepoint soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to lithic bedrock contact. Crutchfield and Jeffrey soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to lithic bedrock. In addition, Molalla soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the solum. Plott soils have a solum depth of 30 to more than 60 inches, chroma of 4 to 8 moist or dry in the Bw horizon and formed in residuum derived from felsic to mafic igneous and high-grade metamorhphic rocks. Santeetlah soils have channer and flagstone-shaped rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are derived, from metasedimentary rocks. Threeforks soils have a solum thickness of greater than 60 inches, have mollic colors which extend to a depth of 60 inches or more, have rock fragments mica schist origin, and allow hues redder than 10YR in the particle-size control section. The Tuckasegee soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick, have rock fragments of granite, mica gneiss, or schist origin, and allow hues redder than 10YR in the particle-size control section. Additionally, the Cheoah, Plott, Santeetlah, and Tuckasegee soils are mapped in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of the southeastern United States."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Meda soils occur on alluvial fans and stream terraces. Elevations are 20 to 1,800 feet. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed in loamy alluvium and colluvium from sedimentary or igneous rock types. The average January temperature is 40 degrees F., and the average July temperature is 61 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is typically 60 to 100 inches but may range to 130 inches in the interior valleys of Curry County, Oregon. The frost-free period is 120 to 240 days."

Bohannon soils have andic soil properties in the upper part of the A horizon, and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Hembre soils have a solum and depth to bedrock of 40 to 60 inches and hue of 5YR in the subsoil. Kirkendall soils are fine-silty; Nekoma soils are coarse-loamy; both soils occur on flood plains and are subject to common flooding. Preacher soils have andic soil properties in the upper part of the A horizon. Treharne soils are moderately well drained, have an argillic horizon, and occur on low stream terraces. Wasson soils occur on flood plains, are poorly drained, have 0 to 5 percent gravel throughout profile, and have 5 to 10 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section."
