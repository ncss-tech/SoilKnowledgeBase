  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mollco series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation. These soils are in depressional areas with slope less than 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 20.0 degrees C (68 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1422 mm (56 in).",
