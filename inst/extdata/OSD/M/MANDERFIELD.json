  "OVERVIEW": "The Manderfield series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  These soils are on fan remnants and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 65 to 67 degrees F.  These soils are dry in the 4 to 12 inch depth less than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., and are continually dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days during the summer months in more than 6 out of 10 years.  The moisture regime is xeric bordering aridic\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4. Value of 5 dry and 3 moist extend to depths of less than 20 inches. The Bt horizon is loam or clay loam containing 20 to 35 percent clay. This horizon has weak medium or moderate fine subangular blocky structure. It has secondary carbonate accumulations of 3 to 10 percent in the soil mass and as thin coatings on the gravel.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Ck horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is very gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.  The 2Ck horizon has 45 to 90 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles that are thinly coated with carbonates."

Slopes are mostly 1 to 6 percent, but small areas range up to 30 percent.  The soils formed in 20 inches of medium textured alluvium over a deep layer of river washed gravel and sand or loamy sand derived from intermediate igneous rocks. The climate is semiarid. Mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 F., average summer temperature is 66 to 68 degrees F., average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches. The average frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
