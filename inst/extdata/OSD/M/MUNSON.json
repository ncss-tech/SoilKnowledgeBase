Some pedons have an A horizon with colors, texture, structure and consistence similar to the Ap horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam in the upper part and silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay texture in the lower part.  Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular, or subangular blocky or platy in the upper part and weak, fine, medium prismatic, or moderate or strong, very fine to coarse blocky in the lower part.  Consistence is friable or firm in the upper part and firm or very firm, sticky or very sticky, and plastic or very plastic in the lower part.\nThe C horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 5G, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay or silty clay.  Structure is weak or moderate, medium or coarse prismatic parting to moderate or strong, fine to coarse angular or subangular blocky, or they have varves that part to thin or medium plates.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are currently no other series in the same family.  Binghamville, Buxton, Panton, Raynham, Scantic, Swanton and Whately are similar soils in related families.  Binghamville and Raynham soils have a coarse-silty particle-size control section.  Buxton and Scantic soils have a fine particle-size control section.  Panton soils have an argillic horizon and a very fine particle-size control section.  Swanton and Whately soils have coarse-loamy particle-size in the upper part of the control section and Whately soils have a frigid temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Munson soils are level to moderately steep soils on lake or marine plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in silty over clayey lacustrine or marine sediments.  The climate is humid continental with cool summers and cold winters.  The mean annual air temperature ranges 45 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual participation is 30 to 48 inches.  The frost-free season ranges from 130 to 195 days."

The well drained Suffield, moderately well drained Buxton, poorly drained Scantic, and very poorly drained Biddeford soils are members of a drainage sequence with Munson soils.  Belgrade, Binghamville, Panton, and Raynham are in similar positions on the landscape and Birdsall and Covington soils are in lower positions on the landscape.  Belgrade, Binghamville, Birdsall and Raynham soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections.  Covington and Panton soils have very fine particle-size control sections.  Eldridge, Elmwood, Enosburg and Swanton soils are on outwash landforms.  Eldridge and Enosburg soils have sandy over loamy particle-size control sections.  Elmwood and Swanton soils have a coarse-loamy over clayey particle-size control section."

The former classification was coarse-silty over clayey, mixed, nonacid, mesic Aeric Haplaquepts.  2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 24 inches (Bw and Bg horizons).\nc.  Epiaquepts feature - a horizons at a depth less than 20 inches (50 cm) that have matrix chroma of 2 or less and redoximorphic features (Bw1 horizon).\nd.  Aeric feature - horizon within the upper 30 inches (75 cm) that has chroma greater than 2 (Bw2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
