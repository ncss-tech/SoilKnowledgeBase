  "STATES": "NY,VT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Munson series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine and marine silts over clays on lake or marine plains.  Permeability is moderately slow and moderate in the upper part of the profile and slow to very slow in the lower part.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

The former classification was coarse-silty over clayey, mixed, nonacid, mesic Aeric Haplaquepts.  2.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 24 inches (Bw and Bg horizons).\nc.  Epiaquepts feature - a horizons at a depth less than 20 inches (50 cm) that have matrix chroma of 2 or less and redoximorphic features (Bw1 horizon).\nd.  Aeric feature - horizon within the upper 30 inches (75 cm) that has chroma greater than 2 (Bw2 horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
