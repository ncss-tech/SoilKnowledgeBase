  "OVERVIEW": "The Minco series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in material weathered from loamy eolian deposits of Pleistocene age. These soils are on treads and risers of stream terraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 864 millimeters (34 in). Mean annual air temperature is 16.6 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
