    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the silty clay or clay layer is 76 to 127 centimeters (30 to 50 inches). Some pedons have a layer of loess as much as 61 centimeters (24 inches) in thickness overlying outwash. The depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 76 to 137 centimeters (30 to 54 inches). The depth to carbonates ranges from 76 to 137 centimeters (30 to 54 inches). The mollic epipedon is 25 to 61 centimeters (10 to 24 inches) in thickness and includes the upper part of the B horizon in some pedons. The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay and from 15 to 40 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe Ap,or A horizon has  hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or less commonly loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons contain an AB horizon.\nThe BA or 2BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam. It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe Bt,or 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam in the part formed in loess, and clay loam, silty clay loam with a high content of sand, or less commonly sandy clay loam in the part formed in outwash. Clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent and sand content ranges from 15 to 50 percent. Content of rock fragments is less than 10 percent. It is moderately acid to neutral and typically the reaction increases with increasing depth.\nThe BC,2BC, or 3BC horizon formed in outwash or lacustrine sediments, have hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay loam or silty clay loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline and contains carbonates in some pedons.\nThe 2Cd, or 3Cd horizon formed in till or lacustrine sediments, has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay or clay. Clay content ranges from 40 to 50 percent and sand content is less than 10 percent. Content of rock fragments is less than 10 percent. Some pedons contain thin strata of other textures. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and contains carbonates. Bulk density of the 2Cd or 3Cd horizons ranges from 1.7 to 1.9 gm/cc."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils primarily formed in loamy outwash and silty clay or clay till or lacustrine sediments, but most pedons contain a component of loess or other silty material as much as 61 centimeters (24 inches) in thickness at the surface. Slope gradients range from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature varies from about 8 to 12 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation varies from about 762 to 1,041 millimeters (30 to 41 inches), frost free days ranges from 160 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 189 to 311 meters (620 to 1,020 feet) above sea level."

The Bryce, Clarence, Swygert, and Wenona soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. The poorly drained Bryce soils are on lower parts of the landscape. The somewhat poorly drained Clarence and Swygert soils and the moderately well drained Wenona soils are on similar adjacent parts of the landscape but lack the loamy outwash sediments in the solum. The somewhat poorly drained Mokena soils and the poorly drained Reddick soils are in a drainage sequence with Mona soils. They are lower on the landscape and have redoximorphic features higher in the solum. The well drained Proctor soils are on higher parts of the landscape and have less sand in the particle-size control section and less clay in the lower part of the series control section. They formed in loess and outwash."
