The Bryce, Clarence, Swygert, and Wenona soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. The poorly drained Bryce soils are on lower parts of the landscape. The somewhat poorly drained Clarence and Swygert soils and the moderately well drained Wenona soils are on similar adjacent parts of the landscape but lack the loamy outwash sediments in the solum. The somewhat poorly drained Mokena soils and the poorly drained Reddick soils are in a drainage sequence with Mona soils. They are lower on the landscape and have redoximorphic features higher in the solum. The well drained Proctor soils are on higher parts of the landscape and have less sand in the particle-size control section and less clay in the lower part of the series control section. They formed in loess and outwash."
