  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mopana soils are on plateaus.  They typically occur on summit positions. These soils formed in eolian volcanic ash over residuum derived from basalt.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,195 to 2,700  meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 410 mm, the mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 100 days."

Volcanic glass content estimated from laboratory data on nearby pedons in Mineral County.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Volcanic glass content determined locally by optical grain count with a polarizing petrographic microscope.\nUser Pedon ID: 2007NV021094.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
