  "OVERVIEW": "The Mojo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from extrusive igneous rock.  Mojo soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
