Anasazi, Chugcity, Chupadera, Kaiar, and Sazi soils are moderately deep.  Chroder soils are dryer in the soil moisture control section and receive only 7 to 10 inches of rain.  Cobbra soils contain 18 to 35 percent clay and average 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate in the particle-size control section.  Mivida and Yattle soils have a calcic horizon at 20 inches or deeper.  Harvey soils are moist in the control section during the spring and early summer months and contain 18 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Chugcity, Chupadera, Harvey, Nola, and Yattle soils are in the Western Great Plains (LRR-G) and are more moist in the soil moisture control section during May and June. Smithpond soils have mean annual soil temperature lower than 52 degrees F. and are in MLRA 34B-Warm Central Desertic Basins and Plateaus."

Slope ranges from 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium and eolian material derived from sandstone and limestone.  The soils are in a warm, semiarid climate with average annual precipitation ranging from 9 to 14 inches. The precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year with a slight bulge in July, August, September and October.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 165 days."

Based on the Newhall Simulations for Utah stations (1961 to 1990 normal) the soils are dry in the moisture control section during the 4 months following the summer solstice in spite of the higher precipitation levels in the late summer and early fall.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy, Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nUpdates and revisions for the correlation of Arches National Park (TU687), February 2009, CEM\nUpdated for the correlation of the Emery Area, Utah. Air and soil temperatures were adjusted to account for the differences between MLRA 34B and 35. Soils correlated as Milok in Utah have cooler air and soil temperatures and should be evaluated.
