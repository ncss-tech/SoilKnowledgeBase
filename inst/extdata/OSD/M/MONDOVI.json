The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days. The control section is silt loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and 70 to 80 percent silt.\nThe Ap horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. It has weak or moderate granular structure. It is slightly alkaline to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon, to a depth of at least 40 inches, has value of 2 to 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry. Below 40 inches the value is 3 to 5 dry and chroma is 1 to 3 dry or moist. It is slightly alkaline or neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mondovi soils are on flood plains and drainageways at elevations of 1,500 to 3,100 feet. The soils formed in silty alluvium from loess washed from the uplands and deposited in narrow tributary stream bottoms. Summers are hot and dry and winters are cold and moist. Average annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches. Average January temperature is about 28 degrees F, average July temperature is about 68 degrees F.   The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F. The average frost-free season is about 110 to 160 days."

Athena and Palouse soils have a regular decrease of organic matter with depth. Caldwell soils are more than 18 percent clay. Athena soils are on canyon sides, hills and plateaus.  Caldwell and Covello soils are on flood plains.  Palouse soils are on hills."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nmollic epipedon  from the surface to more than 60 inches with an irregular decrease in organic carbon\nParticle-size control section  from 10 to 40 inches\nThe type location was moved from Spokane County in 07/2010 to Whitman County after investigations in 2002 and 2005 of the Spokane type location revealed enough volcanic ash influence to meet Vitrandic surbgroup criteria. In addition to the ash influence, Mondovi was a minor component located in a map unit dominated by soils with aquic conditions within 20 inches of the surface. A taxadjunct to the Mondovi series is currently being recognized in Spokane County as: Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic, Vitrandic Haploxerolls. The Spokane taxadjunct soil is assumed to be Cumulic; however, changes in soil taxonomy recognize the Vitrandic subgroup first.\nFurther investigation in MLRA 9 is needed to confirm the Cumulic subgroup feature and assess the extent of the influence of volcanic ash and evaluate the presence/absence of an apparent water table."
