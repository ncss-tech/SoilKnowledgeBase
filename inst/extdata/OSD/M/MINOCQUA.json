  "OVERVIEW": "The Minocqua series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils which are moderately deep to stratified sandy outwash.  They formed mostly in silty and loamy alluvium underlain by sandy outwash on outwash plains and outwash terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy alluvium and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth are measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon, thickness of the silty and loamy mantle, and depth to sandy outwash all range from 20 to 40 inches.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the silty and loamy mantle. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the silty and loamy mantle but is typically less than 15 percent.  Volume of gravel averages from 3 to 50 percent in the sandy outwash but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline throughout the soil.  Carbonates are absent to depths of 60 inches or more.  Redox concentrations typically are throughout the profile below the A horizon.  Redox depletions are more than 50 percent of the matrix or coatings on ped faces.  Saturation occurs at or near the surface for long periods.\nThe O horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or it is neutral in hue. It has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 2.\nSome pedons have an A horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is less than 6 inches thick.   Texture is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or the mucky analogs.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bg horizon (Bg horizon in pedons without a silty mantle) has color like the Bg horizon described above.  Typically texture is loam or gravelly loam but in some pedons, it is sandy loam or fine sandy loam or the gravelly analogs. Horizons with texture of sandy loam or fine sandy have less than 50 percent fine or coarser sand or are less than 5 inches thick\nSome pedons have a 2Bw horizon (Bw horizon in pedons without a silty mantle) with hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is like that of the 2Bg horizon described above.\nThe 3BCg or 3BC horizon (2BCg or 2BC horizon in pedons without a silty mantle) has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is sand, loamy sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 3Cg or 3C horizon (2Cg or 2C horizon in pedons without a silty mantle) has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  Typically Texture is stratified with sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.

Major species of trees include American elm, balsam fir, black ash, black spruce, eastern hemlock, northern white cedar, quaking aspen, red maple, tamarack, and white ash.  A few areas have been cleared and used for cropland or pastureland."

Data indicates a clay pickup below the E horizon, but no evidence of clay skins were noted in describing the soil.  The increase in clay is considered an expression of the nature of the parent material (depositional strata) and not genetic.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
