    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section is 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 65 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Base saturation is assumed to be 50 to 70 percent.\nThe A and AB horizon has a value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.  The upper part of the A horizon has acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent and volcanic glass of 5 to 20 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has 18 to 30 percent clay and 65 to 80 percent channers."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mowako soils are on very steep south-facing side slopes of mountains.  Elevations range from 1800 to 4200 feet. Slopes are 30 to 80 percent.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Fawnspring soils are fine, montmorillonitic, are deep to bedrock and are on north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Littlefawn soils are fine.  Mutton soils are ashy-skeletal, very deep to bedrock, and are on north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Wakamo soils are clayey-skeletal, are shallow to bedrock, and are on adjacent south-facing side slopes of mountains."
