  "OVERVIEW": "The Mowako series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on side slopes of mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash.  Slopes are 30 to 80 percent.    The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section is 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 65 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Base saturation is assumed to be 50 to 70 percent.\nThe A and AB horizon has a value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter.  The upper part of the A horizon has acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent and volcanic glass of 5 to 20 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam.  It has 18 to 30 percent clay and 65 to 80 percent channers."

Mutton soils are ashy-skeletal, very deep to bedrock, and are on north-facing side slopes of mountains.  Wakamo soils are clayey-skeletal, are shallow to bedrock, and are on adjacent south-facing side slopes of mountains."
