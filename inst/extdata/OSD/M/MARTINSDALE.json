  "OVERVIEW": "The Martinsdale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, escarpments and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

(The dry period in the summer months is almost long enough to be xeric,  but as described still fits the concept of ustic.)\nSoil interpretation records:  MT0234, MT0299, MT1042, MT1129, MT1286.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory samples S57MT-107-5, 574MT-5-2.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
