  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from 0 to 30 cm (0 to 12 inches) (A, Bt horizons)\nArgillic horizon: from 10 to 30 cm (4 to 12 inches) (Bt horizon)\nCalcic horizon: from 30 to 203 cm (12 to 40 inches) (Bk1, Bk2, 2Bk2, 2Bk3, 2Bk4 horizons). The calcic horizon is not a hard indurated petrocalcic horizon, it is not continuously cemented. It is a discontinuous layer that consists of cemented materials that offer a distinct resistance to digging implements and water movement. It has irregular thickness and cementation characteristics. The cemented parts range from extremely weakly to strongly cemented. This horizon is similar to the partially cementated horizons in the Petronodic subgroups of Aridisols.\nOxyaquic feature: episaturation and redoximorphic concentrations in the 10 to 30 cm layer (4 to 12 inches) (Bt horizon). Saturation is entirely from surface irrigation. Because the irrigation has caused redox features in the pedon, the wetness was considered part of the soil that is classified.\nParticle-size control section: the zone from 10 to 30 cm (4 to 10 inches) (entire argillic horizon)\nSeries control section: the zone from 0 to 200 cm.\nThe solum is assumed to contain some carbonates added from irrigation water.\nThe 6/2011 revision moves the type location to a pedon that represents the series concept that was developed during the initial soil survey of the Uinta County Area, 2003 to 2010. This series was originally a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed Borollic Haplargids; then was updated to fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, superactive, frigid Ustic Calciargids. The 06/2011 revision changes the classification to fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, frigid Oxyaquic Argiustolls.\nADDITIONAL DATA: This pedon was sampled for NSSL, soil survey sample number S06WY041-004.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
