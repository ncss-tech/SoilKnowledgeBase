    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the coal ash materials is generally more than 120 cm thick. The pieces are very porous and glassy, similar to volcanic materials. The fine-earth fraction includes smaller pieces of coal and slag, and the textures include sandy loam or coarser. Gravel-sized rock-like pieces of burned slag range from 10 to 75 percent.\nThe ^Au horizon may be composed of more loamy materials than below, either from filling or slopewash from surrounding areas. Colors are hue 5YR to 2.5Y, including neutral, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 8. Structure is single grain or massive, except in surface horizons that include granular and subangular blocky. Consistence is typically loose or very friable, but can range to firm where heavily compacted.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline. A thin organic layer may be found above the ^Au horizon.\nThe ^C horizons have hue 5YR to 2.5Y, including neutral, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 8. Structure is single grain or massive, except in surface horizons that include granular and subangular blocky. Consistence is typically loose or very friable, but can range to firm where heavily compacted. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nC or Cg horizons, where present, formed in the native buried parent material beneath the mantle of coal ash and slag deposits. Colors are hue 5YR to 2.5Y, including neutral, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 8. Textures include sandy loam to silt loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 20 percent.

Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Coal ash supplies accumulated over more than one hundred years of time when hard coal was the main source of heating and producer of heat for production of electricity. The material often contains debris tossed into furnaces during burning. Areas used as railroad beds contain buried railroad ties and large pieces of coal used as ballast.\nMosholu soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth; however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition, excluding them from the concept of Fluvents. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy in ICOMANTH Circular Letter 7 developed for anthropogenic soils will help to clarify this difference.\nReaction for the 2C^u7 and 3Cg horizons is estimated based on preliminary lab data for adjacent horizons due to the lack of reported field or lab data.\nComplete full characterization data was collected as pedon S2011NY005002.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 cm (^Au and ^Au2 horizons).\n2. Particle size - fragments, primarily coal slag and unburned coal, average less than 35 percent by volume in the zone from 25 cm to 100 cm (^Au1, ^Au2, ^Cu1, ^Cu2, ^Cu3, ^Cu4, ^Cu5, and part of the ^Cu6 horizon).\n3. Aquic subgroup - saturation within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface. Evidence of saturation in the form of redoximorphic depletions within 100 cm. was difficult to determine in the field based on morphology for these parent materials. After review in the field and further discussions a decision was made regarding subgroup placement based on setting and recorded evidence of field observation of seasonal water tables in several sites that indicated a predominance of wetness and presence of aquic conditions within 100 cm (versus 150 cm).  The mean and median of the physical site measurements were both less than 100 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples from pedon S2011NY005002 from Bronx County, New York, samples by KSSL, Lincoln, NE, 2013.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
