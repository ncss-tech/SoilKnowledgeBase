  "STATES": "LA,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mowata series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey fluviomarine deposits of late Pleistocene age. These nearly level soils occur on broad flats along drainageways. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1549 mm (61 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
