  "OVERVIEW": "The Miles series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvial materials.  These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping terrace pediments on dissected plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees C (16.7 degrees F).",
