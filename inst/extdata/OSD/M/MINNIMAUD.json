  "OVERVIEW": "The Minnimaud series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum from sedimentary rocks.  Minnimaud soils are on fan remnants and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 4 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
