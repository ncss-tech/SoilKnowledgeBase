These soils occur on mountain slopes and fan remnants and formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum weathered from sedimentary rocks.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F. and the freeze-free period is 60 to 90 days.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches, with wettest months in May to October and driest months in February to April."
