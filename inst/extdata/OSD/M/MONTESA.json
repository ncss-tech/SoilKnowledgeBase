  "OVERVIEW": "The Montesa series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with moderately slow permeability that formed in alluvium weathered from igneous and sedimentary rocks.  Montesa soils are on alluvial fans and stream terraces and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 20 to 35 inches thick.  Depth to mottles with chroma of 2 or less ranges from 15 to 24 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section has 10 to 15 percent clay, 20 to 40 percent fine sand or coarser material, and less than 15 percent fragments larger than 2 mm.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  Where moist value is 3 and moist chroma is 2 or 3, the horizon is less than 10 inches thick. This horizon is loam or silt loam and has granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist or dry.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  This horizon has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is mainly silt loam, but is stratified layers of silt loam, loam, and fine sandy loam in some pedons.  It ranges from loamy sand to silty clay loam below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."

These soils formed in alluvium weathered from igneous and sedimentary rocks from adjacent uplands and mountainous areas.  They occur in a humid marine climate with cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The annual precipitation ranges from 70 to 110 inches.  The mean January temperature is 39 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 200 to 240 days or (32 degrees F.) 160 to 190 days."

Astoria, Boisfort, Bunker, Elochman, Lytell, Wahkiakum, and Zenker soils are well drained and have a medial control section.  Grehalem soils are well drained and have fine, loamy control section.  Knappa soils are well drained and have an umbric epipedon more than 20 inches thick.  Skamo soils have an umbric epipedon and a fine control section."
