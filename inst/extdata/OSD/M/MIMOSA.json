  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to rock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent in the surface layer and 5 percent or less below.  The fragments are mostly chert and most areas have less than 15 percent in the surface layer. The soil is medium acid to very strongly acid except the layer just above bedrock is medium acid to mildly alkaline.  Phosphorous content of each horizon is medium to high.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Value of 5 and chroma of 6 are for pedons in severely eroded areas. Horizons with value of 3 are less than 7 inches thick.  The texture is mostly silt loam or silty clay loam, but includes silty clay and clay in severely eroded areas.\nSome pedons have a transitional between the Ap and Bt horizons.  The Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 8.  The texture is silty clay or clay except the upper few inches is also silty clay loam.  Mottles are in shades of brown and red.\nThe BC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  Mottles are in shades of brown, red and gray.  The texture is silty clay or clay."

Archer soils have sandy loam to sand surface horizons and a noticeable amount of sand in the upper part of the B horizon.  Bradyville soils have Bt horizons redder than 7.5YR hue.  Braxton soils have sola more than 60 inches tkick and base saturation is less than 60 percent.  Capshaw soils have gray mottles in the middle and lower parts of the Bt horizon and base saturation of 35 to 60 percent.  Colbert soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and gray mottles in the B horizon.  Conasauga soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Hampshire soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches and base saturation of less than 60 percent. Needmore soils are mesic.  Talbott soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches and have redder hues in the Bt horizon."
