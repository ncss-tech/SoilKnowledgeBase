  "STATES": "ID,WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Marble series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits or eolian sand. Marble soils are on hummocky or dune-like terraces and have slopes of 0 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depths to diagnostic horizons or features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F. The average summer soil temperature is about 65 to 68 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry between the depths of 12 and 35 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The soil is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has weak structure and is massive or single grain. It has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and a chroma of 3 or 4, dry or moist. Texture is loamy sand, sand, loamy coarse sand or coarse sand.\nIn the E&Bt horizon, the E part comprises 90 to 95 percent of the horizon. It has value of 6 or 7 dry and a chroma of 2 to 4, dry or moist. Texture is loamy sand, sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand and has 0 to 5 percent fine gravel. The Bt part comprises 5 to 10 percent of the horizon and it has a chroma of 4 or 6, dry or moist. Total thickness of the lamellae is less than 6 inches. Texture is loamy sand, sand, loamy coarse sand or coarse sand.\nThe C horizon is variegated or has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is loamy sand, sand, loamy coarse sand or coarse sand and has 0 to 5 percent fine gravel. Lamellae may be present in the C horizon in some pedons."

The average January temperature is 27 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 68 degrees F., The mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."

The drainage class has been revised from excessively drained to well drained based on the presence of lamellae and their effect on water movement.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory data - S01-WA063-008, pedon number: 02N0119 and S68WA-063-002, Spokane County, WA; NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
