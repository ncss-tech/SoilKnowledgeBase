Muckamuck soils formed in alluvium derived in part from glacial outwash. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 11 to 17 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 22 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. The frost-free season is 100 to 125 days."
