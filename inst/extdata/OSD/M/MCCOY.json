  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a paralithic contact of weathered crystalline rock is 25 to 40 inches. The soil between a depth of about 4 and 12 inches becomes moist in some part in November or early December and remains moist until May. The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F. Organic matter content is 1 to 4 percent in the upper 20 inches and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent 25 to 30 inches below the surface. Rock fragments, mostly fine gravel, make up 1 to 15 percent of the solum.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/1,4/3, 4/2, 4/1, 3/2, 4/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2. 2.5Y 5/3. Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam. This horizon is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/4, 5/4, 3/2, 4/2, 3/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2; 5YR 3/2, 4/2; 2.5Y 5/4, 4/2. Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam with an absolute clay increase of 5 to 9 percent over the A horizon. Reaction is moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Most pedons have a B3 horizon overlying the weathered crystalline bedrock."

Arujo, and Kawenga soils have a paralithic contact of bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches below the soil surface. Botella, Chico, Elkhorn, Havala, Lockwood, Minlum, Rimtrail and saltcanyon are all deeper than 60 inches to bedrock. Sapwi soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Alumrock soils have argillic horizons that average 18 to 24 percent clay.Tongva soils are developed from andesite and basal and have MAAT of 60 to 73 degrees F."

Elevations are 400 to 2,900 feet. The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches. Average January temperature is about 49 degrees F., average July temperature is about 64 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 57 degrees to 59 degrees F. The freeze-free season is about 250 days."
