  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist and is dry between depths of 4 and 11 inches for less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  The solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more thick.  The solum is strongly acid or very strongly acid.  The umbric epipedon is from 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is silty clay or clay with 45 to 55 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or gravelly loam.  It has moderate or strong granular or very fine subangular blocky structure.  It has 0 to 25 percent gravel.  Some pedons have stones on the surface.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 dry.  It is clay or silty clay.  It has weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Astoria, Blachly, Ead, Fendall, and Gleneden series.  Astoria soils have amorphous materials in the exchange complex and have hue yellower than 5YR throughout.  Blachly soils have an ochric epipedon.  Ead and Fendall soils have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches and lack hue as red as 5YR.  Ead soils also have an epipedon thicker than 20 inches.  Gleneden soils are somewhat poorly drained and have matrix colors of 10YR or yellower."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soils formed in fine textured colluvium over fine and coarse grained, basic igneous, tuffaceous agglomerate.  The climate is humid with a mean annual precipitation of 60 to 90 inches.  The mean January temperature is 36 degrees F, the mean July temperature is 62 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 45 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 145 to 200 days."
