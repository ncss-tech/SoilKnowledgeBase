  "OVERVIEW": "The Moentria series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from calcareous sandstone and siltstone. Moentria soils are on mountains. Slope ranges from 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
