  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil typically contains 2 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Depth to carbonates ranges form 0 to 10 inches.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend from the surface to a depth of 20 to 30 inches.  The depth to soft shale ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil above the soft shale bedrock is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist.   It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.   It typically averages between 45 and 55 percent clay but ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  It has weak or moderate grades of prismatic structure parting to weak to strong subangular or angular blocky.\nThe Bk and BCk horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  They are silty clay, clay or silty clay loam and have 35 to 60 percent clay.  They contain nests of gypsum in some pedons.  Some pedons have a By horizon with properties similar to the Bk and BCk horizons.\nSome pedons have a C horizon up to 12 inches thick.  Where present, it has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam and has 35 to 60 percent clay.  It commonly has few to many gypsum crystals and carbonates disseminated or in masses.  It has an EC of 2 to 16 mmhos/cm and ESP of 4 to 12.\nThe Cr material has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is platy.  It is laminated in some pedons and massive in others.  It commonly has nests or lenses of gypsum and is moderately or strongly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Lawther and Tomty series.  These soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 40 inches.  In addition, Tomty soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a chroma of 1 in the upper 18 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICAL SETTING:  Moreau soils are on level to very steep sedimentary upland plains.  Slope gradients commonly are 2 to 5 percent, but range from 0 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in soft calcareous, alkaline shales.  The climate is cool, semiarid.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  Most of the precipitation occurs in the spring and summer."

Lawther and Savage soils are on level concave swales and terraces.  Dimyaw and Savage soils do not have a paralithic contact within 40 inches.  Wayden soils have a paralithic contact within 20 inches.  Dimyaw and Wayden soils are on crests of hills and steep slopes.  Regent soils have an argillic horizon and are on similar landscapes with Moreau soils.  Cabba, Morton, and Sen soils are on nearby uplands.  Cabba soils have bedded siltstone at shallow depths and are on steep slopes.  Morton and Sen soils are fine-silty.  Daglum and Rhoades soils have a natric horizon.  They are on nearby uplands and terraces, and are in complex with Moreau soils in some areas.  Grail soils are in nearby concave swales.  They have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick."
