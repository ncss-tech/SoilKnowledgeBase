  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F and the mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F.  The organic layers are more than 51 inches thick.  These soils are usually saturated with water unless drained.  Fibers are from grasses, sedges, and wood.  The soil in the subsurface and bottom tier is dominated by hemic material.  Rubbed fiber content ranges from 18 to 50 percent and wood content from 5 to 25 percent.  Thin layers of volcanic ash and diatomaceous earth are in some pedons.\nThe Oe horizons below the surface tier have hue of 2.5YR through 2.5Y or are neutral.  Value is 2 to 4 moist, 2 to 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 2 moist and dry.  Reaction is neutral to strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The McMurray soils are in depressional areas on glacial till and outwash plains and in abandoned glacial stream channels.  These soils formed in mixed herbaceous and woody organic material.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevation is from near sea level to 1,000 feet.  McMurray soils have a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is rare.  Average annual precipitation is 20 to 60 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 36 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 62 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 46 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 260 days.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 215 to 320 days."

Mukilteo soils are dysic, Semiahmoo soils are sapric.  Shalcar soils are less than 51 inches or organic deposits over loamy material."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most McMurray soils have been cleared and drained and are used for pasture, hayland, or cropland.  The native vegetation is western redcedar, red alder, western hemlock, Sitka spruce, and lodgepole pine with an understory of rushes, sedges, hardhack, skunkcabbage, salmonberry, trailing blackberry, willow, and devils club."
