  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the cambic horizon ranges from 25 to 45 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact with fractured igneous or metamorphic bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.   Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the soil but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Volume of angular coarse fragments increases with depth and ranges from 35 to 55 percent in the particle-size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the A horizon, from 5 to 35 percent in the Bw1 and Bw2 horizons, and from 20 to 75 percent in the Bw3, Bw4, and C horizons .  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the A horizon, from 1 to 15 percent in the Bw1 and Bw2 horizon, from 5 to 50 percent in the Bw3 and Bw4 horizons, and from 40 to 60 percent in the C horizon .  Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.  A stony phase is recognized in some places.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR , value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texturs is loamor sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of  10YR , value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has textures like the Ap or A horizon.\nThe Bw hue of 7.5YR or 10YR  and value and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs  in the upper part and grades to very gravelly, very cobbly, extremely gravell, or extremely cobbly analogs with depth.\nSome pedons have a C horizon  with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It has textures like the B horizon.\nThe R horizon is fractured igneous or metamorphic bedrock with the fractures more than 4 inches apart.  Fine earth material fills some fractures."
