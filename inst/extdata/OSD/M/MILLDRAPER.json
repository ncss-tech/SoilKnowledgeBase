Allegheny, Allenwoood, Cades (tentative), Chester, Chetwynd, Elsinboro, Frankstown, Glenelg, Happyland (tentative), Grosstown (tentative), Leck Kill, Lonon, Meadowville, Murrill, Nixon, Queponco (tentative), Reybold (tentative), Rhodhiss (tentative), Shouns, Tate, Ungers and Whiteford soils are greater than 60 inches to lithic or paralithic contact. Allegheny, Cades (tentative), Elsinboro and Nixon soils develop in alluvium. Meadowville soils develop in alluvium over residuum of basic and acidic rock. Lonon, Murrill, Shouns and Tate soils develop in colluvium. Queponco (tentative) and Reybold (tentative) soils develop in fluvio-marine sediments. Allenwood soils develop in glacial till. Chester soils develop in residuum of micaceous schist. Chetwynd soils develop in glacial outwash. Frankstown soils develop in residuum of limestone and limy shale and siltstone. Glenelg soils develop in residuum of micaceous schist. Happylans soils develop in residuum of metamonzonite, schist, gneiss, and phyllite. Leck Kill soils develop in glacial till or residuum of red shale, siltstone and sandstone. Rhodhiss (tentative) soils develop in residuum of acid crystalline rock in MLRA 136. Ungers soils develop in residuum of red sandstone and shale. Whiteford soils develop in residuum of dark colored slate. Albemarle and Eubanks soils are deep to paralithic or lithic contact. Albemarle soils develop in residuum of arkosic metasandstone. Eubanks soils develop in residuum of granodiorites. Drapermill (tentative) and Gilwood soils are moderately deep to lithic contact. Drapermill soils develop in residuum of schist and phyllite. Gilwood soils develop in residuum of siltstone. Cardova soils develop in residdum or graphitic phyllite.\nCaylor (inactive) and Naceville (inactive) are soils in a related family and may become competitors as their classification is updated to the eighth edition of soil taxonomy. Caylor (inactive)and Naceville (inactive) are very deep to lithic or paralithic contact."
