Chester soils develop in residuum of micaceous schist. Chetwynd soils develop in glacial outwash. Frankstown soils develop in residuum of limestone and limy shale and siltstone. Glenelg soils develop in residuum of micaceous schist. Happylans soils develop in residuum of metamonzonite, schist, gneiss, and phyllite. Leck Kill soils develop in glacial till or residuum of red shale, siltstone and sandstone. Rhodhiss (tentative) soils develop in residuum of acid crystalline rock in MLRA 136.
