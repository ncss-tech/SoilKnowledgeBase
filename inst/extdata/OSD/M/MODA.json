The soil is usually dry above the duripan during most summers.\nThe A horizon colors are in 10YR hues with values of 5, 6 and 7 and chromas of 3 and 4; and in 7.5YR hues with values of 5 and 6 and chromas of 4 and 6.  Moist colors are dark brown or dark yellowish brown.  Texture ranges from loam to gravelly loam; structure from weak to massive and reaction from slightly acid to medium acid.  The Bt horizon colors are in 10YR hue with values of 4, 5 and 6 and chromas of 3 and 4; and in 7.5YR hue with values of 4, 5 and 6 and chromas of 4. Moist colors have higher chromas (1 or 2 units).  Texture ranges from clay to gravelly clay; structure is moderate to strong prismatic, angular blocky or columnar; and reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Hillgate, Madera, Redding, San Joaquin and Yokohl soils.  The Hillgate soils lack duripans, and the Madera soils have light yellowish brown A horizons and lack an abrupt AB boundary.  The Redding soils are yellowish-red throughout the profile and are kaolinitic.  The San Joaquin soils have colors in 5YR hue and have a gradual transition from A to Bt horizons.  The Yokohl soils have colors in 5YR hues and have clay texture in the A horizons."

The underlying alluvium was derived from a wide variety of rock formations.  Elevations are 175 to 500 feet.  The climate is Mediterranean with mean annual rainfall of 15 to 30 inches with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., average January temperature about 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 83 degrees F."

The current classification is based on an ochric epipedon, an argillic horizon with more than 35 percent clay, an abrupt clay increase, and an indurated duripan.\nEdits made after SDJR project and typical profile edited to reflect the CA021 TUD without aggregated horizons. Vermiculitic mineralogy class is not verified with clay mineralogy lab data. - AEC\nOSED scanned by SSQA.  Last revised by state on 2/66.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
