  "OVERVIEW": "The McLennan series consists of very deep to loamy shale, siltstone, and flaggy limestone. These well drained soils formed in residuum derived from shale, claystone, or siltstone interbedded with flaggy limestone of Upper Cretaceous Age.  These gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on steep ridges on dissected plains.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 892 mm (35.1 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.6 degrees C (65.5 degrees F).",
