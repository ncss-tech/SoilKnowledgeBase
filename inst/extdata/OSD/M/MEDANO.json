  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The Medano soils are calcareous in the surface horizons but are noncalcareous below depths of 20 inches.  The particle size control section is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand, but exclude loamy very fine sands.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in a major part of the control section and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 63 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Fossum, Hamar, Hangaard, Isan, Isanti, and Venlo series.  Fossum soils are calcareous throughout and have visible accumulation of calcium carbonate in the A horizon.  Hamar, Hangaard, and Venlo series are noncalcareous in the upper part of the control section and become calcareous with increasing depth.  Isan and Isanti soils are acid throughout the control section."

The average annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 41 to 44 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 59 to 61 degrees F."
