  "STATES": "CO,ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Medano series consist of deep, poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  They are on low flood plains and the lower ends of alluvial fans with slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
