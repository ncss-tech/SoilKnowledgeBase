  "OVERVIEW": "The Majorsplace series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from quartzite with admixtures of calcareous loess. The Majorsplace soils are on backslopes of mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6.5 degrees C.",
