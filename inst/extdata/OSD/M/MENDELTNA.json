  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material consists of fibrous peat over partially decomposed moss, twigs, and root fibers 8 to 14 inches thick.  Depth to permafrost ranges from 14 to 29 inches below the surface of the mineral soil two months after the summer solstice. Texture of the control section includes loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam.  There is more than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.   Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 30 percent and includes subangular pebbles and cobbles.  Reaction throughout the mineral profile is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has moist hue of 7.5YR or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  Color striations are common due to variable organic matter content.  Texture is mucky silt loam, silt loam or silt.\nThe 2C horizon has moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles have moist hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 5GY; mottles are absent in many profiles.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent subangular gravel and cobble.  A lag concentrate of coarse fragments is common along the surface of the horizon.\nThe 2Cf horizon has moist hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; moist value of 4 or 5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.  Textures include loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam.  Clay content often increases with depth.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 30 percent and includes subangular gravel and cobble.  Effervescence is slight or none with cold dilute HCl."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mendeltna soils formed in a thick organic mat over lacustrine nearshore deposits.  They are on level to gently sloping lacustrine terraces.\nThe climate is subarctic continental with long, cold winters and short, warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 17 inches and the mean annual snowfall is 39 to 68 inches.  Mean January temperature is minus 10 degrees F., mean July temperature is 56 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature varies from 23 to 27 degrees F."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Klawasi, Tebay, and Tolsona soils.  Klawasi soils are on lower level lacustrine terraces and have clayey particle size.  Tebay soils are on glacial moraines and drumlins, have cambic horizons, and are well drained. Tolsona soils are on higher elevation glacial till plains and have sandy loam textures."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly and poorly drained.  Runoff is very slow.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the organic mat and moderate in the mineral soil.  The profile is saturated and free water occurs above the permafrost.  Altered drainage occurs where the insulating organic mat is destroyed by fire or clearing. Loss of the organic mat results in lowering of the permafrost level and subsequent lowering of the water table."

The Chetaslina series represents soils where where the permafrost and water table have dropped below the series control section due to disturbance of the organic mat.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
