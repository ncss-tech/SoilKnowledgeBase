The mean winter soil temperature varies from 34 to 36 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature varies from 60 to 62 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from May 1 to December 1.  The soils are usually saturated during the late winter and spring due to a seasonal water table at a depth of 12 to 30 inches.  The 10 to 40 inches control section is stratified loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand that when mixed, is loam or sandy loam with a weighted average of 12 to 18 percent clay, 50 to 65 percent sand and 15 to 35 percent fine sand and coarser.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 24 to 54 inches.  Depth to mottles is 0 to 35 inches.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/1, 5/1, 5/2 or N 4/0.  Moist colors is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 3/1, 3/2, or N 3/0.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.\nThe C and Cg horizon dry colors are 10YR 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2 or 5Y 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4; 2.5Y 3/1, 4/2, 5/2, 4/4, or 5Y 5/2.  Texture is stratified sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have strata of loam with 10 to 15 percent gravel.  Gley mottles of 5GY, 5G, or 5BG are at a depth of 34 to 50 inches."
