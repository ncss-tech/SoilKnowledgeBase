    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McWhinney soils are on mountain ridges and convex slope positions. Slopes are 15 to 110 percent. Elevations are 60 to 640 meters. These soils formed in residuum from Quaternary and Tertiary age siltstone and fine-grained sandstone on the Undifferentiated Wildcat Group. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C.  Frost free season is about 240 to 300 days."
