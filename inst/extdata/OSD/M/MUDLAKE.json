  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudlake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed mostly in loess or silty alluvium and in the underlying till or mud-flow sediment on moraines and drumlins.  Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle and moderate or moderately rapid in the till or mud-flow sediment.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.   Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 30 to more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the silty mantle and depth to till or mud-flow sediment range from 12 to 40 inches.  The silty mantle has more than 50 percent silt, 8 to 17 percent clay, and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the silty mantle and from 5 to 35 percent in till or mud-flow sediment.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.  Redox features are in the albic or the spodic horizon within a depth of 20 inches.  Saturation occurs within 20 inches for some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the A or Ap horizon is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. Texture is silt loam or silt.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4. Texture is silt loam.\nWhere the silty mantle is thin, some pedons have a 2Bs horizon with color like the Bs horizon described above.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with color and texture like the E horizon described above.\nWhere the silty mantle is thin, some pedons have a 2E horizon with color like the E' horizon described above.  Texture is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogs, but in some pedons, it is loamy sand or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.  In some pedons, immediately below the silty mantle, it is loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogs.\nMudlake soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation below the spodic horizon has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the extent to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination with or without a Bt horizon or a 2Bt horizon or both.\nThe E' part of the E/B or B/E horizon, has color and texture like the E' horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2E' part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon, has color and texture like the 2E' horizon described above.\nThe 2Bt part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is typically loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogs but in some pedons it is loamy sand or the gravelly analogs in the lower part.  Loam texture occurs only immediately below the silty mantle.\nThe 2Bt horizon has color and texture like the 2Bt part described above.  Clay content of the argillic material ranges from 8 to 17 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has color like the 2Bt horizon described above.  Typically, texture is sandy loam or the gravelly or cobbly analogs, but in some pedons, it is loamy sand or the gravelly or cobbly analogs or has layers with these textures."
