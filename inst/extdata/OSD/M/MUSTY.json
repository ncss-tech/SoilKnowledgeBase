The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 25 percent clay, 20 to 35 percent gravel and 15 to 35 percent cobbles.  It is moderately to strongly acid throughout.  It is 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 25 to 35 percent gravel and 20 to 35 percent cobbles.  It is very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly loam."
