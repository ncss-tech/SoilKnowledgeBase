  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A horizon and upper B horizon unless limed.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the lower horizons.   Content of rock fragments of gravel size range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the A and E horizons and 0 to 5 percent by volume in the Bt horizon.  Some pedons have as much as 45 percent cobbles and stones in the A and E horizons.  Most pedons have few to common flakes of mica in the Bt horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  The A horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam,  or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Eroded phases are sandy clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 6.  The E horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red, yellow, and brown range from none to many.  Texture is sandy clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8 or is mottled in shades of these colors.  Weathered Triassic C material is evident in this horizon.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, is multicolored or similar in color to the BC horizon.  It is saprolite weathered from Triassic sandstone, mudstone, shale, and siltstone.  Texture is variable but is typically loamy."

Albertville soils have soft bedrock within a depth of 40 to 60 inches and formed in residuum from shale.  Badin and Townley soils have soft bedrock within 20 to 40 inches.  Brockroad and Catharpin soils have lithologic discontinuity within the series control section. Coghill and Corryton soils formed in residuum from quartzose limestone and interbedded calcereous sandstone and shale.  Luverne soils formed in stratified marine sediments.  Masada and McQueen soils developed on alluvial terraces. Nason and Tatum soils formed in residuum from schist and have a depth to soft bedrock or 40 to 60 inches.  Peakin(T) soils have a seasonal high water table at a depth of 3.0 to 6.0 feet.  Sweatman soils formed in marine sediments consisting of thinly bedded clayey shales and sandy and loamy materials and have sola thickness (rock controlled structure) at less than 40 inches.  Vance soils have very firm and plastic Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mayodan soils are on gently sloping ridges and strongly sloping to steep side slopes in the Triassic areas of the southern and northern piedmont.  Slopes are commonly 3 to 12 percent and range from 1 to 50 percent.  The soils developed in residuum weathered from Triassic materials consisting of shales, sandstones, mudstones, and siltstone. Mean annual temperature near the type location is 60 degrees F., with mean annual precipitation of 45 inches."

Brickhaven(T) soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches and a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1.5 to 3.0 feet.  Carbonton(T) soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40inches and a seasonal high water table at a depth of 1.0 to 2.0 feet.  Creedmoor soils have a depth to a seaonal high water table of 1.0 to 2.0 feet and commonly are on lower lying landscapes.  Granville soils are fine-loamy. Green Level soils have a very high shrink swell potential and a depth to water table of 1.0 to 2.5 feet.  Hallison and Mooshaunee soils are fine-silty, and depth to soft bedrock is 40 to 60 inches and 20 to 40 inches respectively. Pinoka(T) soils are fine-loamy and are generally on steeper side slopes.  Polkton soils have a high shrink swell potential, have a depth to soft bedrock of 20 to 40 inches, and have a depth to a seasonal high water table of 1.5 to 2.5 feet. Wadesboro soils have rhodic colors and soft bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. White Store soils have a very high shrink swell potential, have a depth to soft bedrock of 40 to 60 inches, and have a depth to a seasonal high water table of 1.0 to 1.5 feet."
