The soil is very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the rest of the profile.  Some pedons have as much as 4 percent nodules of plinthite commonly at more than 50 inches below the surface.  Content of gravel ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the A and E horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  The middle part of the Bt of many pedons has mottles in shades of in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray.  The Bt horizon is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  Some pedons have thin layers of sandy clay loam in the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Iron accumulations in shades of red, yellow, and brown and iron or clay depletions in shades of gray range from few to many.  Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay."

Dewey, Faceville, Fullerton, Summerton, and Waynesboro soils have dominant hue of 5YR or redder in the series control section.  Henderson soils have 10 percent or more coarse fragments of chert.  Lugoff soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the upper Bt horizon.  Aycock, Carnegie, Dothan, Norfolk, and Tifton soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Caroline, Collegedale, Shubuta, and Turbeville soils have mixed mineralogy.  Esto soils are mottled in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Freemanville, Sunsweet, and Varina soils have a horizon with more than 5 percent plinthite within a depth of 60 inches."
