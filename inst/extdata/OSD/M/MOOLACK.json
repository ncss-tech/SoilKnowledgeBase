The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 60 consecutive days in the control section during the summer months.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Thickness of the ash commonly is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 4 through 6 dry.  It is sand or loamy sand.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 or 6 dry with chroma of 2 to 6 moist and dry.  It is coarse sand and gravelly coarse sand.  The range in pumice fragments is:  5 to 30 percent 2 to 5 mm in diamter, 5 to 10 percent 5 to 19 mm in diameter, and 5 to 10 percent cobble size.\nThe buried horizons below the ash is cobbly or very cobbly, medium textured colluvium or glacial till."
