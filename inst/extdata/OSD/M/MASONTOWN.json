Base saturation is more than 35 percent in part or all of the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles are in shades of these colors in many pedons.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam or their mucky analogues.  Thin strata of loamy sand or loamy fine sand are evident in some pedons.\nThe C horizon is in hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles are in shades of these colors in many pedons.  It is sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  These textures are in thin strata in some pedons.  In a few pedons, finer textural layers are in thin bands.  The control section average 10 to 18 percent clay."

Arapahoe, Ballahack, Conaby, Johnston, Muckalee, Pickney, Polawana, Torhunta, and Wasda series are in closely related families.  Arapahoe and Torhunta soils have umbric epipedons less than 24 inches thick.  In addition, Arapahoe soils have mixed mineralogy and Torhunta soils are acid.  Ballahack and Johnston soils are acid and have significantly lower base saturation.  Also Ballahack soils are fine-loamy.  Conaby and Wasda soils have histic epipedons and mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Wasda soils are fine-loamy.  Pickney and Polawana soils are sandy.  Polawana soils also have mixed mineralogy.  Muckalee soils lack umbric epipedons."
