  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 48 degrees to 53 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature from 65 degrees to 72 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days in the 4 month period following the summer solstice. Bedrock, where present, is deeper than 60 inches. The A1 horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has moderate or strong, very fine and fine granular structure. This horizon is slightly acid or neutral. The B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silty clay, sandy clay, or clay.  This horizon has moderate medium angular blocky to strong coarse prismatic structure. It has medium to thick continuous clay films on the vertical and horizontal faces of peds and has black staining on ped in the lower portion in some pedons. The B2t horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline. The Cca horizon is stratified with silt to sand. It has weakly cemented, intermittent or continuous layers between strata in some profiles. This horizon has weakly cemented, intermittent or continuous layers between strata in some profiles. This horizon is moderately or strongly calcareous, and mildly or moderately alkaline.  Noncalcareous IIC3 horizons occur in some profiles. The stratified sand of this horizon has common iron oxide mottling."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES AND THEIR DIFFERENTIAE:  These are the Banner (T), Battle Creek, Brent (T), Forsgren, Flowell, Gasset, Gem, Gemson, and Ukiah series. Banner, Brent, and Gemson soils do not have deep, wide cracks when dry. Battle Creek soils have mixed mineralogy. Forsgren soils do not have a strongly calcareous Cca horizon above depths of 40 inches. Gasset soils have over 60 percent clay in the fine earth fraction. Gem and Ukiah soils are less than 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "SETTING",
    "content": "SETTING:  The Montour soils are on rolling uplands and rounded hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 60 percent, but typically are 5 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 2,500 to 4,000 feet. The soils formed in sediments derived from coarse-grained acid igneous rocks and tuffaceous materials. The climate is mediterranean and has a frost-free period of 110 to 160 days. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 16 inches, including 1 to 5 feet of snow."
