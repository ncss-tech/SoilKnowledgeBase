  "OVERVIEW": "The Macnot series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Macnot soils are on beach terraces, inset fans, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
