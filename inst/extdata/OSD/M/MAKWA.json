Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the loamy skeletal alluvium and slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the loamy lacustrine deposits.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of  N, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 2.5, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is muck or stony muck.  Some pedons have an Oe horizon with similar colors as the Oa. Volume of rock fragments ranges from 10 to 25 percent as a weighted average. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent, volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent and volume of stones ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Texture of the mineral portion of this Oa horizon is loam.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is the very gravelly, extremely gravelly, very cobbly or extremely cobbly analogs of sandy loam, loam or silt loam. Volume of rock fragments range from 35 to 80 percent as a weighted average.
