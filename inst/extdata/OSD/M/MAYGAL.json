  "OVERVIEW": "The Maygal series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Maygal soils are on mountains.   Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Copenhaver and Nieman soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Donkehill soils have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates and are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Hogmalat soils average 35 to 55 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have more than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Layview soils have lithic contacts that are within 36 cm of the soil surface and average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Mosroc soils have less than 60 percent rock in the particle-size control section and have rock fragments that are granitic rocks.  Mountpatterson soils have mean summer soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C.  Nielsen soils are dominated by channers and have rock fragments that are sandstone or quartzite.  Notstew soils have lithic contacts that are within 36 cm of the soil surface and average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Thiefridge soils average 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, have Oi horizons, and have 4 to 10 percent organic matter in the A horizons. Slidemountain soils have an udic soil moisture regime."
