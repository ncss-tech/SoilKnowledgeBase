  "STATES": "NV,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Medburn series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately rapidly permeable soils. These soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from igneous and sedimentary rock. Medburn soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, inset fans, alluvial flats and dissected lake plains. Slope ranges 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10.5 degrees C.",
