  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Pengpong (NV), Perwick (NV) and Turbyfill (ID) series. Pengpong soils have a fine earth fraction made up dominantly of spheroidal aggregates of eolian origin and contains broken sand-sized shell fragments. Perwick soils have bedrock at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Turbyfill soils have visible secondary carbonates in the series control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Medburn soils are at elevations of 1,372 to 2,073 meters (4,500 to 6,800 feet). They are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, inset fans, alluvial flats, and dissected lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. They formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived dominantly from igneous and sedimentary rock. The climate is semiarid. Mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 12.2 degrees C. (45 to 54 degrees F.) and the mean summer temperature is 19.4 to 21.6 degrees C. (67 to 71 degrees F.) The freeze-free period is 100 to 140 days. Average annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm (8 to 12 inches)."
