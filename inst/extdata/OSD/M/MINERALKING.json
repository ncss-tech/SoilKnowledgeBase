  "OVERVIEW": "The Mineralking series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and reworked till derived from metamorphic rocks. The Mineralking soils are on glacial-valley walls and mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 865 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
