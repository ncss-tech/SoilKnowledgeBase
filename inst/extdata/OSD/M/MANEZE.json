  "OVERVIEW": "The Maneze series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone, mudstone, and siltstone. Maneze soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2410 (95 inches) millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
