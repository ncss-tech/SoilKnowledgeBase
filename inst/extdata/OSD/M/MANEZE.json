    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 1 to 46 centimeters (A horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 46 to 73 centimeters (Bw horizon).\n3. Redoximorphic features - the zone from 113 to 161 centimeters (Cg horizon).\n4. Dystroxerepts feature - base saturation less than 60 percent, by ammonium acetate, between 25 and 100 centimeters.\n5. Aquic conditions - seasonal water table, reduced matrix and aquic conditions for more than 30 days in most years within the zone from 113 to 161 centimeters\n6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 26 to 101 centimeters, averages 28 percent clay, by field estimate, and 43 percent rock fragments, by volume. CEC/clay ratio averages 0.60.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NASIS User Pedon ID: 83CA605REDW029\nSoil sample 83-RNP-9 and 86-RNP-8 were collected from this pedon and analyzed chemically at the Oregon State University Soil Testing Laboratory (Lab numbers 71712-71714, 82918 and 82919). Bulk density and moisture retention were determined at Humboldt State University.\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
