All these soils have hue of 10YR or yellower in the major portion of the series particle-size control sections. In addition Hessing, Koyen, Quima, and Wall soils have calcic horizons and/or visible carbonates. The Unionville soils have paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. In addition, Hessing, Koyen, Quima, and Unionville soils are in the Great Basin Desert (MLRAs 24, 27, 28A, 28B, 29), have precipitation more evenly distributed throughout the year, and are moist in the soil moisture control section in winter and early spring and 10 to 20 days from July through October."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Monue soils are on stream terraces, fan terraces, fan remnants, eolian deposits on structural benches at elevations of 3,820 to 6,500 feet (1,164 to 1981 meters). Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. These soils formed in eolian deposits and alluvium from sandstone. Mean annual air temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F (11 to 14 degrees C) and mean summer air temperature is 72 to 78 degrees F (22 to 26 degrees C). The average annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches (127 to 254 mm). Precipitation is distributed evenly throughout the year with a slight bulge between July and October. The driest months are April, May, and June. The freeze-free period is about 100 to 195 days."
