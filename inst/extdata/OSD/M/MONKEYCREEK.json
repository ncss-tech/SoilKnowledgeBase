  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Monkeycreek soils are on alluvial fans, benches, and footslopes.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 3,400 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  They formed in coarse-textured residuum and colluvium derived from exfoliating basalt with an influence of ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., the mean July temperature is about 70 degrees F., and the mean January temperature is about 31 degrees F.  The frost free period is 80 to 120 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Exfo, Gwin, Ninetysix, Rockly, Threecreeks, and Wolot soils.  Exfo and Ninetysix soils were formed in massive, exfoliating basalt.  Exfo soils are very shallow to bedrock, sandy-skeletal, and are found on shoulders.  Ninetysix soils are loamy-skeletal, lack an O horizon, and are found on foot slopes.  Gwin and Rockly soils were formed in hard, columnar basalt and are located immediately above the massive, exfoliating basalt.   Gwin and Rockly are loamy-skeletal and are shallow and very shallow, respectfully, to bedrock.  Threecreeks soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depth, a sandy substratum, are moderately well drained, and are on flood plains.  Wolot soils are ashy over loamy and are on alluvial fans or footslopes."
