  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are permanently submerged or exposed only during spring low tides. Gravel content is 0 through 5 percent throughout the profile. Shell content is 0 through 5 percent throughout the profile. Consistence is nonfluid throughout. All horizons have a pH of neutral through strongly alkaline and an oxidized pH of extremely acid through moderately alkaline. Soil has a 5:1 salinity greater than 0.2 dS/m throughout the profile. After drying, it is common for many of these soils to develop 5Y 5/4 mottles throughout the matrix.\nThe Cg  horizons have hue of 10Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2.5 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2. Textures range from fine sand through sand.\nThe CA or AC horizons have hue of 10Y, 5Y, 10GY, or is neutral, value of 3 through 4, and chroma of 0 or 1.Textures range from loamy fine sand through sand.\nSome pedons have multiple buried horizon sequences representing multiple buried surfaces through time. The Ab and A'b horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2.5 through 6, and chroma of 0 or 1. Textures range from loamy fine sand through sand."

Pishagqua soils are found on low energy lagoon bottoms and have greater than 100 cm of highly fluid, sulfidic, silt loam at the soil surface. Nagunt soils are found on washover fan flats and slopes in coastal lagoons and contain sulfidic materials within 100 cm of the soil surface. Napatree and Anguilla soils are on submerged headlands and submerged mainland beaches and have a lithologic discontinuity within 100 cm of the soil surface."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This subaqueous series is being proposed in areas previously mapped as water in the Rhode Island and Connecticut Soil Surveys.\nDiagnostic horizons and features in this pedon include:\n1. Peraquic feature - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 0.6 m of water at the time of coring).\n2. Reduced conditions - the zone from 0 to 195 cm.\n3. Fluventic Feature - An irregular decrease in organic carbon from a depth of 25 cm to a depth of 125 cm.\n4. Particle-size control section - zone from 25 to 100 cm (Cg2, Cg3, Cg4, and CA horizons).\n5. Psammowassents - less than 35 percent (by volume) rock fragments and a texture class of loamy fine sand or coarser in all layers within the particle-size control section.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon sample RI009-2006-013-QP in Washington County, Rhode Island, by University of Rhode Island.  Additional pedons used to determine ranges include RI009-2009-002-QP, RI009-2009-001-QP, RI009-2009-007-PJ, and RI009-2007-010-PJ (Sampled by the University of Rhode Island).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
