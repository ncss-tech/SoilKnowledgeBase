  "OVERVIEW": "The Massapog series consists of very deep, subaqueous soils permanently submerged beneath 10 through 150 cm of tidal estuarine water on flood tidal delta flats in coastal lagoons and bays. Massapog soils are formed in sandy marine and estuarine sediments transported by flood tidal currents. Slope ranges from 0 through 2 percent, mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm.",

All horizons have a pH of neutral through strongly alkaline and an oxidized pH of extremely acid through moderately alkaline. Soil has a 5:1 salinity greater than 0.2 dS/m throughout the profile. After drying, it is common for many of these soils to develop 5Y 5/4 mottles throughout the matrix.\nThe Cg  horizons have hue of 10Y, 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2.5 through 7, and chroma of 0 through 2. Textures range from fine sand through sand.\nThe CA or AC horizons have hue of 10Y, 5Y, 10GY, or is neutral, value of 3 through 4, and chroma of 0 or 1.Textures range from loamy fine sand through sand.\nSome pedons have multiple buried horizon sequences representing multiple buried surfaces through time.

Peraquic feature - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 0.6 m of water at the time of coring).\n2. Reduced conditions - the zone from 0 to 195 cm.\n3. Fluventic Feature - An irregular decrease in organic carbon from a depth of 25 cm to a depth of 125 cm.\n4. Particle-size control section - zone from 25 to 100 cm (Cg2, Cg3, Cg4, and CA horizons).\n5. Psammowassents - less than 35 percent (by volume) rock fragments and a texture class of loamy fine sand or coarser in all layers within the particle-size control section."
