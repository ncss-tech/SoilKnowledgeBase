  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 60 inches thick.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 16 to 34 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, except the surface layer in areas that have been limed.  In some pedons brown and black concretions range from few to many in all horizons.\nThe A horizon commonly has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2; and, mottles commonly are few to many in shades of gray or brown.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.  The particle size control section, from a depth of 10 inches to the top of the fragipan, has 8 to 18 percent clay and more than 32 percent silt.\nThe Btx horizon is mottled in shades of gray and brown, or it has a matrix in hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 or hue of 2.5 Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2, with mottles in shades of gray and brown.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Toisnot is the only other series in the same family.  Closely related series include the Atmore, Guthrie, Henry, Myatt, Smithton, Stough, and Trebloc series.  Toisnot soils have less silt or very fine sand in all horizons and less clay in the fragipan.  Atmore soils have more than 5 percent plinthite and do not have fragipan.  Guthrie soils have a fine-silty particle size class.  Henry soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent and have a coarse-silty particle size class.  Myatt, Smithton, and Trebloc soils do not have a fragipan.  Stough soils are somewhat poorly drained and are brittle and compact in less than 55 percent of the volume of the lower part of the subsoil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mashulaville soils are on broad flats and in depressions on stream terraces and uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  These are nearly level to very gently sloping soils that formed in loamy sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees Fahrenheit and the mean annual precipitation is about 59 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Myatt, Smithton, and Stough series of the competing series and the Bibb, Mantachie, Prentiss, and Savannah soils.  Poorly drained Myatt and Smithton soils are in similar positions as the Mashulaville soils.  Somewhat poorly drained Stough soils are in slightly higher positions.  Poorly drained Bibb and somewhat poorly drained Mantachie soils, which do not have a diagnostic subsurface horizon, are in lower positions on flood plains.  The moderately well drained Prentiss and Savannah soils, which have browner colors, are in higher positions on terraces and uplands."
