  "OVERVIEW": "The Mento series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on uplands.  They formed in loess over chalky limestone which is at depths of 40 to 72 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 54 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 23 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 46 inches.  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  Depth to chalky limestone ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  The B and C horizons contain between 5 and 15 percent exchangeable sodium.  In a few pedons the conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 4 to 8 millimhos per centimeter below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It commonly is silt loam and less commonly silty clay loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Some pedons have gray silt coating on surfaces of peds in the lower 1 to 3 inches of the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  Sand and gravel material is mostly chalk or limestone fragments."

All of these soils except Wood River soils lack concentrations of exchangeable sodium in the solum.  In addition, the Beadle and Raber soils contain more sand and formed in glacial till; the Carlson and Harney soils lack an abrupt boundary between the A and Bt horizons; Reliance soils have a lower mean annual temperature; the Spearville soils contain more clay in the argillic horizon.  Richfield soils are in a drier climate.  Wood River soils have a natric horizon and are leached of free carbonates to greater depths."
