  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mooers series consists of very deep, moderately well drained sandy soils that formed on glacial lake plains, outwash plains and terraces, stream terraces, and beach deposits. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high throughout the mineral soil. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 34 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 22 to 55 inches. Depth to carbonates is greater than 50 inches. Redoximorphic features consisting of masses of iron accumulation occur between 18 and 30 inches of the soil surface. Redoximorphic depletions may also be present, but are restricted to below 40 inches from the soil surface. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments are typically absent, but may range up to 2 percent by volume in the lower subsoil and substratum. Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the surface, and from moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the subsoil and substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. The A horizon is 2 to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Faint to prominent redoximorphic concentrations occur between 18 and 30 inches. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or it is single grain. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. It typically has faint to prominent redoximorphic concentrations or depletions. Texture is sand or fine sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak subangular blocky or it is single grain.\nThe C, 2C, and 3C, if present, horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. They typically have faint to prominent redoximorphic concentrations or depletions. Texture is sand, fine sand or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction; but 2C horizons can have loamy very fine sand or silt loam textures below a depth of 40 inches. It is massive, with or without plate-like divisions, or single grain."

Crex, Tourtillotte, and Wurtsmith soils are more than 15 percent less productive due to climatic differences. Duck (T) and Sunia soils have a loamy mantle. Lenroot soils have over 15 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Pelkie soils formed on floodplains and have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth. Seulchoix (T) soils do not have a description on file to compete. Sissabagama soils have lamellae."

Croghan, Deerfield, Flackville, Kalurah and Coveytown soils are also associated. Croghan soils are on identical landscapes but have spodic horizon development. Deerfield soils occur along the frigid-mesic boundary. Flackville soils are on similar landscapes but have clayey substrata within a 20 to 40 inch depth. Kalurah soils are loamy till soil on slightly higher ridges. Coveytown soils occur near the toe of glacial lake beach ridges where sands are underlain by loamy deposits."
