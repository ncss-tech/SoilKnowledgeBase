It has 5 to 15 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Solum thickness and depth to the lithologic discontinuity is 15 to 28 inches. Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 15 to 35 percent in the upper part and 35 to 85 percent in the lower part with an average of 45 to 85 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist. Texture is gravelly fine sandy loam, stony sand loam, cobbly sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam. It has 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw and 2C1horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam and can be gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly. The Bw has 15 to 35 percent rock fragments and the 2C1 has 35 to 80 percent. Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C2 horizon is multicolored also ranging to hue, value, and chroma similar to the 2C1 horizon.  Texture is coarse sand or loamy sand and is very gravelly, very cobbly or extremely gravelly. Some pedons have lime and silica coatings on the underside of gravel and cobbles. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on terraces at elevations of 600 to 1,300 feet. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in glacial outwash material derived mainly for quartz-bearing and basaltic rocks with a loess admixture in the A and Bw horizons. The climate is semiarid; summers are hot and dry, and winters are cold and moist. The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches. The mean January temperature is 28 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 74 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free season is 135 to 200 days."
