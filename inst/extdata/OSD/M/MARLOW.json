  "OVERVIEW": "The Marlow series consists of well drained soils that formed in loamy lodgment till on hills and mountains in glaciated uplands. They are moderately deep to a dense substratum and very deep to bedrock. Estimated saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the solum, and moderately high or moderately low in the dense substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1180 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mineral solum and depth to densic materials from the mineral surface range from 50 to 100 cm. Depth to bedrock is greater than 165 cm. Rock fragments are dominantly gravel with some cobbles and stones, and range from 5 to 35 percent throughout the solum and up to 40 percent in the substratum. The silt content in the solum and underlying till averages less than 50 percent, but ranges to 50 percent or more in the upper 25 cm of the solum. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe O horizons, where present, consist of slightly, moderately, and/or highly decomposed organic material.\nThe A horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4. Texture is dominantly fine sandy loam or loam, but includes very fine sandy loam and silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have an Ap horizon that has colors and textures similar to the A horizon.\nThe E horizon, where present, is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is dominantly fine sandy loam or loam, but includes very fine sandy loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon up to 10 cm thick that has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.\nTexture of the B and BC horizons is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have a friable C horizon up to 20 cm thick that has color and texture similar to the underlying Cd layer.\nThe Cd layer has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. It is massive or has plates of geogenic origin. Consistence is firm or very firm. Loose or friable segregated sand lenses with a horizontal orientation compose up to 20 percent of the densic materials. The lenses are typically coarse, medium, or fine sand ranging from 2 to 25 mm thick."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marlow soils are on nearly level to steep slopes in glaciated uplands. They are typically on convex backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes. The soils formed in loamy lodgment till derived mainly from schist, gneiss, phyllite, and granite. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 790 to 1640 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 2 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from about 2 to 800 meters above sea level."

Berkshire, Monadnock, Sunapee, and Tunbridge soils formed in supraglacial till and do not have a dense substratum. In addition, Tunbridge soils are moderately deep to bedrock. Marlow soils are in a drainage sequence with the moderately well drained Peru soils, somewhat poorly drained Colonel soils, somewhat poorly and poorly drained Pillsbury soils, and very poorly drained Peacham soils."
