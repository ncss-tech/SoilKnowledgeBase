  "OVERVIEW": "The Maho Bay series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils on summits and side slopes of volcanic hills and mountains.  They formed in material weathered from extrusive volcanic residuum.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 80 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Slopes range from 12 to 90 percent.",

Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the A horizon, and very strongly acid to slightly acid in the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Content of pebbles and cobbles ranges from 0 to 30 percent, by volume.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.

All of these soils are on similar positions of volcanic uplands.  In addition, Annaberg soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Cramer soils are clayey.  Dorothea, Fredriksdal, and Susannaberg soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have vermiculitic clay mineralogy.  Southgate soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and do not have a Mollic epipedon.  Victory soils are moderately deep to bedrock and do not have a mollic epipedon."
