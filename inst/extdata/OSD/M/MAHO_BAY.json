All of these soils are on similar positions of volcanic uplands.  In addition, Annaberg soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections.  Cramer soils are clayey.  Dorothea, Fredriksdal, and Susannaberg soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and have vermiculitic clay mineralogy.  Southgate soils have loamy-skeletal particle-size control sections and do not have a Mollic epipedon.  Victory soils are moderately deep to bedrock and do not have a mollic epipedon."
