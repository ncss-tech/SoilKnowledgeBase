This soil is usually moist in all parts of the moisture control for at least 45 consecutive days in the spring, and is usually dry in late summer and autumn.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically has granular primary structure but has very fine and fine subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  The C horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 3 through 6 moist and chroma of 0 through 2.  Mottles are 30 to 60 inches deep."
