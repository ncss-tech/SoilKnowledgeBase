  "STATES": "AZ,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Metuck series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils on canyon escarpments of mesas and plateaus.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium overlying residuum derived dominantly from calcareous sedimentary rock.  Slope is 15 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
