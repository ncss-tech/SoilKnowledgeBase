  "OVERVIEW": "The Merden series consists of very deep, poorly or somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on low terraces and flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to the seasonal high water table ranges from 10 to 20 inches. These soils are calcareous throughout.  The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section is typically loam or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have lenses of fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  It averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 10 to 50 percent silt, and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser but less than 50 percent total sand.  The E.C. is typically less than 4 but ranges to 8 in some pedons. The E.S.P. is typically less than 10 but ranges to 15 in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is  fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Organic carbon content is greater than 0.3 percent between 10 and 50 inches.  Redoximorphic features are common in some pedons.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
