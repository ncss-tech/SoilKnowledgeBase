    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the lithic contact ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F.  The argillic horizon commonly rests directly on the bedrock, but a 2 - Middlewood Series\nthin C horizon is in some pedons.  Rock fragments commonly are less than 15 percent but range from 0 to 35 percent hard, phyllitic shale channers.  EC is 0 to 2 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is clay, channery clay, clay loam or channery clay loam with 35 to 60 percent clay and up to 40 percent silt.  It is slightly acid through mildly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Middlewood soils are on bedrock-controlled hillslopes, ridges, upper pediments, and dipslopes.  They formed in noncalcareous residuum and colluvial slopewash derived from hard, phyllitic shale.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  Elevations are 6,500 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 14 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 80 to 110 days."
