  "OVERVIEW": "The Madelia series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous silty lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains and moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 inches),",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates range from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). The mollic epipedon ranges from 36 to 61 cm (14 to 24 inches) in thickness. Typically the series control section averages between 22 and 30 percent clay with an extreme range of 18 to 35 percent and from 3 to 15 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It typically is a silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe B horizon has a hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 1 or 2 or a hue of 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BC or C horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam high in content of very fine sand. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline with free carbonates throughout, but in some pedons its upper 30 cm (12 inches) or less are slightly alkaline and lack free carbonates. A loam 2C horizon of glacial till begins at depths as shallow as 102 cm (40 inches) in a some pedons."

Chalmers and Dolbee do not have free carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Drummer soils have thicker sola and a 10YR hue in the lower B horizon and C horizons. Elvira soils have concentrations of Fe and Mn oxides in the A and B horizons. Garwin soils have a lower content of sand in the sola, prismatic structure in the lower B horizons and in the upper C horizons and in addition lack free carbonates above depths of (102 cm) 40 inches. Hartsburg soils have a lower content of sand and lime concretions in the B2 horizon. Wacousta soils have thinner sola. Marcus soils have finer textured A and upper B horizons. Maxcreek, Maxfield and Rushmore soils have a loamy 2C horizon of glacial till beginning within depths of 102 cm (40 inches). Ossian soils have thicker sola and free carbonates at a greater depth. Patton and Pella soils typically have a 10YR hue in the B horizon and loamy till or outwash 2C horizons at depths of about 102 cm (40 inches). Sable soils contain less sand and have thicker sola."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane to slightly concave slopes. They are on level to gently undulating lake plains or ground moraines that are mantled with lacustrine sediments. Slope gradient is 0 to 2 percent. They have formed in silty lacustrine sediments of late Wisconsinan Age. . Mean annual air temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is 686 to 813 mm (27 to 32 inches). Frost free days range form 155 to 200 days. Elevation above sea level ranges from 242 to 427 m (800 to 1400 feet)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These include the Kingston, Spicer, and Truman soils. Kingston soils are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained and the Truman soils are well drained and are on higher lying or more sloping terrain. The very poorly and poorly drained calcareous Spicer soils are in nearby depressions and low rises. These soils developed in materials that are similar to those of the Madelia soils and are members of a hydrosequence with the Madelia soils."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second (.6 to 2 inches per hour).
