  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mawae soils are on upper elevation, leeward slopes of Hualalai and Mauna Loa volcanoes at an elevation from 1067 to 2134 meters (3500 to 7000 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope components of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to hilly `a`a lava flows that are 1,500 to 3,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed mainly in organic material consisting of decomposed leaves, twigs, and wood; and to a lesser degree basic volcanic ash and weathered lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 1780 millimeters (40 to 70 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 12 to 14 degrees C (53 to 57 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
