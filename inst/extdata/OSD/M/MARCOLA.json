  "OVERVIEW": "The Marcola series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from mixed sedimentary and volcanic rock.  These soils are on fans and have slopes of 2 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is 52 degrees F.",

The soil is usually moist but is dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 50 to 60 consecutive days during the summer in most years.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 1 or 2.  It is cobbly or gravelly silty clay loam with 25 to 35 percent coarse fragments.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5 or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Dry value of 6 and chroma of 4 occur below 20 inches.  It is very gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly clay.  It averages 40 to 50 percent clay, 15 to 40 percent gravel and 20 to 45 percent cobbles."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dixonville and Skookum series.  Dixonville soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Skookum soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING.  Marcola soils generally are on gently sloping fans at the mouths of steep canyons around the margins of valleys at elevations ranging from 400 to 1,200 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 7 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium and colluvium weathered from mixed sedimentary and volcanic rock sources.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 67 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 165 to 210 days."

Abiqua, McAlpin, and Waldo soils do not have an argillic horizon, have less than 35 percent rock fragments, and are well, moderately well, and poorly drained respectively.  Hazelair soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, and contain less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Philomath soils are less than 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact."
