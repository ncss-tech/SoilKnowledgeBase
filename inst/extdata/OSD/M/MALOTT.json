These soils are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches more than half the time when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to a duripan ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 23 to 43 inches.  The particle-size control section is 5 to 30 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Some pedons have stony surface.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 through 4 moist.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, and is gravelly or cobbly in some pedons.  This horizon is 0 to 15 percent pebbles, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 2 percent stones.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam and is gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly.  This horizon has 10 to 30 percent pebbles, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry, 2 or 3 moist.

Era soils have 10 to 25 percent pumice throughout the solum.  Farrell soils have less than 0 percent rock fragments in all parts of the particle-size control section.  Tonasket soils have laminated lacustrine sediments at a depth of 25 to 36 inches.  Tickason soils are calcareous at a depth of 0 to 20 inches and have a calcic horizon at 12 to 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Malott soils are on till plains and glaciated hills.  These soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of loess.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  Elevations range from 800 to 2,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 74 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 180 days."
