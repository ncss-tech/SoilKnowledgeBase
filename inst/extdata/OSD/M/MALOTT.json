  "OVERVIEW": "The Malott series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till with a mantle of loess .  These soils are on till plains and glaciated hills.  Slopes are 0 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
