  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudray series consists of moderately well drained soils that are shallow or very shallow to sodic shale.  The soils formed in slopewash alluvium weathered from sodic shale and interbedded fine grained sandstone.  Mudray soils are on fan aprons, hill toeslopes, and backslopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 6 to 20 inches.  These soils are typically calcareous throughout due to recharge of the surface but are leached a few inches in some pedons.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  The particle size control section averages clay, silty clay, or heavy clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay.  Soft shale and sandstone fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the whole soil.  EC is less than 4 mmhos throughout.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5Y through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline (pH 7.8) through very strongly alkaline (pH 9.6).  An A horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 5Y through 2.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is typically clay, silty clay, or heavy clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay, 5 to 45 percent silt, and 15 to 55 percent sand.  Reaction is very strongly alkaline.  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 15 to 35.\nThe Bnky horizon has hue of 5Y through 2.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Carbonates are segregated and range from 4 to 14 percent.  ESP ranges from 12 to 30 percent.  Reaction is very strongly alkaline.  Gypsum crystals are present in most pedons.\nThe paralithic contact is at the upper boundary of the Cr horizon.  The bedrock consists of sodium saturated shales interbedded with thin strata of sandstone or siltstone.  The\nupper few inches may be displaced due to frost action."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mudray soils are on rock-controlled alluvial fan aprons, hill toeslopes, and backslopes.  These soils formed in upslope alluvium weathered from sodic shale.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 5,200 to 6,300 feet.  The climate is cool, semiarid with moist springs and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and ranges from 5 to 9 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F.  Estimated frost-free season is about 110 to 135 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."
