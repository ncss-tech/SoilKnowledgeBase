  "OVERVIEW": "The McConnel series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits or alluvium.  McConnel soils are on inset fans, fan aprons, beach plains, beach terraces, lake terraces, fan skirts, drainage channels, barrier bars, and offshore bars.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
