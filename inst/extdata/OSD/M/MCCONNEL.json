  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Broncho, Malaga, McNye, McWatt, and Ragnel series.\nBroncho soils have calcareous Bw horizons and have more than 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the Bk horizons.  Malaga soils do not have Bk horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates.  McNye and McWatt soils are deep to lithic contacts.  Ragnel soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative in the summer due to convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McConnel soils are on inset fans, fan aprons, drainage channels, fan skirts, beach terraces, beach plains, barrier bars, lake terraces and offshore bars. These soils formed in two parent materials; the upper part is alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess and volcanic ash; the lower part is lacustrine deposits or alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,950 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 130 days."

The principal crops are alfalfa, potatoes, and small grains.  Some areas are used as a source of gravel and sand.  The native vegetation is mainly Wyoming big sagebrush, bottlebrush squirreltail, and annuals."

High volcanic glass content in the upper horizons in this pedon bears further study about extent and amount of ash content in the series in Humboldt County, NV.\nPrevious authors and editors include: SES-TM-RLB.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
