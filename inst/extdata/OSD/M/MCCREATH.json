  "OVERVIEW": "The McCreath series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess overlying glacial till. The McCreath soils are on broad, nearly level to convex upland areas with little dissection on till plains and on treads and risers on stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 685 millimeters (27 inches).",

Based on MLRA correlation, soils that have 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess over glacial till will be correlated to this series. Soils that have more than 150 centimeters (60 inches) of loess will be correlated to the Primghar series."
