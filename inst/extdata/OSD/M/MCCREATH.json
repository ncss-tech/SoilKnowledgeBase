    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nMollic epipedon - zone from the surface to a depth of approximately 43 centimeters (17 inches) (Ap, A1, and A2 horizons);\nCambic horizon - zone from approximately 43 to 89 centimeters (17 to 35 inches) (Bw1, Bw2);\nCalcic horizon - zone from 89 to 112 centimeters (35 to 44 inches) (Bk horizon);\nAquic moisture regime.\nThis soil was previously included in the Primghar series. Based on MLRA correlation, soils that have 100 to 150 centimeters (40 to 60 inches) of loess over glacial till will be correlated to this series. Soils that have more than 150 centimeters (60 inches) of loess will be correlated to the Primghar series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
