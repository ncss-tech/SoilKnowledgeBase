  "OVERVIEW": "The Montborne series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till, slope alluvium, and colluvium high in phyllite with an admixture of volcanic ash.  Montborne soils are on glaciated mountain sides and foothills.  Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 75 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
