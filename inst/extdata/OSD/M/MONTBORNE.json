  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Montborne soils are on glacially modified mountain sides and foothills.  Slopes range from 3 to 65 percent.  Elevation is 1,200 to 2,200 feet.  These soils formed in glacial till high in phyllite with an admixture of slope alluvium and colluvium containing volcanic ash.  The average annual precipitation is 70 to 80 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  Average January temperature is about 33 degrees F.; and the average July temperature is about 59 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 140 days."
