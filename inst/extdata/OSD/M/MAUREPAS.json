Rubbed fiber content is less than 10 percent. Salinity is nonsaline to slightly saline.\nReaction--Moderately acid to moderately alkaline\nThickness--24 inches\nBottom tier of the Oa horizon:\nColor--Hue of 7.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 4 or less.\nTexture--Muck; thin lenses or layers of very fluid gleyed clay are within the bottom tier below a depth of 51 inches in some pedons.\nOther features--Less than 10 percent fibers after rubbing, but some pedons have thin layers that contain more fibers. Fibers are dominantly woody, but some pedons have as much as 45 percent herbaceous fiber in the 0 to 51 inch control section. The organic layers contain between 15 and 45 percent mineral matter. Logs, dominantly cypress, and wood fragments in varying states of decomposition, are commonly throughout the organic material. Salinity is nonsaline to slightly saline.\nReaction--Moderately acid to moderately alkaline\nThickness--15 to more than 40 inches\nCg horizon:    (where present)\nColor--Hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1, or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6.\nRedoximorphic features--Gleyed matrix; iron accumulations in shades of brown or olive range from none to common in the upper part.\nTexture--Clay or mucky clay\nOther features--Slightly fluid to very fluid manner of failure. Thin layers of peat or muck and/or layers of wood, logs, and stumps are present in some pedons.\nReaction--Neutral to moderately alkaline"

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lafitte, Terra Ceia, Timbalier, and Torry series in the same family, and the Hobonny series in a closely related family. Lafitte soils contain dominantly herbaceous fiber and have SAR more than 13 or ESP more than 15 in more than half of the subsurface tier. Terra Ceia soils contain dominantly herbaceous fiber, and the organic layers typically are underlain by more sandy or loamy mineral soil materials, shell fragments, or limestone. Timbalier soils are on areas of tidal marsh, contain mainly herbaceous fiber, and are more saline. Torry soils contain dominantly herbaceous fiber, and the organic layers are underlain by limestone within a depth of 80 inches. Hobonny soils are in a thermic temperature regime."

The soils formed mainly in woody plant remains mixed with a small amount of mineral soil matter. The climate is humid and subtropical. Mean annual precipitation is about 64 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F. near the type location."

Allemands soils are on the landward side of coastal freshwater marshes and have less than 51 inches of organic material over mineral layers. Barbary and Gentilly soils are clayey mineral soils with an organic surface layer less than 16 inches thick. Carlin soils are on freshwater coastal marshes and have a water layer more than 6 inches thick within the control section. Everglades and Okeechobee soils formed mainly in herbaceous material and are more fibrous. Kenner soils are on freshwater to saline marshes and have thin mineral strata within 51 inches of the surface."

The soil is saturated in all layers throughout the year, unless artificially drained. Internal drainage is very slow to none. Runoff is negligible. Permeability is rapid. The soils are frequently to very frequently flooded for long to very long durations."
