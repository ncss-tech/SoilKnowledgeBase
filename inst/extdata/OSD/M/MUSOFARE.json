  "OVERVIEW": "The Musofare series consists of moderately deep over sandstone bedrock, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from diorite, andesite, shale, siltstone and sandstone and are on mesas, cuestas, knolls and intrusive dikes. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
