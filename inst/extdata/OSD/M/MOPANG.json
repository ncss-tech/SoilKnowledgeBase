  "OVERVIEW": "The Mopang series consists of deep to cemented till, well or moderately well drained soils that formed in glaciofluvial sediments. These soils are on outwash terraces on till plains and have slopes of 5 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 90 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
