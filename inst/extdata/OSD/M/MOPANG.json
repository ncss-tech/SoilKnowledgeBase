Elevation ranges from near sea level to 1,000 feet. They are in a humid marine climate with cool, wet winter and cool, moist summers. The annual precipitation ranges from 80 to 175 inches. The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 140 to 220 days."

The mesic counterpart of this series (Mopang) is the Hoquiam series.\n- Ochric epipedon\n- Cambic horizon - 10 to 55 inches\n- Organic carbon is less than 4 percent below 20 inches.\n- Andic soil properties - 4 to 47 inches\n- All depths to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral horizon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska; data is available on the soil: Sample Number S78WA-27-2. Depth sampled are 8 to 15 inches, 25 to 30 inches and 38 to 42 inches. Sample Number S98WA-027-004 is complete characterization.
