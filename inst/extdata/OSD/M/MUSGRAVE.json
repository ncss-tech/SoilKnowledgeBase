  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Musgrave soils are on scarps and erosional uplands that are warmer and drier than the surrounding landscapes.   The scarps are located between Pleistocene pediments and stream terraces and Holocene alluvial flats and floodplains.  Slopes are convex and gradients range from 1 to 30 percent.  The soil formed in residuum derived from tuffs of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches, with most occurring from July through September.  Mean annual air temperature is 68 to 76 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 220 to 280 days, and elevation is 2,020 to 5,000 feet."

Borunda soils are moderately deep to weathered tuff, have calcic and gypsic horizons.  Paisano soils have petrocalcic horizons, and are on gently undulating pediments. Reduff and Scotal soils are very shallow and shallow to a lithic contact with unweathered tuff bedrock. Rockpens soils are very deep soils with cambic horizons and are on adjacent stream terraces.  Straddlebug soils are very deep, loamy soils that are on lower alluvial flats and floodplains, and formed in zeolitic alluvium derived from tuffaceous materials"
