    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The particles less than 2mm. in diameter in the control section average loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent, and they are mainly flagstones with smaller amounts of channers.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10R, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It contains clay lamellae 1/16 to 1/4 inch in thickness, but the combined thickness of the lamellae is less than 6 inches.  Flat surfaces of rock fragments have patches of clay coatings.  The fine earth fraction when mixed is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  This horizon is slightly acid or moderately acid."
