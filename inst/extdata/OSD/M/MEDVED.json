  "OVERVIEW": "The Medved series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from metasedimentary rocks. Medved soils are on rock pediments. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C.",
