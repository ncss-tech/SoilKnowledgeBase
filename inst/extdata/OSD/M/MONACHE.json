The soil between depths of about 8 and 29 inches usually becomes moist in all parts in November and remains moist until mid-July.  It is dry in all parts the rest of the year.  The watertable in the spring is usually below 5 feet, but may fluctuate to 3 or 4 feet.  Faint mottles occur below 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 degrees to 43 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 65 degrees F.  The soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F. between mid-April and mid-October.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral.  Organic carbon content is assumed to be greater than 0.5 percent to a depth of 1.25 m from the soil surface.  It is greater than 0.6 throughout the upper 50 cm.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, or 5/3, and moist color of 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.
