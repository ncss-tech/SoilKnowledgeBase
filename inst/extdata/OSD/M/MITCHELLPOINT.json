These soils ae usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of the volcanic ash mantle ranges from 14 to 20 inches.  Depth to the 3C horizon is 23 to 35 inches.  The upper part of the 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.95 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The lower part of the particle-size control section has 18 to 27 percent clay.   Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It contains 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe 2B/E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma o 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam, loam, or silt loam and may be gravelly or cobbly.  It is 0 to 20 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Some pedons have a 2E/B horizon.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam and may be gravelly or cobbly.  It is 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 5 to 15 percent pebbles.\nThe 3C horizon commonly is stratified loamy coarse sand and coarse sand, and is very gravelly or very cobbly.  Some subhorizons may be gravelly or extremely gravelly.  It has 0 to 5 percent stones, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 30 to 55 percent pebbles."

These soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits over glacial outwash with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 17 to 19 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."

The description reflects a change in classification from ashy over loamy, mixed, mesic Alfic Vitrixerands to ashy over loamy, ansio, glassy over mixed, superactive, mesic Alfic Vitrixerands.  The 0 to 40 inch particle-size control section has 3 contrasting particle-sizes; ashy over loamy over sandy-skeletal.  Ashy over loamy is used to provide the most useful interpretations.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
