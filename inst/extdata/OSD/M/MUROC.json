  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a duripan is 8 to 20 inches.  The duripan overlies granitic rock.  The mean soil temperature is 62 to 72 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is not below 47 degrees F.  at any time.  The soil is usually dry and is not continuously moist for as long as 60 days.  Dominant texture throughout the sola is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Gravel fragments, less than 10 mm in diameter, are present in volumes up to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has colors of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/4, 6/3 dry and 10YR 4/3, 4/4 moist.\nThe Bqk horizon has colors of 10YR 7/4, 8/1, 8/2, 8/3, 8/4 dry and 10YR 6/2, 6/4, 7/2 moist. In some pedons the duripan occurs as several hard laminar horizontal bands separated by an inch or two of calcareous sandy material.  These bands are not continuous.  The duripan becomes softer with increasing depth.\nThe Crkq horizon has colors of 10YR 7/3, 8/2, 8/3 dry and 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3 moist, depending on the amount of carbonates present.  The amount of carbonate that has accumulated in some pedons is very small, and here the color of the horizon is that of the minerals that make up the weathered granitic rock.  In some pedons this horizon contains few to many thin discontinuous laminar layers that are horizontal in orientation.  These are spaced several inches apart in the weathered granitic rock.  Some of these silica-lime seams extend nearly vertically along cracks in the weathered granitic rock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Alko, Nebona, Stewart and Zalda (T NV) series.  Alko soils have pH values of 8.6 to 9.3, and lack the underlying granitic rock. Nebona soils lack the underlying granitic rock. Stewart soils contain 15 to 25 percent exchangeable sodium, are somewhat poorly drained, and lack a paralithic contact under the duripan. Zalda soils lack the paralithic contact under the duripan and have fine sandy loam or loam A horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Muroc soils are on hills and granitic rock pediments.  They formed in material weathered from granitic rocks.  Elevations are 2,400 to 3,500 feet.  Slope gradients are 2 to 15 percent.  The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 4 to 6 inches; most of the moisture occurs as rain in the late autumn and winter.  Some moisture falls occasionally as snow.  Mean annual temperature is 60 to 68 degrees F., average January temperature about 45 degrees F., and July temperature about 89 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 250 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Randsburg soils and the Hi Vista and Cajon soils. Cajon soils have sandy particle-size families, are very deep and lack duripans. Hi Vista soils have a fine-loamy particle size family and a sandy clay loam Bt horizon.   Randsburg soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches and lack a duripan."
