  "REVDATE": "09/2006",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Montegrande series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on alluvial fans, foot slopes, and toe slopes of hills in the Humid Mountains and Valleys MLRA.  They formed in stratified fine-textured sediments over gravelly colluvium of mixed origin from surrounding hills.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 77 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 57 inches.  Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent.",
