  "OVERVIEW": "The Martis series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till and outwash from mixed sources, mainly volcanic. These soils are on glacial outwash plains and have slopes of 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The mean summer soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F., but in some pedons that have 0 horizons, the mean summer soil temperature is 49 degrees to 53 degrees F.  The soil is dry between depths of 8 to 24 inches from mid-July through mid-October, and moist in all parts the rest of the year.  Pedons under open stands of timber have thin 0 horizons.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3 or 5/3 dry, and 7.5YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 10YR 3/1, 3/2, or 3/3 moist.
