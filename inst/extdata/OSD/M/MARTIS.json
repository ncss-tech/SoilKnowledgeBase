Base saturation is 35 to 50 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature is 41 degrees to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F., but in some pedons that have 0 horizons, the mean summer soil temperature is 49 degrees to 53 degrees F.  The soil is dry between depths of 8 to 24 inches from mid-July through mid-October, and moist in all parts the rest of the year.  Pedons under open stands of timber have thin 0 horizons.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/3 or 5/3 dry, and 7.5YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3; 10YR 3/1, 3/2, or 3/3 moist.  It is sandy loam or loam with 5 to 20 percent gravel.  This horizon has granular, subangular blocky, or thick platy structure.  It is slightly to strongly acid.\nThe upper part of the B2t horizon has color of 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4 dry, and 7.5YR 3/2, 4/3, 4/4; 10YR 3/3, 3/4 or 4/4.  It is sandy clay loam or heavy sandy loam with 18 to 27 percent clay, 15 to 30 percent gravel, and 3 to 5 percent cobbles.  This horizon has subangular blocky structure or is massive and has high bulk density in most pedons.  It is moderately to strongly acid.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has colors of 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4 dry and 7.5YR 3/2; 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 and 5/4 moist.  It is sandy clay loam or sandy loam and has 3 to 20 percent cobbles and 10 to 80 percent gravel.  Rock fragments increase with increasing depth and exceed 35 percent below 32 inches in some pedons."
