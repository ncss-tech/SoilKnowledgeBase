  "OVERVIEW": "The Mathis series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from sandstone. The Mathis soils are on mountain slopes. Slope ranges from 20 to 50 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F (12.2 degrees C), and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches (330 mm).",
