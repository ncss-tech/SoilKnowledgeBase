    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 36 inches.  Depth to densic materials is 20  to 38  inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 30 percent in the A horizon, 5 to 30 percent in the B horizon, and from 5 to 55 percent in the C horizon.  Rock fragments are dominantly granitic and gneissic gravel.  Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum, and strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe O horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is fibric, hemic, or sapric material.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Undisturbed pedons have an A horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4.\nSome pedons have a thin E horizon that has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The upper part is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. The lower part is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Redoximorphic features in the lower part of the Bw horizon are few to many.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand, in the fine earth fraction. Redoximorphic features are common or many.\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand in the fine earth fraction. Redoximorphic features are few to many. The C horizon is up to 12 inches thick.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture in the fine earth fraction is loamy fine sand or loamy sand, or it is fine sandy loam or sandy loam with at least 20 percent subhorizons or lenses of loamy fine sand or loamy sand. Sandy lenses are 1/8 inch to 2 inches thick and are friable to loose. In some pedons the lenses are coarse, medium, or fine sand. Consistence is firm or very firm in more than 20 percent of subhorizons. Individual aggregates are friable or firm when removed. Plates are weak or moderate, thin to thick, or the horizon is massive. Redoximorphic features in the Cd are few to many."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ashfield, Beechwood, and Middlebrook series.  Ashfield soils have rock fragments that are mostly dark colored micaceous schist and have more very fine sand, silt and clay in the Cd horizon.  Beechwood soils are from outside Region R. They formed in eolian deposits overlying friable till. Ashfield soils have loamy densic materials with less than 20 percent sandy lenses or subhorizons. Middlebrook soils are moderately deep to bedrock and have rock fragments that are mostly sandstone, siltstone and shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Metacomet soils are on drumlins and glaciated uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The soils are on nearly level to gently sloping tops of broad ridges and drumlins, and on gently sloping to moderately steep back slopes, foot slopes, and toe slopes.  The soils formed in stony till of Wisconsin age derived from granitic and gneissic rocks.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches.  The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 160 days."

The well drained Henniker soils, somewhat poorly and poorly drained Pillsbury soils, and very poorly drained Peacham soils are in a drainage sequence with Metacomet soils. Becket and Skerry soils have spodic horizons and generally occur at higher elevations."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Metacomet series is established to recognize frigid Aquic Dystrudepts formed in dense, \"sandy\" till. The concept of sandy till includes Cd horizons that are sandy as well as those that are loamy but have greater than 20% of the fabric of the till as sandy lenses or subhorizons.  The densic material has non-pedogenic structure described as plates.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Oe and Ap horizons).\n2.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 9 to 34 inches (Bw1, BW2, and BC horizons).\n3.  Aquic feature - redox depletions with in 24 inches of the surface (Bw2 horizon).\n4.  Densic contact - at 34 inches.\n5.  Densic materials - The zone from 34 to 65 inches (Cd1 and Cd2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
