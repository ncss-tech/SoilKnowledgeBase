  "OVERVIEW": "The Mamtrack series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gypsiferous eolian deposits and gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are on relict shore complexes. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
