Fragments of chert from 2 mm to 3 inches across, or fragments of limestone, from 1 to 6 inches across, range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum, and from 0 to 25 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the solum and from slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value less than 4, and chroma 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR. Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown or red. Texture is silty clay loam to clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to that of the lower Bt horizon. Mottles in shades of gray, brown or red are common. Texture is silty clay or clay."
