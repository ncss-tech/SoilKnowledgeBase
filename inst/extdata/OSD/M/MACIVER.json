  "OVERVIEW": "The Maciver series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from calcareous metamorphic and sedimentary rock sources.  These soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, escarpments, hills, mountains or landslides.  Slopes are 1 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
