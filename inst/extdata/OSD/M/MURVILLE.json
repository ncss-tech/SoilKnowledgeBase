  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:   Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.   Humus in the A and Bh horizons gives the sandy material a loamy feel and appearance.  The soil is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nA thin Oa or Oe horizon can be present in some pedons.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, or they are neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  There are few to common clean sand grains.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or mucky analogues of these textures.  Intermittent Eg horizons from 1/4 to 2 inches thick occur in fewer than 50 percent of the pedons.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Few to common uncoated sand grains may be present and some pedons may have very thin discontinuous lamellae of clean sand.  The sand grains in the lower horizons may have thin humus coatings with hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.\nSome pedons have a BEg or Eg horizon below the Bh horizon.  Where present, the BEg horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Eg horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the BEg and Eg horizons is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Thickness of the BE or Eg horizons ranges from 0 to 20 inches.  Pedons that have either of these horizons also have a B'h horizon below them that has similar properties to the Bh horizon.\nThe C horizon, and Cg horizon where present, is dominantly fine sand, sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand, but may have lenses or strata of loamy material at depths of 50 to 80 inches below the surface.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3.  The Cg horizon has the same hue and value range, but has chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons may have thin layers of darker-colored material."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Boulogne, Lynn Haven and Wesconnett series.   Boulogne soils have sola thicker than 80 inches, are fine sand or loamy fine sand only, and have firm or very firm Bh horizons.  Lynn Haven soils have continuous E horizons.  Wesconnett soils have a B'h horizon, and in addition are sand or fine sand to depths of 80 inches or more."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Murville soils are nearly level and are on flat or slight depressional areas on Coastal Plain uplands and stream terraces.  They formed in wet sandy marine or fluvial sediments .  Slopes are less than 2 percent. Near the type location, mean annual temperature is about 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Baymeade, Kureb, Leon, Lynn Haven, Rutlege, and Torhunta soils.  Baymeade, Kureb, and Leon soils are better drained and are on higher landscape positions than Murville soils.  In addition, Baymeade and Kureb soils do not have a spodic horizon.  Lynn Haven, Rutlege, and Torhunta soils are in the same landscape positions as Murville.  Lynn Haven soils have continuous E horizons, Rutlege and Torhunta soils do not have a spodic horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Murville soils are very poorly drained.  Permeability is rapid in the A horizon, and moderately rapid in the Bh horizon.  The water table is at or near the surface most of the time except during summer months or where artificially drained.  Depth to the seasonal high water table ranges from 0 to 1 foot from November to May."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Chiefly in cutover forests of pond pine, with a few scattered loblolly, longleaf pine, and red maple.  Slash pine grow in the southern part of the range.  Understory vegetation includes sweetbay, redbay, swamp cyrilla (red titi), zenobia, inkberry (bitter gallberry), large gallberry, greenbrier, switchcane, fetterbush lyonia, blueberry, loblollybay gordonia, southern bayberry (waxmyrtle), and a ground cover of sphagnum and club mosses, chainfern, broom sedge, and switchcane and maidencane in open areas.  Where frequent burning has taken place only the understory species are present."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The Murville soils were formerly included in the Ridgeland series.  However, Ridgeland soils are in a mixed mineralogy family.  The April 1993 revision of this series changed the subgroup classification from Typic Haplaquods to Umbric Endoaquods.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil properties recognized in the typical pedon are:\nUmbric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 45 inches (A and Bh horizons)\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 8 to 45 inches (Bh horizon)\nMLRA(S): 153A, 153B            SIR: NC0085\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5  Soil Name   Slope  Airtemp FrFr/Seas Precip  Elevation\nNC0085 MURVILLE    0-  2   59- 70  190-290  45- 60    10-  90\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNC0085 NONE   RARE      -     APPARENT    -     60-60\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10  Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0085  0- 8  FS S LFS                0-  0 100-100  2- 8   2- 11\nNC0085  0- 8  MK-S MK-LS MK-LFS       0-  0 100-100  2- 8   9- 22\nNC0085  8-45  FS S LFS                0-  0 100-100  2- 8   2- 10\nNC0085 45-56  FS S                    0-  0 100-100  2- 8   0-  4\nNC0085 56-70  VAR                      -       -      -      -\nSOI-5  Depth    -pH-     O.M.
