Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 16 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is silty clay loam,  silt loam, or silty clay.  It is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The lower part in some pedons has value of 4 when moist.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. It has weak or moderate, medium or coarse prismatic structure that parts to moderate, fine through coarse blocky or subangular blocky structure.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have Btk and BCk horizons.  Dark tongues extend into the C horizons in some pedons.  The C horizon typically is silty clay loam with thin lenses of very fine sand, fine sand, or silt loam.  The soil has few to many, distinct or prominent mottles below a depth of 24 to 40 inches.  Glacial till is at depths below 40 inches in some profiles. The horizons are slightly or moderately alkaline."
