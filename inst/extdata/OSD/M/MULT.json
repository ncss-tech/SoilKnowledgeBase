  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 16 inches thick.  The combined thickness of the A1 and B2t horizons ranges from 20 to 40 inches over fractured limestone bedrock.  The soils are relatively free of rock fragments, but have up to 10 percent gravel, cobble, and stone size limestone fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 36 to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of about 20 inches ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 and 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has weak to strong, fine to coarse granular structure.  This horizon ranges from neutral to medium acid and is 8 to 16 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 5.  (Only the upper portion that occurs within a depth of 16 inches has value darker than 3.5 moist and 5.5 dry.)  It ranges from silty clay loam or clay loam to heavy silt loam.  This horizon has weak to moderate, fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  It ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline.  The lower part of the B2t horizon is slightly calcareous in some pedons."

Amsden, Hourglass, Leavitt, Michelson, Sponseller, Tingey, and Wellsville soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock.  Lymanson and Tripit soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Miracle soils have 45 to 70 percent sand in the B2t horizon and more than 35 percent is fine or coarser sand.  Newlands soils contain up to 25 percent gravel or cobbles and overlie basic igneous bedrock.  Passcreek and Woosley soils have Cca horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mult soils are on strongly sloping to very steep, dominantly north or east facing mountain slopes at elevations of 6,800 to 9,500 feet.  Gradients are usually less than 30 percent and range from 9 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from limestone with some influences of shale and sandstone parent rocks.  The climate is humid.  The average annual precipitation is about 25 to 35 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is about 58 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."
