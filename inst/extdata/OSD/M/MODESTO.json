  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nA1 horizons vary in texture from loam to clay loam and in color from grayish brown (10YR 5/2) to gray (10YR 5/1) or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) and reaction from pH 6.0 to 7.0.\nB2 horizons are brown (10YR 5/3, 7.5YR 5/3) or dark brown (10YR 4/3, 7.5YR 4/3) with slightly redder clay coatings on ped surfaces.  Structure of the B2 horizon is moderate to strong coarse prismatic.  The pH is always more alkaline in the B2 horizon than in the A horizon and is generally between 7.5 and 8.0 with some segregated lime in the lower part; however, the lime occurs only intermittently.\nThe underlying material is variable ranging from sandy loam to compact silt loam similar to that found under the Dinuba soils.  Where the compact silt loam occurs at depths of 3 to 4 feet, it is often partially cemented with lime to a moderately dense hardpan.  The silty material is devoid of coarse sand indicating that it is unrelated to the solum above which is usually somewhat gritty throughout.  A few areas are affected by weak alkaline salts."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nearly level, slowly drained alluvial fans or interfan areas approaching basin topography, formerly with mound microrelief which is now largely destroyed by leveling for irrigation. Modesto soils occur at elevations of 40 to 100 feet in a mesothermal semiarid climate having a mean annual precipitation of 10 to 12 inches with hot dry summers and cool moist winters; an average temperature of 45 degrees F.  in January, 78 degrees F. in July with a mean annual temperature of 60 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is about 300 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Modesto soils are associated with the Chualar, Dinuba, and Hanford soils.  They differ from Chualar soils in that they are generally finer textured, less permeable, have hard rather than soft consistence in the A horizon, and have more distinctly blocky or prismatic B2 horizons.  Where they are underlain by silty substrata, they resemble the Dinuba soils which, however, have only weakly developed, sandy loam B2 horizons.  The Merriam soils have brown or reddish brown A horizons which abruptly overlie prismatic clay or heavy sandy clay B2 horizons."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Soils are moderately well drained to somewhat poorly (imperfectly) drained with very slow surface runoff, locally ponded.  The B2 horizon is slowly permeable and if puddled by cultivation the surface soil becomes very slowly permeable.  Water tables are variable ranging from 3 to 10 feet, depending upon the proximity of artificial drains and drainage wells.  Perched water often occur in wet years where the soil is underlain by the compact silt."

These soils are used for growing grapes, orchard, field, and forage crops and irrigated pasture.  Unless these soils are carefully managed the poor structure causes reduced yields."
