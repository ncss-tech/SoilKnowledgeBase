  "OVERVIEW": "The Marfa series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in loamy and clayey alluvium derived from Tascotal tuffaceous sandstone, Perdiz igneous conglomerate, and eolian material.  Marfa soils are on valley floors and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

These soils developed in loamy and clayey alluvium derived from Tascotal tuffaceous sandstone, Perdiz igneous conglomerate, and eolian material.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 20 inches, occurring mainly during May through October. Run off from adjacent mountains, noncalcareous felsic parent material, and a relatively stable landscape contribute to the development of an argillic horizon.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 67 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 180 to 240 days and elevation ranges from 4,000 to 6,695 feet."

Phantom soils have mollic epipedon less than 20 inches deep and do not have an argillic horizon.  Fort Russell soils are coarse-loamy and shallow to a paralithic contact.  Eppenauer soils are fine loamy and moderately deep to a paralithic contact."
