  "OVERVIEW": "The Mirasol series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to indurated or strongly cemented duripans. They are well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed from tuffaceous sandstone of Miocene age. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C (73 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 594 mm (24 in).",
