  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from about 20 to 50 inches.\nThe A horizon is dark gray (10YR 4/1; N 4/0), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2), very dark gray (10YR 3/1; N 3/0), or very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2). Colors of 3 value are limited to A horizons that are less than 6 inches thick. It is silt loam or silty clay loam, and slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizons are dark gray (10YR 4/1; N 4/0; 5Y 4/1), gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1; 5Y 5/1), or olive gray (5Y 5/2, 4/2) with brownish mottles. It is stratified silt loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay and averages between 25 and 35 percent clay and 10 to 30 percent sand that is dominantly very fine sand. The B horizon is slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has the same color, texture, and reaction range as the Bg horizon except that in some pedons, it averages more than 35 percent clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in this family. Soils in closely related families include the Commerce, Convent, Rosebloom, Waverly, and Wehadkee series. Commerce soils have moist layers below the water table. Convent soils contain less than 18 percent clay. Rosebloom and Waverly soils are strongly to very strongly acid in the 10 to 40 inch control section. Waverly soils also have less than 18 percent clay in the control section and are in an active CE activity class. Wehadkee soils have more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mhoon soils are on nearly level to slightly depressed flood plains. Slope gradients are 0 to 5 percent. The soil formed from fairly recent alkaline Mississippi River alluvium of mixed mineralogy. Most areas are protected from floods by levees. The climate is warm and humid. Mean annual precipitation is about 54 inches, and mean annual temperature is 68 degrees F., average January temperature is 53 degrees, and average July temperature is 82 degrees F, near the type location."

Convent soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section. Newellton and Tunica soils have clayey upper horizons overlying loamy horizons. Sharkey soils are clayey throughout."

    "content": "REMARKS: The Mhoon series was formerly classified in the Alluvial great soil group. Series classification changed from Typic Fluvaquents to Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts in 2002. CE activity class of superactive also assigned in 2002. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 38 inches (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3).\nAquic conditions - in all layers during the winter and spring.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
