    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 17 to 19 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. The upper part of the control section averages 30 to 60 percent pyroclastic glass. Coarse fragments in the soil average from 10 to 35 percent by volume, and range up to 50 percent in some subhorizons. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 19 inches. The pH values range from 6.4 to 7.2.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2. It is ashy silt loam or ashy sandy loam, and may be gravelly, cobbly or stony.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically a gravelly ashy sandy loam, but the range includes cobbly ashy sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It ranges from very gravelly loamy sand to very gravelly sand and very cobbly sand."

They formed in a mantle of loess and volcanic ash over glacial outwash of mixed mineralogy. These are in a continental climate. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches; the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.; and the frost free season is 95 to 180 days."
