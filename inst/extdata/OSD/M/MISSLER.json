The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The soil typically is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout, but a few pedons are neutral in the upper 7 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is silty clay loam and less commonly clay loam.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay."

Harney, Lubbock, Penden, Roxbury, and Uly soils are mesic.  In addition, Harney and Lubbock soils have argillic horizons; and Roxbury and Uly soils are fine-silty.  Mansic and Penden soils are fine-loamy and have a calcic horizon."
