  "OVERVIEW": "The Mudgetts series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from limestone and sandstone sources over a petrocalcic horizon. Mudgetts soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans. Slopes are 1 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
