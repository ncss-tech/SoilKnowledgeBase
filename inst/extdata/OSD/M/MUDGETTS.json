Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 5,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 61 to 63 degrees F. The frost-free period is 172 to 186 days."

Lechuguilla soils are Shallow to limestone bedrock and occur on upland slopes of mountains and hills. Choza soils are shallow to petrocalcic horizons and have a loamy-skeletal particle size family class. Pinery soils are very deep, have a mollic epipedon and a carbonatic mineralogy class as well as a loamy skeletal particle size class."
