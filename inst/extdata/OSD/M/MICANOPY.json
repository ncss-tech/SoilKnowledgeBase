Texture ranges from sand to loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4, with or without mottles of gray, brown, or yellow.  Texture ranges from sand to loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 3 to 6, or value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.
