    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 or more inches. It ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in all horizons.  Content of rock fragments, coarser than 2 mm is 0 to 5 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 2 to 5.  Texture ranges from sand to loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4, with or without mottles of gray, brown, or yellow.  Texture ranges from sand to loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 3 to 6, or value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The Bt2 has mottles in shades of gray, brown, yellow, and red or it is mixed with these colors.   Texture is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 or 6.  Mottles are in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Content of plinthite is 0 to 5 percent in the Bt horizon.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It has the same color ranges as the Bt1 horizon. Thickness is 0 to 4 inches.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Mottles are in shades of yellow, brown, and red.  Texture is sandy clay, clay, or sandy clay loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon below a depth of 60 inches.  It has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  The colors are often intermixed."

Understory vegetation consists of creeping bluestem, indiangrass, chalky bluestem, toothachegrass, and numerous annual forbes."
