It is sandy loam, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogues. Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 15 percent with 5 to 15 percent gravel, 5 to 5 percent cobbles and 0 to 3 percent stones and boulders. It averages between 30 and 55 percent sand with 5 to 15 percent clay.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a thin or discontinuous E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.

The till is 51 to 102 cm in thickness and overlies basalt, granite or gabbro bedrock. Mean annual temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 790 mm. Annual frost-free days range from 80 to 140 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 200 to 600 meters."

The well drained Ahmeek soils occur on shoulders and sideslopes. The moderately well drained Normanna soils occur on summits and sideslopes. The somewhat poorly drained Hermantown soils occur on footlsopes, flats and slight rises on flats. The poorly drained Canosia soils occur on toeslopes, flats and in slight depressions. The very poorly drained Giese soils occur in depressions and swales. The well drained Barto soils occur on complex bedrock controlled surfaces."
