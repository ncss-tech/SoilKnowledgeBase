The till is 51 to 102 cm in thickness and overlies basalt, granite or gabbro bedrock. Mean annual temperature ranges from 2 to 6 degrees C, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 790 mm. Annual frost-free days range from 80 to 140 days. The elevation above sea level ranges from 200 to 600 meters."

The well drained Ahmeek soils occur on shoulders and sideslopes. The moderately well drained Normanna soils occur on summits and sideslopes. The somewhat poorly drained Hermantown soils occur on footlsopes, flats and slight rises on flats. The poorly drained Canosia soils occur on toeslopes, flats and in slight depressions. The very poorly drained Giese soils occur in depressions and swales. The well drained Barto soils occur on complex bedrock controlled surfaces."
