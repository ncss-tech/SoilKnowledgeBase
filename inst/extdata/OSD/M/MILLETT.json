  "OVERVIEW": "The Millett series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium weathered from old gravelly alluvium known as \"rim gravels\".  This material is composed of quartzite, sandstone and some basic igneous rocks.  Millett soils are on stream and fan terraces on plateaus and footslopes and shoulders on stable landslides.  Slopes are 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
