  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Millett soils are on stream and fan terraces on plateaus and footslopes and shoulders on stable landslides.  They formed in old gravelly alluvium derived from quartzite, sandstone, and some basic igneous rocks. Elevation is 4,950 to 7,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 13 inches and about one-half of the total falls in July, August and September.  Ranges to 8 inches in northeastern Arizona and northwestern New Mexico.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 120 to 180 days."
