    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Melder soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 65 percent.  They have southerly aspects.  Elevations range from 2,200 to 4,000 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from granite, gneiss, and schist, and a mantle of loess and volcanic ash. The soils are in a subhumid climate with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The average annual precipitation is from 25 to 35 inches.  Average January temperature is 26 degrees F; average July\ntemperature is 66 degrees F; average annual air temperature is 46 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
