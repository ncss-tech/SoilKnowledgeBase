  "OVERVIEW": "The Melder series consists of deep and very deep, well-drained soils that formed in material weathered from granite, gneiss, and schist, with a mantle of loess and volcanic ash.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Melder soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 65 percent.  They have southerly aspects.  Average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
