    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 19 inches thick. The combined thickness of the Al and B2t horizons ranges from 22 to 44 inches. Depth to the top of the Cca horizon ranges from 22 to 44 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 46 to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 67 to 68 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 60 to 85 consecutive days during the summer. Cracks 1 to 5 cm. wide at a depth of 50 cm. are more than 30 cm. long and extend upward to the surface to the base of an Ap horizon and open and close annually. Gilgai micro-relief is evident in undisturbed areas.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 dry. It ranges from clay loam to silty clay loam. This horizon is slightly acid or neutral and is 8 to 10 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 dry and moist. It is silty clay or clay and has weak or moderate medium subangular blocky structure. This horizon has few to common, thin to moderately thick clay films on peds and in pores. It is noncalcareous and slightly acid or neutral, and ranges from 10 to 25 inches thick.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 and 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist. It is loam, silt loam or clay loam. This horizon is strongly calcareous and neutral to moderately alkaline."

Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from sandstone. The climate is moist subhumid, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 22 inches. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 63 to 65 degrees F. and the frost-free period ranges from 90 to 100 days."
