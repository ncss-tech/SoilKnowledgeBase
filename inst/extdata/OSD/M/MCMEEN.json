  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry throughout between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 80 consecutive days or more within 3 months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F. (estimated).  The control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from few scattered pebbles or cobbles in the A horizons to as much as 15 percent in the B horizon and 20 to 50 percent in the duripan.  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and has weak or moderate granular and very fine and fine subangular blocky structure.\nThe B horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam with more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It has weak medium subangular blocky to granular structure.  The lower part of the B horizon is moderately calcareous to noncalcareous and contains few firm, weakly to strongly calcareous nodules which also are throughout the B horizon in some pedons.\nThe IICsim horizon (duripan) ranges from weakly to strongly cemented.  Thin opal or silica laminae are on more than half of the surface of the duripan."

Baker and Willis soils are usually dry, have indurated duripans, and have less than 18 percent clay in the texture control section.  Endicott soils have duripans that are indurated in some subhorizon and have less than 18 percent clay in their control sections."

These soils formed in loess mixed from sediments.  The climate is semiarid continental with a mean annual precipitation of 9 to 14 inches.  The mean summer temperature is 61 to 64 degrees F.  The mean winter temperature is 31 to 34 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F.  The average frost-free period (32 degrees F.) is 50 to 120 days."
