  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 0 to 10 inches and is not deeper than the upper 2 inches of the B2 horizon.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 10 to 30 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in a major part of the control section and no subhorizon more than 3 inches thick a depth of above 20 inches exceeds these limits.  Weighted average gypsum content of the control section ranges from 0 to 1.5 percent by weight.  Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The control section is typically silt loam or silty clay loam, but averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 25 to 60 percent silt, and 10 to 45 percent sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to about 5 percent in most subhorizons above the bedrock.  They are mainly 1/8 to 1/2 inch in diameter and are mostly shale chips.  A majority of subhorizons above the bedrock have hue of 7.5YR or yellower, although a few thin subhorizons redder than 7.5YR are in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  The B2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR are in some pedons.  This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline (1.5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR.  Subhorizons redder than 7.5YR are in some pedons.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 3 to 14 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Menoken soils are on gently to steeply sloping hills, ridges, mesa tops, and valley sideslopes.  Slopes typically range from about 2 to 40 percent or more.  The soils formed in moderately thin calcareous silty medium to moderately fine materials weathered from sedimentary bedrocks.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F., and summer temperature is 72 degrees F."
