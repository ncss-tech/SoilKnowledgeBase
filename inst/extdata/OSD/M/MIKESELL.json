  "OVERVIEW": "The Mikesell series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and till derived from shale, sandstone, and quartzite.  Mikesell soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from  8 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 660 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 2.8 degrees C.",
