    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum thickness ranges from 26 to 42 inches.  The depth to the argillic horizon ranges from 12 to 20 inches. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with similar colors.  Textures of the A or Ap horizon are silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid except in cultivated areas where it is moderately acid to neutral.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.   Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent.\nSome pedons lack a Bhs horizon.  Pedons with no Bhs horizons have a Bs1 or Bs horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 3 or 4. Reaction of the Bs1 or Bs horizons is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  In pedons where there is a Bhs horizon the Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Reaction of the Bs horizon is very strongly acid to moderately acid. Textures of the Bs horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent.\nSome pedons have E/B horizons immediately below the Bs horizon with colors and textures similar to those described for the B/E horizon.\nThe Bt part of the B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam.  The E part of the B/E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is stratified fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is stratified fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.  Gravel content ranges from 2 to 10 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 2 inches (A horizon); albic horizon - the zone from 2 to 4 inches (E horizon); spodic horizon - the zone from 4 to 12 inches (Bhs and Bs horizons); glossic horizon - the zone from 12 to 25 inches (B/E horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 25 inches (B part of the B/E horizon); oxyaquic subgroup - the soil is saturated with water in one or more layers with a depth of 40 inches of the surface for one month or more in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe classification was changed to alfic oxyaquic haplorthods subgroup during the Luce County, Michigan Final correlation to conform to current soil taxonomy standards.\nThe typical pedon was moved during the Luce County Final Correlation to reflect soil properties more representative of the series throughout its range.\nPhases without the glacial till 2C substratum are recognized.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
