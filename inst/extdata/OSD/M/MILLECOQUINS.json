  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Millecoquins series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in stratified glaciolacustrine deposits on lake plains and till floored lake plains. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately slow in the lower part of the solum and the substratum. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The 10 to 40 inch control section averages less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with similar colors.  Textures of the A or Ap horizon are silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid except in cultivated areas where it is moderately acid to neutral.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.

Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent.\nSome pedons lack a Bhs horizon.  Pedons with no Bhs horizons have a Bs1 or Bs horizons with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 3 or 4. Reaction of the Bs1 or Bs horizons is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  In pedons where there is a Bhs horizon the Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Reaction of the Bs horizon is very strongly acid to moderately acid. Textures of the Bs horizons are silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent and cobble content ranges from 0 to 3 percent.\nSome pedons have E/B horizons immediately below the Bs horizon with colors and textures similar to those described for the B/E horizon.\nThe Bt part of the B/E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay loam.  The E part of the B/E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.
