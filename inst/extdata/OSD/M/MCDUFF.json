  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 56 degrees F. The soil is usually moist and is dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for less than 45 consecutive days in the four-month period following the summer solstice in most years. The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bt horizon. The depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. Content of rock fragments in the particle-size control section is 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent paragravel, and 0 to 5 percent paracobbles. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam in the upper part, and silty clay loam, clay loam, paragravelly silty clay loam or paragravelly clay loam in the lower part with 27 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 20 percent paragravel.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay, paragravelly silty clay, clay, and paragravelly clay with 40 to 60 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent paragravel, and 0 to 5 percent paracobbles.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Apt and Wintley series in the same family, and the Absaquil, Hazelcamp, and Skookumhouse soils in a similar family. Absaquil, Apt, Skookumhouse, and Wintley soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. In addition, Wintley soils have very gravelly 2C horizon at a depth of 40 inches or more. Hazelcamp soils have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR or 2.5YR. Absaquil, Hazelcamp, and Skookumhouse soils are currently in a mixed mineralogy class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McDuff soils occur on summits, shoulder slopes, and backslopes of mountains. Elevations are 300 to 3,300 feet. Where these soils are mapped in the Oregon Coast Range elevations are typically 300 to 1,800 feet and reach heights of 2,600 feet in the more southern portions of the range in southwest Oregon. Where these soils are mapped in the Oregon Cascade Range the typical elevations are 700 to 2,400 feet, and range up to 3,300 feet in the most southern geographic extent of the Cascades. Slopes are 0 to 75 percent. The soils formed in clayey colluvium and residuum derived from siltstone, sandstone, tuffaceous agglomerate, and metasedimentary rock types. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is typically 55 to 90 inches, but ranges to 130 inches in the most southern geographic extent of the soil. The mean annual temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F. The frost-free period is 120 to 240 days."

All of these soils occur on mountains. Bohannon, Digger, Klickitat, Preacher, Slickrock, and Trask soils have less than 35 percent clay and lack argillic horizons. Honeygrove and Peavine soils have Bt horizons with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR. Absaquil soils are greater than 40 inches deep to bedrock. Apt, Orford, and Honeygrove soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock."

The potential native vegetation is Douglas-fir, bigleaf maple, red alder, creambush oceanspray, salal, western hazel, vine maple, cascade Oregongrape, western swordfern, western brackenfern, baldhip rose, Pacific dogwood, violet, and trailing blackberry. A minor amount of western hemlock and western redcedar may also be present in some areas."
