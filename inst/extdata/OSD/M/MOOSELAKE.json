  "OVERVIEW": "The Mooselake series consists of very poorly drained organic soils that formed mostly in hemic organic soil material with woody fiber.  These soils are on glacial moraines and outwash lake plains.  They have moderately rapid permeability.  They have slopes of less than one percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The organic soil material extends to depths in excess of 51 inches, commonly to depths of 60 to 100 inches or more.  Content of coarse fragments (woody fragments) ranges from 0 to 10 percent with the higher contents commonly being in the upper part of the control section.  Reaction (in 0.01 M calcium chloride) in all parts of the subsurface and bottom tiers exceeds 4.5 and commonly is in the range of 5.0 to 7.0.\nThe surface tier consists of either sapric, hemic, or fibric material or a combination of two or more of those materials.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers typically consist entirely of hemic material; however, sapric or fibric materials are present in these tiers in some pedons, but the total thickness of either is less than 10 inches.\nThe major part of the hemic material in the control section has mostly woody fiber.  Such hemic material has on the broken face hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The change in color of this material after rubbing compared to that of the broken face is very slight; however, some of this material has chroma as low as 1 after rubbing.  The woody fiber is mostly less than 5 mm in size.  The content of fiber in the woody hemic material ranges from 35 to 75 percent in the undisturbed condition and 15 to 50 percent after rubbing.  The content of mineral material ranges from 10 to 25 percent.  Some pedons have hemic material that consists mostly of herbaceous fiber in part to all of the bottom tier."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Rifle series, which is the only other series in that family and the closely related Greenwood, Lupton, and Spalding series.  Rifle and Greenwood soils have hemic material with mostly herbaceous fiber.  Also Greenwood soils are more acid.  Lupton soils have sapric material dominant in the subsurface tier.  Spalding soils are more acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed primarily in moderately decomposed woody material that is more than 51 inches thick.  Glacial sediments of variable texture underlie this material commonly beginning at depths of 5 to 10 feet.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 32 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 42 degrees F."

Associated mineral soils primarily include those developed in reddish, noncalcareous loamy glacial till such as the Ahmeek and Duluth soils and their respective topographic associates."
