  "OVERVIEW": "The Maloney series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on plateaus. They formed in loess and material weathered from basalt. Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 5 to 20 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
