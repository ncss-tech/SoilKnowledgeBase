  "OVERVIEW": "The Marcel series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alpine glacial till or alluvium from hard fine grained igneous, metamorphic or sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, structural benches, and on sides of hills and ridges in mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
