  "OVERVIEW": "The Midnot series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium over residuum from semi-consolidated shale, siltstone or mudstone. These soils are on eroded fan remnants, eroded fan remnant side slopes, and escarpments. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.4 degrees C.",
