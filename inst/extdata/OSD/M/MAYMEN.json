    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to highly fractured paralithic bedrock contact is 10 to 20 inches. The bedrock usually has some soil material between fragments in the upper few inches of the paralithic contact.\nThe mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 59 degrees F. The soil between a depth of 6 inches and the paralithic contact is dry in all parts from mid May or June through September or early October and is moist in all parts from November through May. The particle size control section averages 10 to 27 percent clay, and 3 to 35 percent rock fragments.\nReaction is very strongly acid through slightly acid and tends to become more acid with increasing depth. The epipedon is either too thin or has too little organic matter, or both, to qualify as a mollic epipedon. Base saturation by sum of cations method ranges from 35 to 75 percent based on lab data from Maymen and similar soils and pH. Rock fragments on the surface range from 0 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 6/6, 5/6, 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 7/4, 6/6, 6/4, 5/6, 5/4 or 4/4. Moist color is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/4, 3/3, 3/2, 2/2; 7.5YR 5/8, 5/6, 5/4, 5/2, 4/6, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2, 3/4 or 3/2. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam or sandy loam or their gravelly equivalents as well as stony sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam. .\nThe Bw horizon dry color is 10YR 7/3, 6/6, 6/6, 6/3, 6/2, 5/6, 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/4, 4/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 7/4, 6/6, 6/4, 5/8, 5/6, 5/4 or 4/4. Moist color is 10YR 5/5, 5/4, 5/3, 4/4, 4/3, 3/3; 7.5YR 5/6, 5/4, 5/2, 4/6, 4/4, 4/3, 3/4 or 2.5/3. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, silt loam or loam and their gravelly equivalents and gravelly fine sandy loam. The Bw horizon has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure. Some pedons have a slight increase in clay over the A horizon but not enough to qualify as an argillic horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Maymen soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 100 percent, elevations are 400 to 4,250 feet. Underlying bedrock is consolidated sandstone, shale or conglomerate. The climate is moist subhumid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 22 to 70 inches. Average January temperature is 47 degrees F., average July temperature is about 68 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 52 to 59 degrees F. Frost free period is about 130 to 330 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: During MLRA updating, those map units of Maymen mapped in MLRA 20 and 22 need to be separated from Maymen in MLRA 5 and 15 with the establishment of a new series. Type location for Maymen moved because original location was not accessible or locatable. This site was judged to be the concept of Maymen as mapped in the coast ranges. The bedrock contact was redefined due to the common fine fracturing, resulting in changing the classification from lithic to typic.  Lithic determinations of the 1970s is questionable by 21st century standards..\nParticle Size Control Section for this pedon:   1.6 to 12 in.       (4 to 31 cm). The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from about May 15 to October 15 (about 150 days).\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of California, Davis, Morphology Lab Pedon # 56CA11026 and 58CA52029.
