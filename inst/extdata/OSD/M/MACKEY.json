  "OVERVIEW": "The Mackey series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from extrusive rocks and loess.  Mackey soils are on foothills, dipslopes, and mountains and have slopes of 8 to 60 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and the average annual air temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.",
