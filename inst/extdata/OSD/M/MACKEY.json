These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from mixed sources, including quartz latite, ignimbrite, welded tuff, basalt, rhyolite, and andesite with some influence of loess.  The climate is semiarid.  Average annual precipitation is about 250 to 360 mm.  Average annual temperature is about 8.3 to 10.6 degrees C.  Frost-free period is about 100 to 130 days."
