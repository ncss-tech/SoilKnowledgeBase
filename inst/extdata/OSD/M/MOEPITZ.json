  "REVDATE": "11/2006",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Moepitz series consists of moderately deep, well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium and eolian deposits over material weathered from sandstone and shale. Moepitz soils are on rolling uplands, hillslopes on structural benches, and breaks and have slopes of 1 to 30 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
