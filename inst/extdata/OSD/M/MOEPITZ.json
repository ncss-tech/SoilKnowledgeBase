These soils formed in mixed alluvium, eolian material weathered from sandstone and shale. The climate is arid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 9 inches. The mean annual temperature is 51 to 57 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 75 to 79 degrees F. and the freeze-free period ranges from 150 to 190 days."
