  "OVERVIEW": "The Mallory series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess and slope alluvium, and colluvium from basalt.  Mallory soils are on canyon walls, hills and shoulders and have slopes of 2 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 17 to 25 inches and average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 45 to 75 percent angular basalt fragments and is 38 to 50 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 35 inches thick and includes all or part of the argillic horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 dry. 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 1 or 2 moist.  The AB horizon is very cobbly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5 YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly, extremely cobbly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly clay, silty clay, or clay loam."
