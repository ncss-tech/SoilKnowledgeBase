  "OVERVIEW": "The Multorpor series consists of deep, excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium weathered mostly from intermediate and basic igneous rocks.  Multorpor soils are along high gradient streams and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches and the mean annual temperature  is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist and are dry between depths of 12 and 35 inches for less than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section is very   cobbly coarse sand or extremely stony coarse sand with 45 to 80 percent rock fragments.  Stones or cobbles are dominant sizes of rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 0.  It is extremely stony coarse sand or very cobbly loamy sand.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe AC horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  Few fine variegations of dark yellowish brown and brown are in the upper few inches of the profile in some pedons.\nThe C horizon is similar to the AC horizon in color except that the dominant chroma is 1 moist and dry.\nIt is strongly acid or medium acid."

Bonaparte, Hinckley and Otisville soils have Bw horizons with chroma of 3 or more.  Manchester soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bw and C horizons.  Quonset soils receive 40 to 50 inches of precipitation and have sola 15 to 50 inches thick.  Speelyai soils are 9 to 20 inches deep to cemented horizons."

The soils formed in stony, coarse-textured alluvium less than 1,000 years old and weathered from intermediate and basic igneous rocks.  The climate is humid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 120 inches, falling as rain in the autumn and spring, and snow or rain in the winter.  Rainfall amounts are relatively low in the summer.  The mean January temperature is 33 degrees F.  The mean July temperature\nis 63 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 130 days."
