Blackotter soils are poorly drained, occur on slightly lower landscape positions and have a coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal control section.  Cookcan soils are poorly drained and occur slightly lower concave positions.  Lago soils occur on similar landscape positions and have a fine-silty control section.  Nuffer soils occur on similar landscape positions, have a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick and have a loamy-skeletal control section.  Ream soils are moderately well drained and occur on higher landscape positions."
