  "OVERVIEW": "The Millerditch series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on low stream terraces and undulating flood plains. They formed in stratified alluvium. Permeability is moderate. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
