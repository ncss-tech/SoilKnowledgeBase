  "OVERVIEW": "The Medaryville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy water-sorted materials and in the underlying lacustrine materials on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
