  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually saturated above the Bsm horizon during the winter and spring. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. The soil has a aquic moisture regime; but has a short dry period of less than 30 days during the four-month period following the summer solstice. Depth to the cemented layer is 8 to 18 inches and depth to dense till is 10 to 20 inches from the mineral soil surface. The particle size control section averages 15 to 27 percent clay.\nThe E horizon has 10 to 20 percent organic matter. It has value of 5 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry. Reaction is strongly acid.\nThe Bsm horizon is 1 to 2 inches thick and is strongly cemented by iron organic matter and aluminum. It has hue of 10YR to 5YR moist, and 5YR and 2.5Y dry, value of 4 or 5 moist and 5 or 7 dry, and chroma 6 moist, 4 through 8 dry. It has 1 to 5 percent organic matter. Reaction is moderately acid\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 moist and 8 dry, and chroma of 6 moist and 4 dry. It is extremely gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam. It has 8 to 22 percent clay and 0 to 3 percent organic matter. Reaction is moderately acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Macafee soils are on ground moraines on till plains at elevations of 60 to 630 feet. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. These soils formed in alpine glacial till derived from sedimentary and metasedimentary rocks. The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers and cool, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 120 inches. The average January temperature is about 40 degrees F; the average July temperature is about 60 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. The frost free season is 180 to 220 days."

Copalisrock soils are very poorly drained, have a histic epipedon, and are 20 to 40 inches to dense till. Kydaka soils have a mucky surface horizon, and are 20 to 40 inches to dense till. Moclips soils have a placic horizon at a depth of 6 to 12 inches and lack the densic contact. Papac soils are moderately well drained and are 20 to 40 inches to dense till."
