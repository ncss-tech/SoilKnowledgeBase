  "OVERVIEW": "The Mota series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in deep eolian very fine sand deposits. Mota soils are on undulating to rolling uplands and benches. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

These soils were formed in deep eolian very fine sand deposits. The mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 77 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches. Frost-free period is about 150 to 180 days."
