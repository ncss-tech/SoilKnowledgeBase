The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Depth to the 2C horizon is 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 40 inches thick. The weighted average clay content in the upper part of the particle-size control section is 10 to 18 percent.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It contains 0 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe A2 and AC horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is loam, silt loam and very fine sandy loam and contains 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.

Boesel soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days, have 14 to 18 inches of precipitation , are moderately well drained and are derived from glacial outwash. Josset soils are calcareous throughout, slightly to moderately alkaline, and they are moderately well drained with a water table at 30 to 40 inches from January to June."

The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches, the mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
