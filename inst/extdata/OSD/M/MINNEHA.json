  "OVERVIEW": "The Minneha series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum derived from granitic rocks. Minneha soils are on mountains. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
