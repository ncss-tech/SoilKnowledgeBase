Reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the A and Bt horizons, and moderately alkaline in the Btk, B't, and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Content of pebbles is less than 10 percent, by volume.  Texture is clay loam or clay.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 To 5, and chroma of 3 To 6.  Content of pebbles range from 15 to 60 percent, by volume, but weighted average is below 35 percent for the control section.  Filaments and soft masses of calcium carbonate range from common to many.  Texture is clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B't horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 7.  Content of pebbles range from 0 to 30 percent, by volume.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam, clay, or their gravelly analogues.\nThe BCk horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Content of pebbles and cobbles range from 35 to 75 percent, by volume.
