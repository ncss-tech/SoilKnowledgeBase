    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development is 61 to 132 cm (24 to 52 inches) and commonly extends beyond the depth to carbonates. The depth to carbonates and horizons with greater than 15 percent sand ranges from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). The mollic epipedon is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick. The reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the upper part of the series control section and from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, or neutral, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4 and commonly contains redoximorphic features that have chroma of 2 through 8. It is silty clay loam or silt loam.\nThe 2Bt or 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 through 8. It commonly is stratified. Textures include silt loam, loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8. It is stratified. Textures include silt, silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, and thin strata of fine sand, very fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy very fine sand. Average clay content is less than 27 percent. Average sand content is less than 70 percent. Rock fragment content is less than 15 percent."

Arrowsmith, Harco, Higginsville, and Muscatune soils contain less than 10 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Bearpen, Brenton, Edwardsville, Elburn, Hacreek, Rowley, and Shannondale soils do not contain carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Grundelein and Lafayette soils contain greater than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Keller, Raub, and Rooks soils average greater than 27 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Lawndale soils contain greater than 70 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Lisbon and Lismod soils are not stratified and, therefore, have a well graded sand fraction throughout the lower part of the series control section. Loran soils have a paralithic contact within the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mundelein soils are on nearly level or gently sloping parts of relatively undissected outwash plains and lake plains of Wisconsinan Age. The topography is rather smooth and uniform, and slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent. The soils formed in loess or silty material and the underlying calcareous stratified loamy outwash. Mean annual air temperature ranges between 7 and 11 degrees C (45 and 52 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges between 740 to 1020 mm (29 and 40 inches), frost free days range between 140 and 180, and elevation ranges between 183 to 311 meters (600 and 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Barrington soils are on higher ridges and more rolling slopes and are in a drainage sequence with Mundelein soils. Wauconda soils are on similar nearby landscapes and do not have a mollic epipedon. The poorly drained Pella soils are also in a drainage sequence with Mundelein soils."

An intermittent high water table is at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (1 foot to 2 feet) below the surface between January and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4,23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."
