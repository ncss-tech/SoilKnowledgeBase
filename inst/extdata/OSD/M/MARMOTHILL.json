    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marmothill soils are on hills, mountains and plateaus.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from altered volcanic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,475 to 2,800 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The majority of the precipitation occurs as snow, much of which is removed from the surface of the soil through wind action.  This removal of snow greatly reduces the effective precipitation on this soil relative to surrounding non-convex areas.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days."
