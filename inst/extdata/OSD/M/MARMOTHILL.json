  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marmothill soils are on hills, mountains and plateaus.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from altered volcanic rocks with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 2,475 to 2,800 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The majority of the precipitation occurs as snow, much of which is removed from the surface of the soil through wind action.  This removal of snow greatly reduces the effective precipitation on this soil relative to surrounding non-convex areas.  The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 460 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 70 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 25 cm (A1, A2, and Bt horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 12 to 152 cm (Bt, 2Btss, 2Btky1, 2Btky2, 2Btky3, and 2Btk horizons).\nVertic subgroup feature - A linear extensibility of 6 cm or more between the soil surface and 100 cm.\nPalexerolls great group feature - No clay decrease of 20 percent or more from the maximum clay content in the lower part of the argillic horizon (Bt, 2Btss, 2Btky1, 2Btky2, 2Btky3, and  2Btk horizons).\nSlickensides - The zone from 25 to 56 cm (2Btss horizon).\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates - The zone from 56 to 152 cm (2Btky1, 2Btky2, 2Btky3, and 2Btk horizons).\nMajor lithologic discontinuity - The abrupt change to clayey material at 25 cm (between the Bt and 2Btss horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 12 to 100 cm (Bt, 2Btss, 2Btky1, and 2Btky2 horizons and part of the 2Btky3 horizon).\nNote: The upper part of the particle-size control section (the Bt horizon from 12 to 25 cm) has more than 35 percent by volume rock fragments.  This series would classify in a strongly contrasting particle-size class of ashy-skeletal over clayey if it was present in the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Volcanic glass content in the A1, A2, and Bt horizons was determined locally by optical grain counts using a polarizing petrographic microscope.  Observed glass contents in these horizons are 57, 51, and 42 percent in the fine sand fractions, respectively.\nClassification was changed 3/2017 from Ashy over clayey, glassy over smectitic, frigid Vertic Palexerolls to Ashy-skeletal over clayey, glassy over smectitic, frigid Vertic Palexerolls.\nUser Pedon ID: 2007CA051005\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
