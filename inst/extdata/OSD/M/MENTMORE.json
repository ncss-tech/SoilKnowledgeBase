Blancot soils do not have Bk horizons or accumulations of gypsum. Balon, Decolney and Gaddes soils are noncalcareous throughout. Bowbac, Cerropelon, Cushman, Gaddes, Gapbutte, Gapmesa, Hagerman, Hagerwest, Pokeman, Pugsley, and Spangler soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Buckle soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 50 to 55 degrees F and less sand and more silt in the control section. Cambria soils are less than 10 inches deep to the base of the Bt. Chilerojo soils are very deep to a densic contact. Cumacho soils are deep to a paralithic contact of shale. Doakum soils have hues 10YR and redder. Oelop soils have Bt horizons with a base less than 40 inches deep. Palacid soils have calcium carbonate accumulations at 10 to 15 inches. Penistaja and Redpen soils are warmer and receive less effective winter moisture. The Yenlo soils have more than 40 percent sand. Quagwa soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 54 to 57 degrees F. Sundance and Teckla soils have a lithologic discontinuity at 20 to 40 inches. Tamarindo soils have hue 7.5YR and redder. Yenlo soils have sola 15 to 30 inches thick. In addition, Bowbac, Cushman, Decolney, Fort, Forkwood, Hagerman, Hiland, Olney, Pokeman, Potts, Pugsley, Spangler, Sundance, Teckla and Yenlo soils are in LRR-G and are more moist in May and June."

These soils formed in alluvium, fan alluvium, and slope alluvium derived from shale and sandstone of the Menefee formation. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Elevations range from 6,100 to 7,200 feet. The climate is semiarid. Mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches. The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 135 days."
