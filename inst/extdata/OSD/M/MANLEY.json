  "OVERVIEW": "The Manley series consists of moderately deep to a densic contact, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash over glacial till.  Manley soils are on the slopes of foothills and mountains and on ridgetops.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 890mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 3.8 C.",
