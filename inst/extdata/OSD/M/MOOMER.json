  "OVERVIEW": "The Moomer series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metavolcanic rocks. The Moomer soils are moderately deep to highly fractured and weathered soft basalt. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 15 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1524 millimeters (60 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
