Diawell soils have duripans 5 to 13 cm thick and have Bkq horizons above the duripan.  Minu soils have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 12 degrees C. and have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Muni soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 11 degrees C., are not moist in the summer, and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.

They formed in alluvium derived from granitic rock or volcanic rocks and with surficial deposits of eolian volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,524 to 2,195 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 90 to 130 days."

Based on lab data from adjacent soils there is a strong possibility that volcanic glass contents in the A horizons are much greater than 30 percent.\nUser Pedon ID 2007NV021092.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
