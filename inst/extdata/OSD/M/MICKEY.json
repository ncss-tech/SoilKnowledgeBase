  "OVERVIEW": "The Mickey series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks or volcanic rocks and with surficial deposits of eolian volcanic ash.  Mickey soils are on ballenas and fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",

Based on lab data from adjacent soils there is a strong possibility that volcanic glass contents in the A horizons are much greater than 30 percent.\nUser Pedon ID 2007NV021092.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
