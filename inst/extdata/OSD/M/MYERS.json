  "OVERVIEW": "The Myers series consists of very deep, well to moderately well drained soils on flood basins and alluvial fans.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Slickensides and pressure faces are common to many from depths of about 10 to about 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F.  These soils have cracks 30 to 50 inches deep that open in May and June and remain open until November.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 6/3, 6/2, 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2; 2.5Y 5/2. Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2.  Texture is clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam with more than 30 percent clay in all pedons. This horizon has angular blocky to prismatic structure that separates to granular structure on the surface after prolonged drying.  Reaction is medium acid to slightly alkaline, becoming more alkaline with depth.  In some pedons there is segregated lime in the lower part of the A horizon.\nThe Bss, Btss and Bt horizon color is 10YR 6/4, 5/4, 5/3, 4/3; 5Y 5/3, 5/2, 5/1. Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 4/3; 5Y 5/2, 4/3. Texture is clay or silty clay and in some pedons is clay loam in the lower part.  This horizon ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline, and is usually calcareous but is intermittently calcareous or may be free of lime above 60 inches in some pedons.  A few pedons are mottled in the lower part."

Ayar, Capay, Centerville, Porterville and Seville soils have dark colored A horizons with dry values of 5 or less and moist values of 3 or 2.  In addition Ayar soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 70 inches.  Campbell soils lack slickensides and are saturated with water between depths of 40 and 60 inches during part of the year.  Sehorn soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 23 to 40 inches."

The climate is dry subhumid, mesothermal, with hot, dry summers and cool moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 15 to 30 inches.  Average January temperature is 44 degrees F., average July temperature is 78 degrees F., and a mean annual temperature is about 58 to 62 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 250 to 280 days."

Competing series not reviewed at that time.\nEdits made after sdjr project and the pH values by pH meter from the original profile description were added. Lat long coordinates were determined from legal description. It is peculiar that this series is stated to have been established in Tehama County because the CA645 TUD is actually from Colusa County. - AEC\nOSED scanned by SSQA."
