  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Monaberg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and alpine till derived from hard fine grained igneous and metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, fan remnants, moraines, hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
