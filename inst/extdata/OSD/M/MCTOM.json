    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McTom soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granodiorite.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 9,500 to 11,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches, the mean annual temperature is 33 to 38 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
