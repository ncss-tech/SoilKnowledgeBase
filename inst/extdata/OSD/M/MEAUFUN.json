  "OVERVIEW": "The Meaufun series consists of deep, well drained soils on backslopes of mountains.  Meaufun soils formed in volcanic ash mixed with colluvium overlying clay-producing tuffs or olivine basalt.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
