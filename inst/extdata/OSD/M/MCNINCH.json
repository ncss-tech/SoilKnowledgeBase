  "OVERVIEW": "The McNinch series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from quartzite.  These soils occur on hills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and mean air annual temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
