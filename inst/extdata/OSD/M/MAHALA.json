  "OVERVIEW": "The Mahala series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in a thin loess mantle over residuum derived from tuff.  Mahala soils are on rock pediments, plateaus, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
