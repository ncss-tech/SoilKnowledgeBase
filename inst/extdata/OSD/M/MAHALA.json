  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mahala soils are on rock pediments, plateaus, and hills.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and backslope positions.  These soils formed in thin loess mantle over residuum derived from tuff.  Elevations are 1,650 to 1,895 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. The climate is cool semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 80 to 120 days."

Hunnton soils have indurated duripans between 56 and 89 cm.  Ramires soils have mollic epipedons.  Gance soils have 35 to 75 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Wieland soils do not have an abrupt textural change between the ochric epipedon and the argillic horizon."
