    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  These soils can support submerged aquatic vegetation primarily as Zostera marina (Eelgrass) and/or Ruppia maritima (Widgeon grass) and often provide excellent aquatic habitat.  Vegetative coverage of these soils ranges from 0 to 100 percent depending upon landform.  The aquatic vegetation in these areas is extremely sensitive to human disturbance and watercraft propeller damage can easily remove the vegetative coverage leaving a bare soil surface."
