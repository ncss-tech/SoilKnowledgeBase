  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 10 and 30 inches is usually dry all of the time from late April or May until November or early December and is usually moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.   The textural control section (10 to 40 inches) averages loamy sand.  Individual strata are sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam and loam plus minor thin silty lenses.  Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth and on the average is less than 1 percent.  The soil is neutral, slightly or moderately alkaline, although most pedons are moderately alkaline in most parts.  Individual strata are noncalcareous or weakly to strongly calcareous.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 15 percent, although individual strata may reach 35 percent.  A few mottles are present in some pedons but they seem to be relic from initial deposition and are associated with the finer textures.\nThe A and C horizons are 10YR 7/3, 6/1, 6/4, 5/2, 5/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 5/2, 5/4."

The alluvium is derived from mixed but mostly sedimentary sources.  The climate is dry mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.   Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 20 inches.  The average January temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F; the average July temperature is 62 to 75 degrees F and the mean annual temperature is 57 to 60 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 175 to 340 days."
