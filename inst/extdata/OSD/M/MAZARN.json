  "REVDATE": "10/2001",
  "STATES": "AR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mazarn series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments from shale, siltstone and sandstone. These soils are adjacent to small, upland drains and intermittent streams in the Ouachita Mountains; MLRA 119. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 52 inches.",

These areas often do not have a well defined channel or floodplain. These soils formed in loamy sediments from adjacent uplands underlain by shale, siltstone and sandstone. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F., and the annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 56 inches."

Avilla and Spadra soils, which are on terraces at higher elevations, are deep to bedrock and are well drained. Bismarck soils, which are on adjacent uplands, are shallow to shale bedrock and are well drained. Carnasaw soils, which are on adjacent uplands, have a clayey control section and are well drained. Ceda soils, which are on floodplains, have a loamy-skeletal control section and are well drained. Leadvale soils, which are on terraces, are moderately well drained and have a fragipan. Littlefir soils formed in shale, sandstone, or siltstone on adjacent uplands. Nashoba soils formed in residuum of sandstone, and are on adjacent uplands. Sherless soils formed in residuum of interbedded shale and sandstone, and are on adjacent uplands."

A perched, seasonally high water table is within 1 to 2 feet of the soil surface during the months of December through May most years. Some areas flood occasionally for very brief periods from December through May."
