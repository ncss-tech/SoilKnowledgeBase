Columbus soils have sola 35 to 60 inches thick and do not have a paralithic contact. Eunola and Yauhannah soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick and do not have a paralithic contact. Mollicy soils have sola greater than 55 inches thick and do not have a paralithic contact. Slagle soils have sola 40 to 60 inches or more and do not have a paralithic contact. Whitwell soils have sola 30 to 60 inches thick and do not have a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mazarn soils are on concave to level areas adjacent upland drains and small intermittent streams in the Ouachita Mountains. These areas often do not have a well defined channel or floodplain. These soils formed in loamy sediments from adjacent uplands underlain by shale, siltstone and sandstone. The mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F., and the annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 56 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Avilla, Bismarck, Carnasaw, Ceda, Leadvale, Littlefir, Nashoba, Sherless, and Spadra soils. Avilla and Spadra soils, which are on terraces at higher elevations, are deep to bedrock and are well drained. Bismarck soils, which are on adjacent uplands, are shallow to shale bedrock and are well drained. Carnasaw soils, which are on adjacent uplands, have a clayey control section and are well drained. Ceda soils, which are on floodplains, have a loamy-skeletal control section and are well drained. Leadvale soils, which are on terraces, are moderately well drained and have a fragipan. Littlefir soils formed in shale, sandstone, or siltstone on adjacent uplands. Nashoba soils formed in residuum of sandstone, and are on adjacent uplands. Sherless soils formed in residuum of interbedded shale and sandstone, and are on adjacent uplands."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Mazarn soils are somewhat poorly drained. Permeability is moderately slow and runoff is slow. A perched, seasonally high water table is within 1 to 2 feet of the soil surface during the months of December through May most years. Some areas flood occasionally for very brief periods from December through May."
