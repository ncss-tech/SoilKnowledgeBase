    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 46 degrees F.; and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 66 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for a continuous period of about 45 days in the late summer.  The organic matter content of the upper 15 inches ranges from 1.0 to 2.0 percent.  In some areas, the profile contains up to 10 percent basalt pebbles and cobbles. Bedrock is at depths of 4O to 65 inches.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 3 or 4 dry.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry.\nThe Cca horizon has value of 6, 7 or 8 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 and contains 1 to 10 percent very hard or hard cylindrical nodules of soil material or cicada krotovinas in some pedons.  This horizon is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.2 to 9.0)."

The soils formed in moderately coarse textured eolian deposits partially of basaltic origin.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches including 1 to 3 feet of snowfall.  The average freeze-free period is 80 to 115 days.  Maximum precipitation is in May and June."
