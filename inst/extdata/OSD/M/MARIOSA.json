  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mariosa soils are on level to gently sloping summits or sideslopes of remnant plateaus.  Slope gradients typically are less than 2 percent on summit areas, and range up to 3 percent on long sideslopes which are usually eroded.  These soils formed in loess overlying an erosional lag concentrate from Pennsylvanian material. Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 44 inches."
