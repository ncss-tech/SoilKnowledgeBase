  "OVERVIEW": "The Mariosa series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in loess and the underlying erosional lag concentrate on upland plateau remnants.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches.",

Slope gradients typically are less than 2 percent on summit areas, and range up to 3 percent on long sideslopes which are usually eroded.  These soils formed in loess overlying an erosional lag concentrate from Pennsylvanian material. Mean annual temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 44 inches."
