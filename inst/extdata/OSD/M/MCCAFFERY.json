    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  McCaffery soils have mean annual soil temperature ranging from 44 degrees to 47 degrees F. and have average summer soil temperature ranging from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The E2 and E&B horizons are loamy fine sand or fine sand with 2 to 10 percent clay and 5 to 15 percent coarser than medium sand.  Depth to E&B horizons ranges from 20 to 40 inches and these consist of lamellae of fine sandy loam in loamy fine sand or of loamy fine sand in fine sand.  The lamellae are discontinuous 1/4 to 2 inch bands that make up from 10 to 15 percent of the matrix between depths of 3 to 5 feet.  The E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is slightly or moderately acid.  The E&B horizon is neutral or slightly acid.  The B horizon portion has value of 5 or 6."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McCaffery soils are on rolling or sloping high lacustrine benches or river terraces in intermountain valleys.  They formed in sandy sediments that in some parts have been reworked by wind.   The sandy sediments are associated with varved silt and clays as well as stratified very gravelly and cobbly sand deposits.  The climate is cool subhumid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 44 degrees to 46 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 30 inches."

Entente soils are coarse-silty and Half Moon soils are fine-silty.  Krause soils are sandy-skeletal and Neville soils are fine-loamy.  Krause and Neville soils are on smooth benches."
