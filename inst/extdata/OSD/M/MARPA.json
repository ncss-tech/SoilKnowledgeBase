  "OVERVIEW": "The Marpa series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from shale, sandstone, schist and other metavolcanic or metasedimentary rocks.  Marpa soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 54 degrees to 59 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section most years between mid June or mid July and mid October. Rock fragments consist mostly of cobbles and gravel and make up 15 to 45 percent of the A horizon and 35 to 75 percent of the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4, 7/2; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, or 6/6.  Moist colors are 5YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/2, 4/4; 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4.  Texture is gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam with 12 to 25 percent clay.  This horizon has weak or moderate granular structure.  It is soft to hard and very friable or friable.  Reaction is neutral through moderately acid and the base saturation ranges from 35 to 50 percent.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4 6/8; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4).  Moist colors are 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/4.  Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam modified by gravel or cobbles totaling 35 to 60 percent.  The Bt has 27 to 35 percent clay and is gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly.  This horizon has 4 to 12 percent more clay than the A horizon.  Structure is massive or has moderate subangular blocky.  It is slightly hard or hard and is slightly acid to strongly acid. Base saturation ranges from 35 to 60 percent by sum of cations."

Abegg, Asabean, Gasper, Holohan, Hoosimbim, Pendola, and Collayomi soils are more than 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Behemotosh soils have a Bt horizon with moist value of 5 or 6, moist chroma of 6 or 8, and have loam or sandy clay loam control sections with 18 to 27 percent clay.  Skalan soils have mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F.  Whispering soils have base saturation of 50 to 75 percent and are strongly influenced by amorphous material and have obsidian fragments.  Hollowtree soils are presently not adequately competed."

The soils formed in material weathered from hard fractured schist or slightly metamorphosed shales and sandstone.  Elevations are 1,500 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches.  Seasonal snowfall ranges from 5 to 25 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 47 to 58 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 90 to 250 days."

Boomer soils have a fine-loamy control section and a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Goulding, Maymen, Neuns, and Sheetiron soils lack an argillic horizon.  Also, Goulding and Maymen soils are less than 20 inches to hard bedrock.  Hilt soils have a fine-loamy control section with less than 35 percent coarse fragments and a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Sites soils have a clayey control section with base saturation decreasing to less than 35 percent."
