  "OVERVIEW": "The Marosa series consists of deep, well drained soil that formed in material weathered from andesite, granite and rhyolite.  Marosa soils are on sideslopes of mountains and have slopes of 0 to 80 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
