  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Marcott series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  These soils are on alluvial fans, floodplains and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
