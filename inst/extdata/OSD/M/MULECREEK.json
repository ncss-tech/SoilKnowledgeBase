  "OVERVIEW": "The Mulecreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources including sandstone and mudstone. Mulecreek soils are on stream terraces and alluvial fans in mountain river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1650 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
