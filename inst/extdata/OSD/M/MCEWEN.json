  "OVERVIEW": "The McEwen series consists of very deep, well drained soils on alluvial terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface horizons. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Thickness of the loess and ash influenced mantle and depth to the contrasting 2Bt horizon is 7 to 13 inches.  It has between 0.40 and 1.0 percent acid oxylate Al + 1/2Fe and more than 5 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate (assumed).  The mean annual soil temperature is about 43 to 47 degrees F. Depth to very or extremely gravelly stratified materials ranges from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon is ashy loam or ashy silt loam and has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bt horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam, averaging 27 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe 3C horizon is is loam or sandy loam.  It has 45 to 70 percent coarse fragments, of which 40 to 50 percent are gravel and 5 to 20 are cobbles."
