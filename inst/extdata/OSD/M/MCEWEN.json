    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days within the four-month period following the summer solstice and are moist during the winter months.  Thickness of the loess and ash influenced mantle and depth to the contrasting 2Bt horizon is 7 to 13 inches.  It has between 0.40 and 1.0 percent acid oxylate Al + 1/2Fe and more than 5 percent volcanic glass and glass aggregate (assumed).  The mean annual soil temperature is about 43 to 47 degrees F. Depth to very or extremely gravelly stratified materials ranges from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon is ashy loam or ashy silt loam and has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bt horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam, averaging 27 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe 3C horizon is is loam or sandy loam.  It has 45 to 70 percent coarse fragments, of which 40 to 50 percent are gravel and 5 to 20 are cobbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  McEwen soils are on alluvial terraces. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  Elevations range from 3,900 to 4,400 feet.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in the surface horizons. The climate is characterized by cold and wet winters and hot and dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free is 50 to 90 days.  This soil is on the Dolph geomorphic surface."

Highhorn and Huntrock soils are loamy-skeletal, have an ochric epipedon and are mapped on south slopes of adjacent uplands.  Stovepipe, Sumpley and Webfoot soils have contrasting textures within the control section and are mapped on adjacent bottom lands."
