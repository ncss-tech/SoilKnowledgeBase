  "OVERVIEW": "The McPan series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in loess and silty alluvium from weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt.  McPan soils are on plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe term silty alluvium used in this series concept infers a localized influence on the mixed loess and weathered volcanic ash soil mantle by overland flow of running water.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
