McPan soils are underlain by basalt and formed in silty alluvium from weathered volcanic ash mixed with colluvium from basalt.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  Elevation is 3,000 to 4,700 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The average annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 160 days."

There will be further investigation from an MLRA project level as to the accepted terms for use.\nThe term silty alluvium used in this series concept infers a localized influence on the mixed loess and weathered volcanic ash soil mantle by overland flow of running water.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
