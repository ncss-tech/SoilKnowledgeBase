  "OVERVIEW": "The Morrisville series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy till and the underlying residuum from interbedded limestone and clayey shale. These soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 12 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
