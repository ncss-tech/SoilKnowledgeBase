  "OVERVIEW": "The Mt. Zion series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from metabasalt and metarhyolite.  They are on nearly level to moderately steep mountain backslopes and footslopes in the Blue Ridge province.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",
