  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 24 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3 or it is neutral with value of 2.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon within the mollic epipedon has the same color range as the A horizon.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt and Btk horizons below the mollic epipedon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon averages between 18 and 30 percent clay and from 10 to 20 percent sand that is dominantly very fine sand.  The Btk horizon contains 5 to 25 percent by volume of calcium carbonate concretions 5 to 20 mm in diameter that occur within 15 to 40 inches of the surface.\nThe BC horizon has the same color and reaction range as the lower part of the Bt horizon and includes hue of 5YR in some subhorizons.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam."

Caspiana soils have hue of 5YR and 2.5YR in the argillic horizon.  Catoosa soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Dardanelle and Mason soils lack carbonate concretions.  Deepwater soils formed in shale residuum and loess and have coarse fragments in the lower part of the solum.  Lula soils have limestone bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Tiptonville soils are more acid throughout. Gallion and Rilla soils do not have a mollic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients range from 0 to 1 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous silty alluvium of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is warm and humid.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 45 to 55 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 68 to 74."
