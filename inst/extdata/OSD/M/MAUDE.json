These are usually moist. The 10- to 40- inch control section is loam or very fine-sandy loam and contains 5 to 30 percent coarse fragments. The soils range from slightly acid to strongly acid. The umbric epipedon is thicker than 20 inches. Content of pyroclastic material (ash) exceeds 60 percent. These soils are massive in all parts. Depth to glacial till ranges from 30 to 45 inches.\nThe A horizon has dry value of 3 or 4, and dry chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B horizon has dry values of 4 or 5, and dry chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are very fine sandy loam, gravelly loam or gravelly very fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has dry value of 4 through 6, and dry chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are very fine sandy loam, gravelly very fine sandy loam or very gravelly loam. Skellock and Steiger soils lack umbric epipedons."
