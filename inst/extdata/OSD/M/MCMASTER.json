Total volume of rock fragments averages more than 35 percent in the particle-size control section. Depth to redoximorphic features ranges from 61 to 102 centimeters. Gravel content ranges from 10 to 25 percent in the A, E, and Bhs horizons and from 20 to 60 percent in the 2Bs, 2BC and 2C horizons. Cobbles range from 5 to 25 percent and stones range from 0 to 2 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is cobbly or gravelly sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is the cobbly or gravelly analogues of loamy sand or sandy loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is gravelly, cobbly, or very cobbly analogs of sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe 2Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is very cobbly or very gravelly loamy sand. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. It is extremely gravelly coarse sand or very cobbly coarse sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4.
