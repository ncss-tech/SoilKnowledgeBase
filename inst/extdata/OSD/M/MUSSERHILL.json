The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from mid July to mid October.  The soil temperature at 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from early March to late December and exceeds 47 degrees F from early May to late November.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral. The particle-size control section contains 35 to 75 percent rock fragments, (30 to 55 percent pebbles and 5 to 25 percent cobbles.  The particle-size control section has a ratio of extractable iron plus gibbsite to clay of greater than 0.2; and there is less than 90 percent quartz, and less than 40 percent of any single mineral.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 10YR 4/4, 5/4, or 5YR 4/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 5YR 3/4, or 10YR 3/4.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 4/4, 5/6, 5/4, 4/6, 7.5YR 4/6, 4/4, 3/4, or 2.5YR 4/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 4/6, 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, or 4/6.  It is very gravelly clay loam, extremely cobbly clay loam, or extremely gravelly clay loam.  Base saturation ranges from 75 to 85 percent by sum of cations."
