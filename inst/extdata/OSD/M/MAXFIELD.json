  "REVDATE": "09/2016",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Maxfield series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in 60 to 102 centimeters of loess and underlying glacial till. Maxfield soils are on interfluves and on head slopes of broad, shallow drainageways on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 880 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
