The soils are usually continuously dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days during the summer.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is dominantly silt loam or loam and contains less than 35 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon of most pedons is noncalcareous but is slightly calcareous in some pedons\n.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry and 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam or silt loam, and has few or common angular stones and cobbles.  It has has 15 to 35 percent calcium carbonate and has an upper boundary at depths of 6 to 14 inches.\nThe R horizon has a thin to thick coating of calcium carbonate on the surface and in cracks and pores."
