  "OVERVIEW": "The Mec series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium weathered from sandstone. These soils are on hillslopes. Slopes are 15 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.0 degree C.",
