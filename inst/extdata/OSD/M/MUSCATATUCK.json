  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Muscatatuck soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of dissected till plains and in sinkholes. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Muscatatuck soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess, pedisediment, drift and the underlying residuum from limestone. The till is considered to be from the Illinoian or pre-Illinioian stage. Indurated limestone bedrock is typically within a depth of 39 to 49 meters (12 to 15 feet). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (51 to 57 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days.  Elevation is 107 to 259 meters (350 to 850 feet)."

The moderately deep, fine Caneyville soils are typically on backslopes of hills underlain with limestone. The well drained Cincinnati and the moderately well drained Nabb soils are on slightly higher lying shoulders and backslopes of till plains. The deep, well drained Grayford soils and the very deep, well drained Ryker soils are generally on similar landform positions as Muscatatuck soils."
