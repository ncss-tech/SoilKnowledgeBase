  "OVERVIEW": "The Mocarey series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slow permeable soils. These nearly level soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Beaumont Formation. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 20.6 degrees C (69 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1397 mm (55 in).",
