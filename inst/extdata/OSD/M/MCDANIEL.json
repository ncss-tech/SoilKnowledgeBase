  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 47 to 52 degrees F. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days during the summer and the autumn. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches and may include part of the argillic horizon. The upper 7 to 20 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 0.9 percent, and 15-bar water of 5 to 10 percent for air-dried samples. The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay by weight in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry. Organic matter is estimated to range from 2 to 5 percent. It has 10 to 50 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones.\nThe 2BAt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is very gravelly clay loam, very cobbly clay loam, very gravelly silty clay loam, very cobbly silty clay loam, very gravelly loam, or very gravelly silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly silty clay loam, very cobbly silty clay loam, extremely cobbly silty clay loam, extremely gravelly clay loam, extremely gravelly silty clay loam, very cobbly clay loam, extremely cobbly clay loam, very gravelly loam, or extremely gravelly loam."

Ackna soils have a coarse textured 4BC horizon at a depth of 40 to 60 inches and are dry for 90 to 100 consecutive days. Blint, Hovelton, Leidl, Nint, and Norod soils are less than 40 inches to a lithic contact. Millhouse soils have 20 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are 20 to 40 inches to an extremely gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly sand, or extremely cobbly loamy sand. Brysill soils have a coarse textured 3BC horizon at depths of 40 to 60 inches and are dry for 100 to 120 consecutive days. Bunselmeier soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to unweathered cinders with about 5 percent sandy loam mineral soil filling interstices. Cubhill soils are dominated by rock fragments of glacial till origin and are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days. Hehe soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to weathered bedrock. Lainand soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a lithic contact. Skooker soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact."

These soils formed in colluvium from basalt or welded tuff, and loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface. The soils have a climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 19 inches. The mean January temperature is about 27 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 46 to 49 degrees F. The frost free season is 100 to 135 days."
