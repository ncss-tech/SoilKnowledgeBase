  "OVERVIEW": "The Minneopa series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on low stream terraces, flood plains, and outwash plains.  They formed in a outwash sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates typically is 16 to 50 inches.  Depth to textures of loamy sand or coarser is less than 22 inches.  These soils have 0 to 35 percent of rock fragments.  The coarse fragments are mostly less than 5 mm in size although some pedons may have as much as 5 percent cobbles in the lower part of the profile.  The series control section average more than 50 percent fine sand. The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or fine sandy loam., but ranges to loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  It ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has a matrix hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma is 2 in the upper part and 2 or 3 in the lower part.  Mottles are in the lower part of this horizon in some pedons.  The Bw horizon is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand or their gravelly analogues.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles are in this horizon in some pedons. It is sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or their gravelly analogues.  It is typically mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline, but ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."
