  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are more than 4 feet thick to the bottom of the Bt horizons. The soils contain 20 to 35 percent rock fragments throughout. The mollic epipedons are less than 20 inches thick and organic matter decreases regularly or reaches levels of less than 0.5 percent within depth of 50 inches. Mean annual soil temperature at depth of about 20 inches is less than 47 degrees F., average summer soil temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F. Clay mineralogy is mixed but vermiculite is a significant component. The soils are not usually dry, but are dry in the 7 to 20 inch section for more than 45 consecutive days. They range from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or 2. It is sandy loam or cobbly sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam with 20 to 50 percent angular gravel and cobbles.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam or sandy loam and contains 15 to 30 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam or fine sandy loam, with more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand and contains 20 to 50 percent cobble and gravel. This horizon has weak to strong angular and subangular blocky structure. The lower Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is loam or sandy loam, with 30 to 50 percent angular gravel and cobbles."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McPhie soils are at elevations of 5,000 to 7,200 feet on strongly sloping to very steep mountain slopes with slope gradients of 6 to 60 percent. The lower elevations are dominantly on northerly facing slopes. The soils formed in alluvium or colluvium, derived from intermediate igneous, granite, and minor amounts of sedimentary parent rocks. The climate is moist subhumid, having a mean annual temperature of 45 degrees F, and average summer temperature of 60 to 65 degrees F, and an average annual precipitation of 20 to 25 inches. Growing season is 80 to 90 days."
