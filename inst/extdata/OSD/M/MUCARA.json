  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness range from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to fractured volcanic bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, by volume, throughout the profile.  Content of pebbles range from 0 to 15 percent, by volume, throughout.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, clay loam or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon has no dominant color and is multicolored in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  The original rock structure is visible and weathered rock fragments can be easily broken between fingers.  Low chroma mottles appear to have been inherited from the parent material and are not due to wetness.  Texture is loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Cr horizon is composed of semi-consolidated and slightly weathered of volcanic rock.  It can be excavated with difficulty with hand tools, and is rippable by mechanical equipment."

The average annual temperature ranges from 75 to 79 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 43 to 73 inches."
