  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are calcareous in all parts.  Depth to mottles is less than 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is between 59 degrees and 71 degrees F.  The average clay content of the 10 to 40 inch control Section is between 18 and 28 percent and there is less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand.  The A horizon is pale brown, light brownish gray or pale olive in hue of 10YR through 5Y.  It is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon has slight to strong effervescence and is moderately alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.2).  The B2 horizon is light brownish gray or light olive gray in hue of 10YR through 5Y; moist chroma is 2 or less, and mottling is distinct and prominent.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon has slight to strong effervescence and is moderately alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.2)."
