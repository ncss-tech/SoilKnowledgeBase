  "OVERVIEW": "The Mollet series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from fine grained igneous rocks. These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, hills, and mountains. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
