  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F. The solum ranges from 4 to 26 inches thick. Average particle size of the control section has less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragment content in the control section ranges from 35 to 80 percent and is dominantly gravel size.  Reaction increases with depth, ranging from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nAn Oe horizon, 2 to 4 inches thick, is present in some pedons.\nThe E horizon has hue ranging from 5YR through 10YR, value moist from 3 to 6, and chroma moist from 1 to 3.  Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include very fine sandy loam, loam, or sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 10 percent with 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobble.\nThe Bhs horizons have hue ranging from 2.5YR to 10YR, value moist of 2 or 3, and chroma moist from 0 to 3.  Texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to include loam and sandy loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 35 to 65 percent and is dominantly gravel.  Prominent or distinct mottles are commonly present in the lower part of the horizon.\nA mottled Bs or BC horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue ranging from 5YR to 5Y, value moist from 3 to 5, and chroma moist from 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam or loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 50 percent with 25 to 40 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobble.  Prominent mottles may be present."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mitkof soils are on straight to concave slopes of mountainsides, hillsides, and till plains.  These soils are formed in colluvium and ablation till of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is humid maritime with a mean annual precipitation range of 60 to 220 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 57 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 0 to 3000 feet."

Kaikli and Maybeso soils are very poorly drained organic soils.  Kasiana soils have a histic epipedon and are poorly drained.  Kupreanof and Tolstoi soils are well drained with Tolstoi being thinner than 20 inches to bedrock."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile include: an albic horizon from 0 to 1 inch; a spodic horizon from 1 to 18 inches; a cryic temperature regime; assumed greater than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon; weighted average particle size of loamy-skeletal from 10 to 40 inches.\nThis series could classify as a Typic Cryaquod under the 1991 revised Spodosol criteria.  The soil, however, does not exhibit the saturated conditions typical of an Aquod which is reflected in terms of forest productivity.  Redoximorphic features are present lower in the spodic horizon and the soil exhibits characteristics of somewhat poor drainage.   It is assumed the soil is not saturated to the surface nor does the capillary fringe extend to the surface during the year.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  No laboratory data is available for this soil.  NSSL Laboratory data from similar soils (82P 3229-3235, 3236-3241) in the area show greater than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon with chromas as high as 4.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
