  "OVERVIEW": "The Morocco series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash, glaciolacustrine, or eolian deposits on outwash plains, lake plains and dunes. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 in), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

Algansee soils have textural stratification in the lower part of the series control section. Altmar soils have more than 7 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Birchwood soils have a densic contact within the series control section. Brems and Elnora, soils do not have iron depletions within a depth of 61 cm (24 in). Brockatonorton soils have a buried histic epipedon within the series control section. Deerfield and Morocco soils have overlapping soils properties and are not clearly differentiated from one another, however Deerfield soils have a depth to iron depletions ranging in excess of 61 cm (24 in).   Fortress soils have a B horizon that is less than 25 cm (10 inches) thick. Livonia soils have slightly acid to moderately alkaline reaction. Meckling soils are calcareous throughout. Ottokee soils have lamella within the series control section. Partridge soils have a lithic contact between a depth of 51 and 102 cm (20 and 40 in). Succotash soils do not have a B horizon. Tedrow soils are less acidic that moderately acid in the lower part of the series control section. Zaborosky soils have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 in)."
