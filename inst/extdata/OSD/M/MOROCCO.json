Algansee soils have textural stratification in the lower part of the series control section. Altmar soils have more than 7 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Birchwood soils have a densic contact within the series control section. Brems and Elnora, soils do not have iron depletions within a depth of 61 cm (24 in). Brockatonorton soils have a buried histic epipedon within the series control section. Deerfield and Morocco soils have overlapping soils properties and are not clearly differentiated from one another, however Deerfield soils have a depth to iron depletions ranging in excess of 61 cm (24 in).   Fortress soils have a B horizon that is less than 25 cm (10 inches) thick. Livonia soils have slightly acid to moderately alkaline reaction. Meckling soils are calcareous throughout. Ottokee soils have lamella within the series control section. Partridge soils have a lithic contact between a depth of 51 and 102 cm (20 and 40 in). Succotash soils do not have a B horizon. Tedrow soils are less acidic that moderately acid in the lower part of the series control section. Zaborosky soils have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 in)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Morocco soils are on footslopes on outwash plains, low rises on lake plains, and low ridges and dunes on dune fields. Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent. Morocco soils formed in sandy outwash, glaciolacustrine, or eolian deposits . The sand fraction is fine or medium sand. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 107 cm (30 to 42 in). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 11.7 degrees C (47 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 m (580 to 1,530 ft) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Brems soils are on higher positions on footslopes and swells. The very poorly drained Maumee and Newton soils are in depressions. The well drained Osolo soils are on slightly higher positions on swells. The excessively drained Plainfield and Tyner soils are on swells and knolls."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Soils are mostly used to grow corn, soybeans, and wheat. Irrigation is a common practice on cropped areas. Some areas are in pasture or forest. Native vegetation is hardwood forest with northern red oak and pin oak the principal species.  White pine is also a common species in MLRA 97."
