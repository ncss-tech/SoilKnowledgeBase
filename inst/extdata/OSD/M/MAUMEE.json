  "OVERVIEW": "The Maumee series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash or sandy sediments in depressions on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

The very poorly drained Adrian and Houghton soils formed in organic material and are in deeper depressions. The moderately well drained Brems and Denham soils are on swells. The excessively drained Chelsea, Oakville, and Plainfield soils and the somewhat excessively drained Coloma soils are on higher lying swells and dunes. The somewhat poorly drained Morocco and Watseka soils are on swells on outwash plains."
