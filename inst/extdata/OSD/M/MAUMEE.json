Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1041 mm (30 to 41 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

The Granby and Gilford soils and the very poorly drained Newton soils are on similar landforms nearby. The Gilford soils are coarse-loamy and the Newton soils have an umbric horizon. The very poorly drained Adrian and Houghton soils formed in organic material and are in deeper depressions. The moderately well drained Brems and Denham soils are on swells. The excessively drained Chelsea, Oakville, and Plainfield soils and the somewhat excessively drained Coloma soils are on higher lying swells and dunes. The somewhat poorly drained Morocco and Watseka soils are on swells on outwash plains."
