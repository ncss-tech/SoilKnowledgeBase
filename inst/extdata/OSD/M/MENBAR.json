  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon (Cumulic feature) - from 0 to 20 inches (A1, A2, and A3 horizons); an irregular decrease in organic carbon is inferred from the stratification.\nAquic conditions and endosaturation - in the layers below 20 inches; inferred from redox concentration and chroma of 2 in part. This conflicts with the original depth to water table, but that depth is presumed over-estimated (too deep).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (part of A3 and C horizons)\nSeries control section - The zone from 0 to 60 inches.\nSoil temperature data are from a 10 year record one mile from type location on a similar soil. When established the Menbar series was classified as fine-loamy, mixed Cumulic Cryoborolls.\nTaxonomic version: Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
