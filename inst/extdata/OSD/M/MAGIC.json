    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and thickness of the solum are 25 to 40 inches.  The soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches is moist in some part in October or early November and remains moist until July.  Mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 degrees to 65 degrees F.\nThe profile is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The soil has cracks that are 1 to 4 cm. wide and 50 to 60 cm. deep in the summer and autumn of most years.  The upper part of the profile has 0 to 3 percent stones, 3 to 5 percent cobbles and 3 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe B horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  This horizon is weakly to strongly effervescent in the lower part."

They formed in a Humid continental climate, cool summers (Trewartha's modified Koppen system) having dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Mean January temperature is 15 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 66 degrees F.; and mean annual temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 70 to 100 days."

Manard and Polecreek soils have medium textured surfaces and fine textured B2t horizons."
