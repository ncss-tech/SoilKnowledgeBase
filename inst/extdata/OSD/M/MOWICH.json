  "OVERVIEW": "The Mowich series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glaciolacustrine sediments.  These soils are on preglacial lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 65 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

The spodic horizon is assumed not to meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon, but is assumed to have silt-sized and larger pellets and cracked coatings on sand grains."
