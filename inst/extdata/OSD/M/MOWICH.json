These soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glaciolacustrine sediments associated with Pleistocene valley glaciation.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The climate is marine influenced, with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 55 to 75 inches, which includes an average 4 feet snowfall.  Mean January temperature is about 31 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 150 to 170 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 7 inches, a sodic horizon from 7 to 26 inches, and a lithologic change from weathered volcanic ash to glacial lake sediments at 26 inches.  The spodic horizon is assumed not to meet chemical criteria for a spodic horizon, but is assumed to have silt-sized and larger pellets and cracked coatings on sand grains.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
