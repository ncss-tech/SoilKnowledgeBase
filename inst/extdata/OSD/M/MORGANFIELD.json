  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil commonly ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline throughout.  Less commonly, some pedons have strata in the C horizon that are strongly to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt, silt loam, or loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some pedons below a depth of 40 inches have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less.  Texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Brownish mottles, if present, are few to common.  In some pedons the lower part of the C horizon has few to common grayish and brownish mottles at a depth of 20 inches.  The 10- to 40-inch control section has from 5 to 18 percent clay, and the total sand content ranges from 5 to 45 percent.  Some pedons have a buried A horizon below a depth of 20 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Roxana is the only other series in the same family.  Closely related series include the Ariel, Bunyan, Caruthersville, Congaree, Norwood, Oklared, Robinsonville, Severn, Toccoa, Velda, and Vicksburg soils.  Roxana soils have hue of 7.5 YR or redder.  Ariel and Velda soils do not have thin horizontal strata and are very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Also, Velda soils have siliceous mineralogy.  Bunyan soils have a fine-loamy particle-size class.  Caruthersville and Severn soils are calcareous.  Congaree soils have a fine-loamy particle-size class.  Norwood soils have a fine-silty particle-size class and are calcareous.  Oklared, Robinsonville, and Toccoa have a coarse-loamy particle-size class; also, Oklared soils are calcareous.  Vicksburg soils have an acid reaction class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The soil formed in thick silty alluvial deposits along streams that drain areas of the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Area.  Mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Adler and Convent series.  Adler soils, which have mottles with chroma of 2 at a depth of less than 20 inches, are in similar positions and slightly lower positions than the Morganfield soils.  Convent soils, which are wetter and have mottles with chroma of 2 or less below the Ap horizon, are in lower parts of the floodplains."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Nearly all areas of this soil are cleared and used for growing cotton, corn, soybeans, and small grains.  A moderate acreage is used for pasture and hay crops.  The native vegetation was bottomland hardwoods including eastern cottonwood, green ash, nuttall oak, sweetgum, water oak, yellow poplar, and American sycamore, and, in places, cane brakes."
