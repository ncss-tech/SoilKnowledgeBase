  "OVERVIEW": "The Manuelito series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Manuelito soils are on summits, shoulders, and footslopes of plateaus. Slopes are 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
