  "OVERVIEW": "The Meadowpass series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that are 20 to 40 inches deep over welded tuff bedrock.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from semi-consolidated welded tuff.  These soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
