  "OVERVIEW": "The Motley series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping dissected stream terraces on alluvial plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",
