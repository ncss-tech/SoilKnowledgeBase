The series classification was revised from fine-loamy, mixed, active, thermic Udic Paleustolls to fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, thermic Typic Paleustolls in 2004 based on soil properties and updates to Soil Taxonomy.  These soils have been included in the Miles series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 17 inches. (A & Bt1 horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 9 to 84 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4, & Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 56 to 84 inches.
