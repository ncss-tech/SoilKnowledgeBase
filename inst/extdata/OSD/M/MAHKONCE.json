    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates typically is 21 to 30 inches but ranges from 15 to 40 inches.  Volume of rock fragments, of mixed lithology, ranges from 1 to 8 percent throughout the profile.  Cole values are 5.0 to 5.9 in the upper 40 inches of the profile.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  The percent clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent in the upper part and 30 to 45 percent in the lower part. Clay films are faint to distinct, and few to continuous with chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline. Clay films are typically on ped faces or in pores.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Mahkonce soils are on nearly level or gently sloping slopes on glacial moraines.  The slope gradients range from 0 to 4 percent.  The soils primarily formed in calcareous glacial till of Late Wisconsin Age.  Evidence suggests there has been differential sorting of this till from ice melting, accounting for the silty and clayey nature of some pedons.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 25 inches.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days.  Elevation is about 1150 to 1600 feet."
