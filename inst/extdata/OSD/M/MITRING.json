  "OVERVIEW": "The Mitring series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed of residuum and colluvium weathered from extrusive igneous rocks.  The Mitring soils are on foothills and ridges.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 15 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and average annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
