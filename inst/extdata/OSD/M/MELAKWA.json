The Melakwa soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice mixed with colluvium from andesite, and breccia.  The climate is marine influenced with relatively cool, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 90 to 130 inches, with a large portion of this in the form of snow.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 160 days."
