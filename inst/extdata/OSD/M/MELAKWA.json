  "OVERVIEW": "The Melakwa series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice mixed with colluvium from andesite and breccia.  Melakwa soils are on ridge crests and sideslopes at elevations of 1,600 to 2,800 feet.  Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent.  Average annual  precipitation is about 110 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 44 degrees  F.",

Average annual precipitation ranges from 90 to 130 inches, with a large portion of this in the form of snow.  The mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 160 days."
