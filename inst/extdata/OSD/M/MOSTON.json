Maxinkuckee and Wawayanda soils have less than 70 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Muskego soils do not have sand within 130 cm (51 inches) of the surface. Toto soils have a layer of marly material below the coprogenous material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Moston soils are in shallow closed depressions primarily on outwash plains, lake plains, lake terraces, and flood plains, but can occur within moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Moston soils formed in herbaceous organic material over coprogenous material (sedimentary peat) and sand deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

These very poorly drained soils are on similar landform positions as Moston soils. Adrian and Antung soils formed in herbaceous organic deposits over sandy material. Edselton soils have marly material underlying the herbaceous organic deposits. Edwards, Madaus, and Martisco soils formed in herbaceous organic deposits over marly material. Houghton soils formed in herbaceous organic deposits more than 130 cm (51 inches) thick. Muskego soils do not have sand within 130 cm (51 inches) of the soil surface. Toto soils formed in herbaceous organic deposits over coprogenous material, marly material, and sand."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Depth to the top of an apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface for some time in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the herbaceous organic material, moderately low in the coprogenous material (sedimentary peat), and high or very high in the underlying sand. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid in the herbaceous organic material, slow in the coprogenous material (sedimentary peat), and rapid in the underlying sand."

The typical pedon site is about 225 feet east of this pedon. Transect data (T98IN-131-219) for the typical pedon is on file in the MLRA project office in Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 80 percent Moston soils and 20 percent Houghton soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
