Montgomery soils formed in fine-textured lacustrine sediments. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from\n11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches.) Frost free days are 150 to 210."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Booker, Kings, Markland, McGary, Shircliff and Zipp soils on lake plains. The very poorly drained Booker and Kings soils are in the smectitic mineralogy class, and are on depressions. The well drained Markland soils and moderately well drained Shircliff soils are on summits, shoulders and backslopes of dissected lake plains. The somewhat poorly drained McGary soils are on flats. The very poorly drained, lighter colored Zipp soils are in depressions and on flats."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained or very poorly drained. The potential for surface water runoff ranges from negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers/s). Permeability is slow. In undrained areas, depth to an intermittent apparent high water table is from 0.3 meters (1 foot) above the soil surface to 0.15 meters (0.5 foot) below the soil surface from November through June in most years. In drained areas, depth to an intermittent apparent high water table is from 0.3 meters (1 foot) above the soil surface to 0.3 meters (1 foot) below the soil surface from December through April in most years. Where this soil is on flood-plain steps, it is subject to rare to frequent periods of flooding."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series has been correlated in MLRA's 94B, 99, 110, and 111. As soil surveys are updated in these MLRA's, the Montgomery series will be evaluated and correlated to series that are appropriate to those regions.  The Vertic subgroup classification is considered tentative as it could be in the Typic subgroup.  This will be investigated as more data is collected for this series.  Undrained, drained, flooded and gravelly substratum phases are recognized, and the gravelly substratum phase may become a new series when the soil survey subsets with this phase are updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 1) mollic epipedon: the zone from 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 inches) (Ap, A horizons); 2) Cambic horizon: the zone from 38 to 97 cm (15 to 38 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 horizons); 3) Redox features - chroma of 2 or less immediately below the mollic epipedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data available from Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University: S60IN28-4 (typical pedon), S60IN28-3, S80IN175-1, and S79IN125-17.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
