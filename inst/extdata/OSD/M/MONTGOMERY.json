  "OVERVIEW": "The Montgomery series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in fine-textured lacustrine sediments. These soils are dominantly on lake plains and to a lesser extent on slack water flood-plain steps. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches).",

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or moderately low (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers/s). Permeability is slow. In undrained areas, depth to an intermittent apparent high water table is from 0.3 meters (1 foot) above the soil surface to 0.15 meters (0.5 foot) below the soil surface from November through June in most years. In drained areas, depth to an intermittent apparent high water table is from 0.3 meters (1 foot) above the soil surface to 0.3 meters (1 foot) below the soil surface from December through April in most years. Where this soil is on flood-plain steps, it is subject to rare to frequent periods of flooding."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series has been correlated in MLRA's 94B, 99, 110, and 111. As soil surveys are updated in these MLRA's, the Montgomery series will be evaluated and correlated to series that are appropriate to those regions.  The Vertic subgroup classification is considered tentative as it could be in the Typic subgroup.  This will be investigated as more data is collected for this series.  Undrained, drained, flooded and gravelly substratum phases are recognized, and the gravelly substratum phase may become a new series when the soil survey subsets with this phase are updated.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon: 1) mollic epipedon: the zone from 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 inches) (Ap, A horizons); 2) Cambic horizon: the zone from 38 to 97 cm (15 to 38 inches) (Bg1, Bg2, Bg3 horizons); 3) Redox features - chroma of 2 or less immediately below the mollic epipedon."
