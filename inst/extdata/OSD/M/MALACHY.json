  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to texture of loamy fine sand or coarser ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  These soils typically are calcareous, slightly effervescent to strongly effervescent in all parts of the series control section.  However, a few pedons have a noncalcareous, slightly alkaline A or Ap horizon.  A calcic horizon occurs below a depth of 16 inches.  The upper mantle contains 0 to 10 percent rock fragments and the 2C horizon has 0 to 20 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 24 inches thick.  The sand size fraction in the particle-size control section is of mixed lithology.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or very fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an AB horizon.\nThe Bw and Bk horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, but in some pedons is 3 in the upper part and chroma of 2 to 4.  They typically have faint to distinct redox features in the lower part.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  The main part has weak fine or medium prismatic structure or weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a thin 2B horizon with texture of loamy sand, loamy find sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Some have reddish or brownish colored bands. It commonly has faint to prominent redoximorphic features.  It is coarse sand, sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand or their gravelly analogues.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or slightly convex slopes with gradient of 0 to 3 percent on glacial lake or outwash plains. They formed in 24 to 40 inches of coarse-loamy sediments over sandy sediments, both glacial outwash or lacustrine origin.  These sediments are Late Wisconsin in age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 44 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 28 inches.   Frost-free days range from 120 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 900 to 1950 feet."

The Sverdrup soils are well drained and are on higher lying or more sloping terrain.  The Clontarf soils are moderately well drained and are on a slightly higher terrain.  Both of the soils have free carbonates at greater depths.  The Arveson soils are poorly drained, have a calcic horizon beginning at shallow depths, and are on lower lying terrain."
