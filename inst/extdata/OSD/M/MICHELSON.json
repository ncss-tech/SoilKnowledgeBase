  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 38 to 100 cm. Gravel, cobbles, and some stones occur on and in the soil pedon, ranging from 5 to 40 percent of volume in the A horizon, 5 to 15 percent of volume above a minimum depth of 76 cm, and from 35 to 80 percent of volume below a maximum depth of 102 cm. Base saturation ranges from 85 to 100 percent. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C. The average summer soil temperature ranges from 11 to 15 degrees C. The average winter soil temperature is about -6 degrees C. Soil temperature at 50 cm is warmer than 5 degrees C. from about May 15 to November 1. The soils are dry to 50 cm for about 40 cumulative days during the growing season. The mollic epipedon ranges from 18 to 28 cm thick and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It is heavy loam to light clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and 30 to 40 percent silt plus very fine sand. It is neutral to slightly alkaline (pH 6.6 to 7.8).\nThe 2Bk1, 2Bk2, and 3Bk3 horizons, have hues of 2.5Y through 2.5YR, values of 6 through 8 dry and 4 through 6 moist and chromas of 3 through 6. They have 15 to 45 percent CaC03 equivalent.\nThe 4Btb horizon of the typifying pedon occurs at depths greater than 102 cm and extends below 152 cm in most pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Michelson soils are on the nearly level to gently sloping, high, old terraces and their sloping sides. They formed in old alluvium from Cretaceous shales and quartzites and argillite rocks. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 7 degrees C., mean summer air temperature ranges from 13 to 15 degrees C. and mean winter temperature is -7 or -6 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 381 to 610 mm, most of which falls in spring, summer and fall months of May through September. Annual snowfall ranges from 1270 to 3810 mm."
