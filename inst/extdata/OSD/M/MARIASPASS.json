  "OVERVIEW": "The Mariaspass series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and/or colluvium over residuum derived from shale. These soils are on structural benches and mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,000 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.0 degrees C.",
