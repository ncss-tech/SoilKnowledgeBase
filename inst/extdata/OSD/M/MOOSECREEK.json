  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to free calcium carbonate range from 14 to 30 inches.  The rock fragment content is 0 to 10 percent in the loamy mantle and ranges from 10 to 35 percent in the underlying sediments.\nAn A horizon is as much as 4 inches thick in uncultivated pedons.  The A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Dry values are 5 or less.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a thin (less than 4 inches thick) B/E transitional horizon with characteristics of both the B and E horizons.  The eluvial part comprises less than 15 percent of this horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  The percent clay averages from 18 to 30 percent, but includes 15 to 35 percent clay in some part of the Bt horizons.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  The fine earth fraction is sand and coarse sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon with similar ranges as the 2Bk, except there is not an accumulation of carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moosecreek soils are on nearly level to sloping areas on outwash plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  These soils formed in a mantle of loamy glacial till underlain by stratified sandy and gravelly glacial outwash.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 27 inches.  Frost free period ranges from 90 to 130 days.  Elevation ranges from 1200 to 2000 feet."

Karlstad soils are moderately well drained and are on nearly level to slightly convex positions on the landscape.  Lengby and Sugarbush soils are on sideslopes and hilltops.  Also, Sugarbush has less than 18 percent clay in the argillic.  Lengby formed in stratified sandy and silty deposits."
