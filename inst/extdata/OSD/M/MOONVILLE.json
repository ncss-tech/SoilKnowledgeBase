The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 66 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 20 to 35 inches.  Phosphate retention is 50 to 80 percent.  Acid-oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 1.0 to 2.0.  Glass percent is 5 to 30 percent.  the 15-bar water on air dried samples is 12 to 15 percent and 20 to 30 percent on moist samples.  Field estimated clay content is 12 to 26 percent. The soil profile contains 2 to 10 percent cinder gravels throughout.\nThe A horizon has color value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.  It ranges from weak fine and medium platy to weak or moderate fine and medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has color value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 7 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.  It has weak to moderate, fine or medium, subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bk is moderately or strongly calcareous.  Calcium carbonate is 15 to 35 percent."
