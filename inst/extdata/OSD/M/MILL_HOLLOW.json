  "REVDATE": "01/2004",
  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mill Hollow series consists of soils formed in deep alluvium from basalt.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep alluvial fans, mountain slopes and rolling hills.  Slopes are 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

These soils are dry in the moisture control section more than 50 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. and are continually dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days during the summer months is  more than 6 out of 10 years.\nDepth to the Ck horizons is 7 to 10 inches.  The surface ranges in rock fragments from few to more than 50 percent, mainly cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has weak thin platy to weak fine granular structure.  This horizon is slightly calcareous to noncalcareous.\nThe Ck horizon to a depth of about 34 inches is brown, pale brown or white.  Value is 5 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma is 2 or 3.  Stony or extremely stony loam may occur below about 34 inches."
