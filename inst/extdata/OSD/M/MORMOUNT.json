  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mormount soils are on fan piedmont remnants.  The exposed petrocalcic horizon is as thick as 20 feet in some pedons. These soils formed in alluvium predominantly from limestone and minor amounts of volcanic tuffs. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 3500 to 4500 feet. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, intermittently moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 57 to 62 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 190 to 210 days."
