  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mata series consists of soils that are deep to mudstone bedrock.  These well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in the Uvalde Gravel overlying mudstone.  They are nearly level to gently sloping soils on noseslopes and summits of interfluves.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches.",
