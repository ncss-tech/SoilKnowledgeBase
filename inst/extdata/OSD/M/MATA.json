(A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: 64 to 137 cm (25 to 54 in).  (Bk and Bkz horizons)\nDensic contact: The contact with mudstone bedrock at 137 cm (54 in). (2Cdyz horizon)\nLithologic discontinuity: At the upper boundary of the 2Cdyz horizon.\nMottles in the 2Cdyz horizon are considered to be lithochromic.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from surrounding counties in the region.  Laboratory data from La Salle County is inconclusive.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  TAMU Soil Characterization Laboratory data from 2 pedons in La Salle County, Texas (S85TX-283-01; S85TX-283-02).
