  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone ranges from 20 to 40 inches but there are solution pits to 60 or more inches deep within the pedon.  Texture is sand or fine sand in all major horizons.  Soil temperature is 73  to 75 degrees F. at a depth of 20 inches below the soil surface.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Soil reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The Bw2 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of\n4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has a 1 to 3 percent increase in clay content.  It is cyclic and is too discontinuous or thin to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.  In the deeper solution pits the B horizon is thicker and finer textured and may qualify for an argillic horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is variable ranging from fine sand to sandy clay loam mixed with fragments of hard limestone and/or\nsoft carbonate material.  Solution holes in the limestone range from about 6 inches to 3 feet in diameter and occur at intervals of about 2 to 6 feet."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is Captiva in the same family and Basinger, Hallandale, Lachoochee, Plantation, and Pompano series.  Basinger and Pompano soils are 80 or more inches thick.  Hallandale soils have fractured limestone at depths less than 20 inches. Lachoochee soils are subject to tidal flooding and are calcareous.  Plantation soils have 8 inches or more of organic materials on the surface of the mineral soil."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Margate soils are on nearly level, low terraces between the Everglades and the low, sandy coastal ridges.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  These soils have formed in a thin\nto moderately thick bed of sandy marine sediments over limestone under the influence of a high water table.  The climate is humid and warm.  Near the type location, the average annual\nprecipitation is about 63 inches and mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F."

Boca soils have an argillic horizon. Sanibel and Immokalee soils are more than 80 inches thick.  In addition, Immokalee soils have a spodic horizon and are on slightly higher elevations."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; very slow runoff; rapid permeability.  In undrained areas, the water table is within l0 inches of the soil surface for 2 to 4 months or shallow water covers the soil for l to 4 months during most years.  In drained areas, the water table fluctuates with the water level in the canals and ditches through the solution holes in the limestone."

In their native state, these soils are used for rangeland and as a wildlife habitat.\nNative vegetation consists of waxmyrtle, pineland threeawn, St.  Johnswort, and scattered cypress."
