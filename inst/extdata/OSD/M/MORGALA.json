    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The ochric epipedon ranges from 4 to 15 inches thick and has moist value of 3 throughout. The combined thickness of the Al, B2t, and B3t horizons is more than 60 inches. The upper 25 to 44 inches is noncalcareous. me mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 45 to 41 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 66 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 50 to 85 consecutive days during the late summer. Rock fragments are rounded sandstone cobbles and pebbles, and range from 0 to 15 percent in the Al horizon, 5 to 15 percent in the upper part of the B2t horizon, and from 0 to 25 percent in the lower B2t and B3t horizons.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 6 dry and moist. It ranges from loam to light clay loam. This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist. It ranges from heavy silty clay loam or heavy clay loam to clay and has estimated 35 to 42 percent clay. Structure is moderate or strong, medium subangular blocky or prismatic. Clay films are many to continuous, thin to moderately thick. Cracks of 1 cm. to 1/2 inch are present when dry. The B2t horizon is neutral to mildly alkaline and is noncalcareous in the upper part but ranges to moderately calcareous in the lower part. It is 25 to 40 inches thick. me B3t horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 are 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 through 8 dry and 6 moist. It ranges from silty clay loam, clay loam, or clay to gravelly silty clay loam or gravelly clay loam. Clay films are many to continuous, thin.  This horizon is slightly to strongly calcareous and moderately to strongly alkaline."
