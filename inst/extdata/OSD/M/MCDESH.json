  "OVERVIEW": "The McDesh series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils with slow permeability that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from basalt and welded tuff. Slopes range from 4 to 65 percent in foothills. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
