Okee soils contain less than 24 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Ormas soils contain more than 10 percent gravel in the lower part of the argillic horizon and are underlain by gravelly or very gravelly sand.

Metea soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of wind or water laid sandy material and the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days. Elevation is 183 to 466 meters (600 to 1,530 feet) above mean sea level."

The poorly drained Barry and Brookston soils and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Rensselaer soils are in depressions of glaciated uplands. The excessively drained Chelsea and Plainfield soils, and the well drained Spinks soils are on summits and backslopes of glaciated uplands and are sandier in the lower part of the series control section. The moderately well drained Moon soils are on backslopes and have redoximorphic features within 102 cm (40 inches) of the surface. The moderately well drained Miami soils, and the well drained Owosso, Riddles, and Wawasee soils are on summits and backslopes of glaciated uplands."
