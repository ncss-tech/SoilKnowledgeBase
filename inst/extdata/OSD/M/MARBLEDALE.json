  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock are more than 60 inches. The soil ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, except layers near the surface may be less acid where the soil has been limed. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout, except the surface layer may range as high as 25 percent. Fragments are usually gravels or cobbles of sandstone, quartzite, or chert.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. A hue of 5YR may occur where the soil is significantly eroded. Texture is commonly loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam, but includes clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay, where eroded.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Mottles, when present, are in shades of brown, yellow and red. The texture is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8. It may also be profusely mottled in these colors, having no dominant matrix color. It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam. In some pedons, the BC horizon is quite massive and dense, but does not exhibit fragic characteristics."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are currently the Albertville, Badin, Brockroad, Carnasaw, Catharpin, Coghill, Corryton, Cuthbert, Kirvin, Luverne, Masada, Mayodan, McQueen, Nason, Peakin, Sweatman, Tatum, Townley, Uwharrie, and Vance series. Soils in related families include the Fluvanna, Mattaponi, Noah,\nand Williamsville series. Albertville, Carnasaw, Fluvanna, and Noah soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Badin and Townley soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Brockroad and Catharpin soils have a lithologic discontinuity at 24 to 50 inches of alluvium over residuum. Coghill soils formed in residuum from quartzose limestone, and interbedded calcareous sandstone and shale. Corryton soils formed in residuum derived from shale that is interbedded with thin seams of limestone. Cuthbert soils formed in weakly consolidated loamy, sandy and shaly materials mainly of Tertiary age. Kirvin soils commonly contain ironstone pebbles. Luverne soils formed in stratified marine sediments of the Southern Coastal Plain. Masada soils contain coarse fragments of quartz, quartzite, gneiss or schist and formed in old alluvium on terraces in the Southern Piedmont and Coastal Plain. Mattaponi soils formed in Coastal Plain sediments and have less than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the sand and silt fraction of the upper part of the B horizon. Mayodan and Peakin(T)soils formed in residuum from Triassic materials in the Southern Piedmont. McQueen soils are on low and intermediate stream terraces in the Southern Piedmont and Coastal Plain. Nason soils have 25 to 50 inch sola and contain quartz and schist fragments. Sweatman soils formed in marine sediments in the Southern Coastal Plain. Tatum soils contain schist fragments and have a paralithic contact with weathered schist. Uwharrie soils formed in residuum from slate, phyllite, or sericite schist in the Southern Piedmont. Vance soils have C horizons of saprolite weathered from felsic crystalline rock. More competitors will become apparent as more series are reclassified."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marbledale soils are on intermediate and high stream terraces, mainly associated with major river systems in the Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valleys (MLRA 128). Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. These soils formed in old alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, and limestone. Near the type location,\nmean annual temperature is 57.2 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 57 inches."

Waynesboro soils, in similar positions, have subsoils that remain fine-textured to a depth of 5 feet. Shady soils are on lower-lying terraces. They are brown in color, and are in a fine-loamy family."
