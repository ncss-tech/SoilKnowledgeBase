Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 67 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is 60 inches."

All of these soils have more clay in the control section and are on similar to higher positions. Angie and Boswell soils are moderately well drained. In addition, Angie soils have yellower subsoils and Boswell soils have vertic properties. The somewhat poorly drained Kipling soils have calcium carbonate concretions in the lower subsoil. Mayhew, Oktibbeha, Vaiden and Wilcox soils are Vertisols. In addition, Mayhew soils are poorly drained, Oktibbeha soils are moderately well drained, while Vaiden and Wilcox soils are somewhat poorly drained."
