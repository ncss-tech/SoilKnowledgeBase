  "OVERVIEW": "The Macon series consist of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils in the margin between the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie (MLRA 135A) and the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A) along with the Cretaceous Western Coastal Plain (MLRA 135B) Major Land Resource Areas. They formed in thick beds of loamy and clayey marine sediments. Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 67 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 60 inches. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.",
