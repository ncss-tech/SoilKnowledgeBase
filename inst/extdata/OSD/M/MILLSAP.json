  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 66 degrees F.  and the soil temperature is not less than 41 degrees F. at any time.  The soil between the depths of about 5 and 15 inches is usually dry in all parts from mid-May until mid-October and is moist in some or all parts between these depths all the rest of the year. Most pedons have less than 10 percent rock fragments in all horizons and the entire Bt horizon or the upper 20 inches always averages less than 35 percent.  Some pedons have as much as 75 percent rock fragments in the subhorizon just above the bedrock. The base saturation is 80 to 100 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, brown, light brownish gray, pale brown, or light yellowish brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 6/4). Moist colors are very dark grayish brown, dark brown, brown or dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2). Organic matter averages 0.5 to 4 percent in the upper few inches of the A horizon and decreases abruptly with depth. The dark colors have too little organic matter or are too thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon. This horizon is loam or clay loam and is slightly acid to strongly acid. Some pedons have thin cappings of uncoated grains on top of the Bt horizon or have an E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon is dark brown, grayish brown, brown, yellowish brown, light brown, or light yellowish brown (10YR 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 6/4). Moist colors are dark brown or dark yellowish brown (10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 4/4). This horizon is heavy clay loam, silty clay, clay, gravelly clay, very gravelly clay or extremely gravelly clay with 15 to 30 percent (absolute) increase in clay from the A horizon to the Bt horizon. It is neutral to moderately acid. Some pedons have BC, BCt, or C horizon without rock structure above the bedrock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cometa and Corning series in the same family and the Hillgate and San Ysidro series. None of these soils have a lithic or paralithic contact. Also, the mineralogy of Hillgate and San Ysidro soils is dominated by montmorillonite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Millsap soils are on toe slopes and mountains.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. The soils formed in material weathered from firm to hard sandstone, shale and conglomerate. Elevations are 75 to 3,000 feet. The climate is subhumid with warm to hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 30 inches. Mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F.; mean July temperature is about 74 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees to 62 degrees F. Frost-free season is about 200 to 300 days."

Gaviota, Lodo, and Millsholm soils are less than 20 inches deep to rock and lack an argillic horizon. Los Osos soils have a mollic epipedon, and lack an abrupt A/Bt horizon boundary. Sehorn soils have cracks that open to the surface, have slickensides, and lack an argillic horizon. Newville soils lack a lithic contact, have a moist value of less than 3.5, have more than 1.5 percent organic matter to a depth of more than 4 inches, and have montmorillonitic mineralogy."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nEdits were made to incorporate lab data from the CA645 manuscript as part of the SDJR initiative. - AEC\nMillsap where mapped in CA095 Solano County CA and CA664 San Louis Obispo County need to be compared with the central concept of where Millsap is mapped in the northern Coast Range foothills. In CA095 Millsap is moderately well drained and occurs on low hills. In CA664 Millsap occurs on hills and mountains influenced by the marine climate. - AEC\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
