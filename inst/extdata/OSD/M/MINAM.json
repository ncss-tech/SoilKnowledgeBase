    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F. The particle-size control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and less than 35 percent rounded or subrounded rock fragments (weighted average) and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Depth to the extremely gravelly substratum ranges from 30 to 40 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches and includes all or part of the Bw horizon. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is ashy loam or ashy silt loam with 5 to 15 percent clay. It has 0 to 20 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones. It has 20 to 30 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregate and less than 0.4 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron. Soil reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It is silt loam, loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel. Organic matter is 1 to 2 percent. Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C or 2BC horizon has colors similar to the Bw horizon. It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay. It has 15 to 45 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones. Soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Minam soils are on alluvial or pediment fans. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. They formed in mixed alluvium and colluvium with an influence of volcanic ash and loess. Elevation is 3,400 to 5,300 feet. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 30 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

Lostine soils are on lower adjacent outwash plains, terraces, and fans and are coarse-silty. Parsnip soils are on adjacent higher plateaus and have bedrock at a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Redmount soils are on adjacent lower outwash plains and are coarse-loamy. Rondowa soils are on slightly lower glacial moraines and are loamy-skeletal."
