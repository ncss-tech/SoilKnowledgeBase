    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is 24 to 48 inches. Secondary lime in the form of films and threads occurs at depths of 15 to 25 inches. Electrical conductivity is 1 to 4 dS/m in the 10- to 40-inch control section and increases with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with a clay content of 18 to 31 percent. Amount of visible segregated calcium carbonate ranges from a few films and threads to a few masses in the lower part of the horizon.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from about 15 to 35 percent and is relatively constant or increases with depth. Visible forms are films and threads, masses, or strongly cemented nodules."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Aguilares and Moglia series.  A similar soil is the Copita series. Aguilares soils have higher amounts of salts in the lower subsoil.  Moglia soils have SAR of greater than 15 within 25 inches of the soil surface.  In addition, Moglia soils have a lithologic discontinuity.  Copita soils have a paralithic contact with sandstone at depths of less than 40 inches, and have active cation exchange activity class."

The soil formed in moderately fine-textured calcareous sediments many feet thick of alluvial or eolian origin. Average annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 24 inches, mean annual temperature is about 74 degrees F., and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 21 to 30."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Use is primarily rangeland although several thousand acres are dry farmed and a few hundred acres are irrigated. The main crops are cotton and grain sorghum on dryland. Irrigated crops are cotton, grain sorghum, and some citrus. Native grasses are two- and four-flower trichloris, Alovegrass tridens, Arizona cottontop, and plains bristlegrass. Woody species include Texas ebony, mesquite, spiny hackberry, lotebush, blackbrush, cenizo, Coyotillo, lime pricklyash, and pricklypear."
