  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Midraw soils are on crests, summits, shoulders, side slopes of structural benches, plateaus, foothills, hills and mountains. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from rhyolite, andesite, basalt, and rhyolitic tuff with a component of loess and volcanic ash. Elevations are 975 to 1,895 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent. Climate is cool and semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm; mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free season is 90 to 125 days."
