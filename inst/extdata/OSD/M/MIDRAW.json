  "OVERVIEW": "The Midraw series consists of shallow over an indurated duripan, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from rhyolite, andesite, basalt, or rhyolitic tuff with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Midraw soils are on crests, summits, shoulders, side slopes of structural benches, plateaus, foothills, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
