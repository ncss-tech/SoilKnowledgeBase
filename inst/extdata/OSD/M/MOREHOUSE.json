  "OVERVIEW": "The Morehouse series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands and volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks. Morehouse are dominantly on stable dunes in basins on lakebeds. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

These soils formed in eolian sands and volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks. They are also found on lava plateaus as dunes where these soils formed in very deep deposits of eolian sands and volcanic ash.  The source of the volcanic ash is ancestral Mt. Mazama. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,475 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Horning soils have thin strata of ashy loamy texture in the particle-size control section and are influenced by diatom grains."
