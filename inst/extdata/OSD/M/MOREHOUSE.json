  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Morehouse soils are dominantly on stable dunes in basins on lakebeds. These soils formed in eolian sands and volcanic ash over lacustrine deposits derived from volcanic rocks. They are also found on lava plateaus as dunes where these soils formed in very deep deposits of eolian sands and volcanic ash.  The source of the volcanic ash is ancestral Mt. Mazama. Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,475 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 280 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

Abert and Tonor soils have ashy loamy textures in the particle-size control section and are on adjacent nearly level lakebeds that are not mantled with eolian material. Horning soils have thin strata of ashy loamy texture in the particle-size control section and are influenced by diatom grains."
