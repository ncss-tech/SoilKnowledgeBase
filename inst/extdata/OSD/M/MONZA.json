Caralampi and Nolam soils formed in thick alluvium.  Coxwell soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of alluvium over weathered bedrock.  Other associated soils are unnamed soils that also formed in monzonite, but in which depth to an R horizon ranges from 20 to more than 40 inches.  Monza soils are also associated with occasional areas of rock outcrop."

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data for a similar pedon nearby (S70 NMex-70-1 are on pp. 948-951 in Gile, L.H. and R.B.
