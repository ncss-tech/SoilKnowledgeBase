  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Depth to rock ranges from 40 to 80 inches. Coarse fragments, mostly channers of sandstone, siltstone or shale, range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and from 0 to 60 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam. AB or AE horizons with colors and textures similar to the A horizon are common in forested areas, but are not required.\nThe E or BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Lithochromic mottles in shades of brown or red are common, mostly in the lower part. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe C horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Lithochromic mottles in shades red, brown or gray are common or the horizon is variegated in shades red, brown, yellow or gray.\nThe Cr horizon is soft shale or siltstone, often interbedded with thin layers of sandstone.\nThe R horizon is hard black shale."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Boden, Braddock, Buckhall, Buffstat, Casville (T) Christian, Clifton, Clover, Danripple, Flagspring, Goresville, Groseclose, Howell, Mount Rush (T), Quantico, Rapidan, Sequoia, Spears Mountain (T), Totier, Trappist, Unison, Warminster (I) and Yellowbottom (T) series in the same family. Boden soils weathered from sandstone and shale in the Ozarks and have less than 20 percent silt in the Bt horizons. Braddock soils weathered from crystalline rocks and have more sand in the argillic horizon. Buckhall and Buffstat soils formed in residuum weathered from gneiss or schist. Casville and Clifton soils formed in residuum weathered from felsic or intermediate igneous or metamorphic rocks. Christian and Groseclose soils formed in materials weathered from interbedded limestone, sandstone, shale, and siltstone and they allow redder colors in the argillic horizon. Clover, Totier and Warminster soils formed in residuum weathered from Triassic aged materials. Danripple soils formed in alluvium. Flagspring soils formed in colluvium weathered from cherty limestone over residuum also weathered from limestone. Goresville soils formed in old alluvium overlying residuum weathered from red siltstone, shale or sandstone. Howell soils formed in unconsolidated sediments that contain detectable amounts of diatomaceous earth or glauconite. Mount Rush soils formed in clayey residuum weathered from mixed felsic or mafic metamorphic and igneous rocks (commonly hornblende gneiss and schist). Quantico soils formed in stratified marine and fluvial sediments of the northern coastal plain. Rapidan soils formed in residuum on ridges in the Culpepper Jurassic-Triassic basin. Sequoia soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded siltstone and shale and they are moderately deep to paralithic contact. Spears Mountain soils formed in residuum weathered from schist, phyllite or other fine grained rock. Trappist soils are moderately deep. Unison soils formed in colluvium and alluvium 3 to 6 feet thick derived from a mixture of basic rocks and basic and acidic crystalline rocks. Yellowbottom soils formed in residuum weathered from sericite schist, phylonite and metamonzagranite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Muse soils are on side slopes, foot slopes, and benches on uplands. Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent. These soils formed in residuum or colluvium weathered from acid shale and siltstone. Near the type location annual temperature ranges from 53 to 56 degrees F with a mean of 56 degrees. Annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 52 inches with a mean of 47 inches."
