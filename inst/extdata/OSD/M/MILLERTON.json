  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum ranges in thickness from about 6 to 23 inches, but is usually thicker than 10 inches and thinner than 20 inches.  The irregular subsurface relief of the underlying parent rockforms pickets of somewhat deeper soils in places.  The soils have ochric epipedons (chromas of 4 or more moist), argillic horizons and lithic contact.  The soils are dry for more than 60 days in all parts between 10 inches and the lithic contact.\nThe dry color of the A horizon is brown (7.5YR 5/4) but may be brown (10YR 5/3) or reddish brown (5YR 4/4) in places.  The moist color is dark brown (7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 10YR 3/3), but may range to reddish brown or dark reddish brown (5YR 4/3, 3/3, 3/4).  The surface soils is generally structureless, but where undisturbed by trampling, there is a thin granular surface horizon.  These thin horizons have higher contents of organic matter.  Texture of the A horizon is sandy loam.  Surface soil reactions range mainly from slightly acid to neutral, and may be medium acid in places.\nThe Bt horizon is weakly developed.  Textures range from fine sandy loam to loam.  Dry colors are usually reddish brown (5YR 5/4, 4/4), but may trend toward yellowish red in places.  The subsoil structure ranges from massive to weak subangular or weak angular blocky.  Clay films are thin and few to common on ped faces or pore faces.  Subsoil reaction ranges from neutral to slightly acid.  Occasional detached, angular fragments of parent rock may be found in the solum."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  In the  same subgroup there are the Pardee soils which are skeletal and have argillic horizons; the Millsap soils which have clay argillic horizons; and the Stonyford soils which have soil temperatures of less than 59 degrees F.  Similar soils in different orders are the Auburn which lack argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Millerton soils occur on smooth rolling to very steep hills and ridges underlain by metamorphic basic igneous rock.  They occur at elevations of 400 to 1,800 feet in a dry subhumid, mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 14 to 18 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees to 62 degrees F., average January temperature about 46 degrees F., and average July temperature about 79 degrees F."

The Blasingame and Tivy soils are moderately deep to deep and lack the lithic contact.  Fallbrook and Vista soils are developed on granite.  Friant soils are developed on mica schist."
