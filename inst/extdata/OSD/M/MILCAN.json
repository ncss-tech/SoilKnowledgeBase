  "OVERVIEW": "The Milcan series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. Milcan soils are on lava plains. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
