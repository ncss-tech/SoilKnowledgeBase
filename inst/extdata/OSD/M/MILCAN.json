    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Milcan soils are on lava plains. These soils formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks. The volcanic ash deposits are from ancestral Mt. Mazama (Crater Lake) and Newberry Crater. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,525 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm. The mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
