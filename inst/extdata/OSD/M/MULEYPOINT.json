  "OVERVIEW": "The Muleypoint series consists of shallow to carbonate cemented hardpan, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. These soils are on foothills and highly dissected fan terraces and have slopes of 15 to 40 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",
