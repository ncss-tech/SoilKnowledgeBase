  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived dominantly from basic and intermediate igneous rocks.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees. Average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches. The freeze-free period is 90 to 110 days."

Birdow and Monroe soils are greater than 60 inches deep and do not have argillic horizons and occur in broad drainageways. Manderfield soils are greater than 60 inches deep and have an abrupt textural change to sandy or sandy-skeletal. They occur on gently sloping fan terraces downslope from the Muleypoint soils. Ocambee and Robroy soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to igneous bedrock and have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle size control section. They occur on steeply sloping mountainsides."
