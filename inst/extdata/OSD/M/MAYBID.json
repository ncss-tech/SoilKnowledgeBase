  "OVERVIEW": "The Maybid series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in lacustrine or marine sediments.  They are nearly level or level soils on lowlands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the surface layer and very low to moderately high in the subsoil and substratum.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

The soil ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid in the A horizon and from strongly acid to neutral in the B and C horizons.  At least one horizon within 40 inches is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is nonsticky or slightly sticky.\nThe upper part of the Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 5Y, 5G, 5GY or 5BG, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Some redoximorphic features are present in some pedons. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  It has weak platy, weak to moderate subangular blocky or blocky, or moderate fine granular structure, or the horizon is massive.  It is friable or firm and slightly sticky or sticky.\nThe lower part of the Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 5Y or 5GY, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It has distinct to prominent high chroma iron accumulations that comprise less than 40 percent of the matrix.  The Bg horizon is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay.  It has weak to moderate prismatic or blocky structure, or the horizon is massive.\nThe Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 5Y, 5GY, 5G, or 5BG, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay."

Alden, Birdsall, Canadaigua, and Tughill soils have less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Biddeford soils have histic epipedons.  Madalin soils have an argillic horizon.  Clatsop soils have acid reaction.  Defiance, Dunning, and Papakating soils have irregular decrease in organic matter with depth.  In addition, the Papakating soils have less than 35 percent clay.  Fonda, Livingston, and Toledo soils have ochric epipedons; the Livingston soils, in addition, have more than 60 percent clay."

The moderately well and somewhat poorly drained Boxford soils, the poorly drained Scitico soils, and well drained Suffield soils are members of a drainage sequence in the same landscape.  Elmwood, Swanton, and Whately soils have coarse-loamy over clayey particle-size control sections."

Mineralogy and cation exchange activity class are changed in this revision from illitic to mixed based upon a review of similar soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Umbric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 10 inches, when mixed (A and part of the Bg1 horizon).\n2.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 7 inches to a depth of 19 inches (Bg horizon).\n3.  Particle size class - the zone from 10 to 40 inches averages about 55 percent clay (fine)."
