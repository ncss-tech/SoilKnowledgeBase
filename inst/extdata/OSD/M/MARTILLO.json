Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent, but range up to 3 percent.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium predominantly from tuffaceous materials.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 260 days, and elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet."
