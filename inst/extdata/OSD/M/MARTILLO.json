    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Martillo soils are on broad alluvial flats and fan skirts in a mountain and bolson landscape.  Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent, but range up to 3 percent.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium predominantly from tuffaceous materials.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period ranges from 210 to 260 days, and elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet."

Kinco soils have less than 18 percent clay in the control section and are on gently sloping upland plains.  Potrillo soils have less than 20 percent clay in the control section and are on undulating ridges and fans.  Stovall soils have between 18 and 35 percent clay in the control section and are on nearly level to gently sloping upland plains, valleys and alluvial fans."

Overland flow may occur once in 7 to 20 years for a duration of less than 2 days.  When overland flow occurs it is usually in the months of July through September."
