  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 24 inches thick and extends into the Bk horizon of some pedons.  The soil typically is calcareous throughout, but some pedons lack carbonates to a depth of 6 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control sections averages 18 to 30 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent fine sand or coarser.  Calcium carbonate equivalent of the calcic horizon is from 15 to 30 percent.  Saline phases are recognized where the electrical conductivity is up to 16 mmhos/cm.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It typically is loam, but in some pedons is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry; and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is loam, clay loam, or silt loam but strata of silty clay loam or sandy loam are in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with color and textures of the Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It typically is stratified loam, and sandy loam, but is stratified silt loam, loamy sand, clay loam, or silty clay loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have gravelly material below a depth of 40 inches.\nSome pedons do not have 2Ab or 2C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moritz soils are on nearly level flood plains.  Surfaces are plane or slightly convex.  Slopes are commonly less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 2 percent.  Most areas have shallow meandering drainageways running through them.  These drainageways carry only small amounts of sediments.  They formed in alluvium.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 48 degrees and mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 24 inches.  Growing season ranges from 125 to 135 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 15 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 2800."

Divide soils have sand and gravel within depths of 20 to 40 inches and are on similar landscapes. Lamoure soils do not have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches and are fine silty.  They are on similar landscapes.  The moderately well drained La Prairie soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick and are nearer the stream channel."
