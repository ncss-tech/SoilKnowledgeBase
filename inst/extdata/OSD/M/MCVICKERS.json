  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The McVickers soils are on gently sloping to strongly sloping terrain. Slope gradients seldom exceed 15 percent; dominant slopes are about 2 to 5 percent. The soils are located on the Coconino plateau above the Mogollon Rim and formed in residuum from sandstone. Elevations range from 6800 to 7500 feet. Average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 25 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 55 degrees F."
