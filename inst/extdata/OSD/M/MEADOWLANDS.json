  "OVERVIEW": "The Meadowlands series consists of poorly drained soils that formed in loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on flats on glacial lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters.",
