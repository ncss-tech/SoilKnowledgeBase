    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maltese soils are on flats and swales on terraces and uplands.  Slope gradients are usually less than 6 percent, but range to 25 percent.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium or residuum from shale, siltstone or sandstone.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation from 13 to 16 inches.  Most of the precipitation falls in the spring and summer."

In addition, Rhame soils have soft bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Ethridge soils are on fans and uplands.  Kremlin soils are on fans.  Rhame soils are on side slopes.  Gerda soils have a combined A and E horizon thickness of 5 inches or less and have visible salts within 16 inches.  They are in complex with the Maltese series."
