    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A and E horizons and from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the Bt horizons.  Plinthite, where present, is less than 5 percent and is below depths of 60 inches. Depth to redoximorphic features indicative of wetness is more than 40 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value 3 through 5, and chroma 1 through 3.  Texture is very fine sand or fine sand.\nThe upper part of the E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7, and chroma 2 to 8.  Fine to medium pockets of uncoated sand grains with hue of 10YR, value 7 or 8, and chroma 1 or 2 range from none to many. Texture is very fine sand or fine sand.\nThe lower part of the E horizon has hue of hue 10YR, value 6 to 8, and chroma 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations in shades of yellow, red, or brown range from none to common. Texture is very fine sand or fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue 10YR, value 5 through 7, value 3 through 8; or there is no dominant color and it is multicolored in shades of red, yellow, brown, and gray.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, yellow, or red range from none to many.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value 5 through 7, chroma 1 or 2. Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, yellow, or red range from few to many.  Texture is very fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Apopka series in the same family.  Series in closely related families include the Arredondo, Blanton, Bonifay, Sparr, and Troup series.  The well drained Apopka soils are on similar positions and have redder Bt horizons.  The well drained Arredondo soils are on similar positions and have more than 5 percent silt plus clay between 10 to 40 inches. Blanton, Bonifay, and Troup soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 72 degrees F.  In addition, Bonifay soils have more than 5 percent plinthite within depths of 60 inches.  The somewhat poorly drained Sparr soils are on lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick."

The climate is humid semitropical.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 50 to 60 inches and average annual temperature ranges from 72 to 75 degrees F."
