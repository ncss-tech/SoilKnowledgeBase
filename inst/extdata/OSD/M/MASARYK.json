  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Masaryk series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderate or moderately slowly permeable soils on upland ridges in the Coastal Plain of peninsular Florida.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine or eolian deposits.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

The well drained Apopka soils are on similar positions and have redder Bt horizons.  The well drained Arredondo soils are on similar positions and have more than 5 percent silt plus clay between 10 to 40 inches. Blanton, Bonifay, and Troup soils have mean annual soil temperature less than 72 degrees F.  In addition, Bonifay soils have more than 5 percent plinthite within depths of 60 inches.  The somewhat poorly drained Sparr soils are on lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches thick."
