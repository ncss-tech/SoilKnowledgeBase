  "OVERVIEW": "The Minniece series consists of deep and very deep, poorly and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium from basic igneous rocks. These soils are in long, narrow drainageways and basins in mountains. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 75 inches; and the mean annual temperature is 49 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soil has an aquic moisture regime and is saturated most of the time from October to June.  It is partially dry during the summer.  Redox concentrations as masses or pore linings are absent to distinct in the A horizon.  Redox iron and clay depletions and redox concentrations as masses occur in the B and C horizons.  The solum is 24 to more than 60 inches thick.  Rock fragments are commonly absent in the solum but some pedons have up to 10 percent gravel and cobbles.  The soil is moderately acid or slightly acid.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe 2Btg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay. This horizon has moderate or strong primary structure and weak or moderate secondary structure.\nThe 2Cg horizon, when present, has color similar to that of the 2Btg horizon.  It is silty clay, clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam with 35 to 55 percent clay."

Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and alluvium weathered from basic igneous rocks.  The climate is humid temperate with a mean annual precipitation of 50 to 90 inches.  A small amount of precipitation occurs as snow which melts within a few days. The mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 62 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 145 to 190 days."
