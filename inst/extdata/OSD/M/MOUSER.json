  "OVERVIEW": "The Mouser series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from sandstone, mudstone and greenstone. The Mouser soils are on summits and side slopes of mountains and hills. Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",
