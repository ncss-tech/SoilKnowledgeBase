    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is 20 to 40 inches but ranges from 20 to 60 inches.  The soil typically lacks free carbonates throughout, but some pedons have free carbonates below depths of 40 inches.  Rock fragments ranging in size from coarse fragments up to boulders.  Some boulders on the surface are up to 12 feet in diameter.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent by volume in the solum and 40 to 75 percent in the C horizon.  Some pedons have an 0 horizon, 1 to 2 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The A horizon typically is extremely stony or very stony fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam but some pedons are extremely or very stony sandy loam or loam.  It contains 35 to 50 percent by volume of stones, boulders, and coarse fragments of rock.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam, but, is sandy loam or loam in some pedons.  It contains 35 to 65 percent by volume of stones, boulders, and coarse fragments of rock. It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.   It typically is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam but some are sandy clay loam or loam and typically averages 10 to 20 percent clay but ranges from 10 to 30 percent clay. It contains 40 to 65 percent by volume of stones, boulders, and fragments of rock.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It typically is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam but some pedons are sandy clay, clay loam, or loam.  It contains 40 to 65 percent by volume of stones, boulders, and coarse fragments.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It typically is fine sandy loam or loam, but some pedons are sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  It contains 40 to 75 percent by volume of stones, boulders, and coarse fragments of rock.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Sandstone, shale or limestone is below depths of 40 inches in some pedons."
