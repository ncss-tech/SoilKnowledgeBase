  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 38 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 6 feet.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume throughout.  Fragments larger than 3 inches range from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Unless limed, the soil ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid in the surface layer and from very strongly acid to strongly acid in the subsoil and substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It has weak fine or medium granular structure and friable or very friable consistence.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  The B horizon has distinct or prominent redoximorphic concentrations and depletions in the lower part.  The B horizon texture ranges from sandy loam to silt loam above the discontinuity and from sandy clay loam, clay loam or silty clay loam in the 2B horizons.  It has weak or moderate fine to coarse subangular or angular blocky structure in the 2Bw horizon and weak or moderately fine or medium granular structure in the Bw1 horizon.  Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe 2C horizon hue is 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 6 with redoximorphic features.  The 2C horizon texture ranges from sandy clay loam to silty clay.  The horizon is massive or has subangular blocky or angular blocky structure."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Schuyler and Towerville series in the same family and Belgrade, Boxford, Chilmark, Elmridge, Matawan and Scio in related families. Schuyler soils formed in channery glacial till and has more than 10 to 20 percent fragments of thin angular sandstone and shale in the lower solum and C horizon.  Towerville soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Belgrade and Scio are coarse-silty soils and Belgrade is also less acid.  Boxford soils are in a fine family and are also less acid.  Chilmark soils are well drained.  Elmridge soils are coarse-loamy over clayey.  Matawan soils are siliceous and have an argillic horizon."

The soils formed in loamy glacial till. Mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 37 to 49 inches, and the growing season is 120 to 160 days."
