Doten soils have redoximorphic features within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Gerlach soils have thick mollic epipedons and are not effervescent within 100 cm of the soil surface.  Getrail soils are not effervescent and have paralithic materials of marine shale within the series control section.  Horsecamp soils are deep to lithic contacts and have secondary carbonates at depths of 50 to 90 cm.  Moroni soils are higher in calcium carbonate equivalent and do not have cambic horizons.  Waspo soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts."
