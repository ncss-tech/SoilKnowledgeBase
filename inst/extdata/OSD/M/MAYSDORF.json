  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to secondary calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from 12 to 40 inches but is greater than 40 inches in some pedons.  The moisture control section is dry for 60 consecutive days and 90 cumulative days between July 15 and October 25 in most years.  Gravel content is typically less than 5 percent but ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. Textures are sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Textures are sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR which is stratified with subhorizons with hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  Both strata have value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Textures are typically sandy clay loam but some transitional horizons may be sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Textures are sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalence ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  In some pedons this horizon is below 40 inches.  Some pedons have a C horizon with characteristics similar to the Bk except for the lack of secondary calcium carbonate."

Barx, Clovis, Solirex and Wineg soils have calcic horizons with more than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Millett soils have solums less than 20 inches thick and skeletal material below the argillic horizon.  Progresso and Threetop soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Selpats soils have skeletal material within a depth of 40 inches.  Solirex soils have Bk horizons more than 40 inches thick.  Tuweep soils have pyroclastic material and have skeletal material in the lower part."
