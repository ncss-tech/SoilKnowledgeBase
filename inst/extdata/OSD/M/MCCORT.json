  "OVERVIEW": "The McCort series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gravelly slope alluvium derived from quartzitic conglomerate.  McCort soils are on alluvial fans and mountain side.  Slopes range from 2 to 55 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees.",

(Bw horizon)\nThese soils were formerly classified as Chernozems.  A paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August 2000.  The classification was changed from Typic Cryoborolls to Ustic Haplocryolls.  Format and horizonation designations were updated.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition of Soil Taxonomy 1999."
