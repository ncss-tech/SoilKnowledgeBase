    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (A2 through C2 horizons)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 12 inches.  (A1 and A2 horizons)\nCambic horizon:  The zone from 12 to 21 inches.  (Bw horizon)\nThese soils were formerly classified as Chernozems.  A paper revision and update of the series was made by MO6 August 2000.  The classification was changed from Typic Cryoborolls to Ustic Haplocryolls.  Format and horizonation designations were updated.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Second Edition of Soil Taxonomy 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
