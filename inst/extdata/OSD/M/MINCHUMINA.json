  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  Permafrost occurs within the loess mantle and is encountered within 2 to 20 inches below the surface of the mineral soil 2 months after the summer solstice.  The mat of organic material consists of fibrous moss and roots over partially decomposed organic material from 8 to 16 inches thick.  Texture throughout the loess mantle is silt or silt loam with less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sands or coarser.  Coarse fragment content in the loess mantle is less than 10 percent.  The depth to the underlying glacial till is highly variable.  Reaction throughout the profile ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value moist from 2 to 5; and chroma moist of 2 or 3.\nThe Cf horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value moist from 3 to 5; and chroma moist from 2 to 6. COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Durelle(T) and McKinley(T) series in the same subgroup.  Durelle and McKinley soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  Durelle soils are also calcareous."
