  "OVERVIEW": "The Manary series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified silty and clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
