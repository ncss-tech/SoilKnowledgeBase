Sandstone fragments less than 3 inches in diameter range from 0 to 35 percent by volume in the A horizon; 0 to 35 percent by volume in the E horizon, where present; 0 to 35 percent by volume in the Bt horizons and 0 to 60 percent in the BC horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, gravelly fine sandy loam, or gravelly loam.\nThe BE, where present, has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 5 and a chroma\nof 4 or 6.

Texture is loam, clay loam or sandy clay loam or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt2 horizon has hues of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 6 or 8. Some pedons contain redoximorphic features below a depth of 30 inches from the soil surface. Texture is clay loam, loam or sandy clay loam or their gravelly analogs.\nThe lower Bt horizons, where present, have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR,value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Some pedons lack a dominant matrix color and are variegated in shades of yellow, red, brown and gray.
