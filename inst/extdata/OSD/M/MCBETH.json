    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is more than 47 degrees F. They are affected by a water table at depths of 12 to 24 inches, unless drained.\nThe mollic epipedon is less than 24 inches thick. Organic matter decreases irregularly as depth increases and is more than 0.5 percent in all horizons above a depth of 50 inches.\nThe 10 to 40 inch control section is characterized by strata with textures ranging from silty clay loam to fine sand. Clay content averages less than 18 percent and there is less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand. Texture below depth of 40 inches ranges from silty clay loam to sandy loam. These soils are strongly calcareous but lack a calcic horizon. The soils are moderately or strongly alkaline. Salinity ranges from none to strong.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 0.5 to 1 if without mottles, 1 or 2 if mottled.\nThe Bg and Cg horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 1.5 or less if not mottled, 2 or less if mottled."

These soils formed in stratified alluvium derived from limestone sandstone and quartzite. The climate is semiarid or dry subhumid, having a mean annual temperature of 46 to 51 degrees F., a mean summer temperature of 66 to 70 degrees F., and an average annual precipitation of 12 to 16 inches.  The frost-free period is 120 to 170 days."
