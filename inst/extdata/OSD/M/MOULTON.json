Slopes are dominantly less than 1 percent and range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in recent alluvium dominantly from granitic material and a small amount from basalt.  The average annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees.  The frost-free period ranges from 140 to 160 days, and the average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 12 inches, including 1.5 to 3 feet of snow."
