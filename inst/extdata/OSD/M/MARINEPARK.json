  "OVERVIEW": "The Marinepark series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils formed in a thin loamy mantle of human transported material over dredged materials or sandy sediments. They occur on anthropogenic landscapes in and near major urbanized areas of the Northeast. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the loamy mantle and high or very high in the sandy substratum. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1196 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 25 to 69 cm. Total fragments (combined natural and artifacts), mainly gravel-sized, range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and from 0 to 30 percent in substratum. Artifact fragments range from 0 to 10 percent in the loamy solum. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the loamy mantle, and from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the sandy substratum. Some pedons have sea shell fragments in the lower part of the soil.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. It has granular or subangular blocky structure, and the consistence is commonly friable or very friable, but the range includes platy structure and/or firm consistence in compacted areas.\nThe ^Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Redoximorphic features can be found in the lower part of the horizon in some pedons. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the upper part and sandy loam or loamy sand in the lower part. Sandy loam textures do not extend below a depth of 69 centimeters. Structure is commonly subangular blocky and consistence is friable or very friable. Some pedons have an ^AB or ^BA horizon above the ^Bw horizon.\nThe 2^C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to sand in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons are stratified. This horizon is typically structureless, with very friable or loose consistence.  Pockets of loamy fill material similar in properties to the ^Bw horizons can be found in the upper portion of the substratum in some pedons."

Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1021 to 1325 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series is named for Marine Park in Brooklyn, New York.\nMarinepark soils are mapped in the soil survey areas of the Gateway National Recreation Area and the initial survey areas of Kings and Queens Counties, NY. The soils are of minimal extent (less than 1,000 acres), however they are of unique importance to users of the soil surveys.\nMarinepark soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition; excluding them from the concept of Fluvaquentic Eutrudepts. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy in ICOMANTH Circular Letter 7 developed for anthropogenic soils will help to clarify this difference.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognize in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 cm (^Au horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 49 cm (^Bwu1 and ^Bwu2 horizons).\n3. Aquic Dystric Eutrudepts - base saturation (by NH4OAc) of 60 percent or more in one or more horizons at a depth between 25 and 75 cm from the mineral soil surface; does not have free carbonates within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface; redox depletions with chroma 2 or less within 60 cm and aquic conditions for some time in normal years."
