  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 25 to 69 cm. Total fragments (combined natural and artifacts), mainly gravel-sized, range from 0 to 35 percent in the solum and from 0 to 30 percent in substratum. Artifact fragments range from 0 to 10 percent in the loamy solum. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the loamy mantle, and from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the sandy substratum. Some pedons have sea shell fragments in the lower part of the soil.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam. It has granular or subangular blocky structure, and the consistence is commonly friable or very friable, but the range includes platy structure and/or firm consistence in compacted areas.\nThe ^Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Redoximorphic features can be found in the lower part of the horizon in some pedons. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the upper part and sandy loam or loamy sand in the lower part. Sandy loam textures do not extend below a depth of 69 centimeters. Structure is commonly subangular blocky and consistence is friable or very friable. Some pedons have an ^AB or ^BA horizon above the ^Bw horizon.\nThe 2^C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to sand in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons are stratified. This horizon is typically structureless, with very friable or loose consistence.  Pockets of loamy fill material similar in properties to the ^Bw horizons can be found in the upper portion of the substratum in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Marinepark soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping modified landforms. These soils formed in a loamy fill mantle over sandy deposits on outwash plains, barrier beaches and islands, or dredged deposits. The loamy material is relatively clean with less than 10 percent of human artifacts and less than 35 percent gravel. Sea shell fragments may be present in the lower sandy part. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1021 to 1325 mm. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees C."

Flatbush soils are well drained and have a coarse-loamy particle size class. Fortress soils do not have a cambic horizon and formed only in dredge sands.  Greenbelt soils are well drained and have more than 100 cm of loamy fill. Riverhead and Windsor soils formed naturally have less than 10 inches of human transported material at the surface."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series is named for Marine Park in Brooklyn, New York.\nMarinepark soils are mapped in the soil survey areas of the Gateway National Recreation Area and the initial survey areas of Kings and Queens Counties, NY. The soils are of minimal extent (less than 1,000 acres), however they are of unique importance to users of the soil surveys.\nMarinepark soils often exhibit an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth however this is a result of anthropogenic filling (deposition) not alluvial deposition; excluding them from the concept of Fluvaquentic Eutrudepts. Proposed revisions to soil taxonomy in ICOMANTH Circular Letter 7 developed for anthropogenic soils will help to clarify this difference.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognize in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 cm (^Au horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 49 cm (^Bwu1 and ^Bwu2 horizons).\n3. Aquic Dystric Eutrudepts - base saturation (by NH4OAc) of 60 percent or more in one or more horizons at a depth between 25 and 75 cm from the mineral soil surface; does not have free carbonates within 100 cm of the mineral soil surface; redox depletions with chroma 2 or less within 60 cm and aquic conditions for some time in normal years.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
