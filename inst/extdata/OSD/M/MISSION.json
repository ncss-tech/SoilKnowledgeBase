  "OVERVIEW": "The Mission series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils that are shallow to a fragipan. They formed in glaciolacustrine sediments with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. These soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments. Permeability is very slow in the fragipan. Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
