Arrowpeak, Clamp, Dalys, Dollarhide, Eyre, Irigul, Irson, Jonlake, Labshaft, Milling, Poin, Rogert, Schwacheim, Topeki and Udel soils are noncalcareous.  Cheadle soils have an ustic moisture regime bordering on udic.  Chokecherry soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.   Starley soils have soil moisture control sections affected by peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer."

(Bk horizon)\nLithic contact:  The contact with limestone bedrock at 41 cm.  (R horizon)\nThe Bk horizon does not qualify as a calcic horizon either due to insufficient thickness and/or carbonate equivalent.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Classified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2011.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
