  "OVERVIEW": "The Moberg series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in a thin silty or loamy mantle and in the underlying very gravelly or extremely gravelly residuum (grus) weathered from granite.  These soils have moderately rapid permeability in the silty or loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the residuum.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 32 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

This series is inextensive.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota\nSERIES ESTABLISHED:  Marathon County, Wisconsin, 1986.\nREMARKS: These soils appear to straddle the loamy-skeletal and sandy-skeletal particle-size classes, but more pedons can be placed in the sandy-skeletal and this will be the concept.\nThe highly weathered granite (grus) has undergone extensive chemical and mechanical weathering and the granite pebble size and cobble size fragments crush to sand and silt size fragments.  The pebble size fragments, in place, behave as gravel in-so-far as the bulk density, permeability, and available water are concerned.  As a construction material, the pebble size fragments crush to sand and silt size material.  The logical UNIFIED classification is SM or SP.  The pebble size fragments are not suitable for aggregate so it is not a probable source of sand or gravel.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 4 inches (A horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 20 inches (Bw, 2BC horizons); do not have carbonates in the cambic horizon or in the C horizon within the soil; do not have mottles that have chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the soil surface; do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 20 inches."
