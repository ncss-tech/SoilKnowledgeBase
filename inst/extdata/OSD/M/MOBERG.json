The particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 55 percent coarse fragments by volume and the texture of the fine earth is sand or loamy sand.\nThe A or Ap horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is silt loam, loam, or the gravelly analogues.  Some pedons have an E horizon with 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has textures similar to the A or Ap horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value and chroma is 4 or 5.  It is silt loam, loam, or the gravelly analogues.\nThe 2BC horizon has 7.5YR or 5YR hue, value and chroma is 4 through 6.  It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has 7.5YR or 5YR hue, value and chroma is 4 through 6.  It consists of an accumulation of waste consisting of angular, coarse-grained fragments resulting from the granular disintegration of crystalline rocks (esp. granite).  The pebble and cobble size fragments crush to sand size material without much difficulty."

This series is inextensive.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: St. Paul, Minnesota\nSERIES ESTABLISHED:  Marathon County, Wisconsin, 1986.\nREMARKS: These soils appear to straddle the loamy-skeletal and sandy-skeletal particle-size classes, but more pedons can be placed in the sandy-skeletal and this will be the concept.\nThe highly weathered granite (grus) has undergone extensive chemical and mechanical weathering and the granite pebble size and cobble size fragments crush to sand and silt size fragments.  The pebble size fragments, in place, behave as gravel in-so-far as the bulk density, permeability, and available water are concerned.  As a construction material, the pebble size fragments crush to sand and silt size material.  The logical UNIFIED classification is SM or SP.  The pebble size fragments are not suitable for aggregate so it is not a probable source of sand or gravel.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 4 inches (A horizon); cambic horizon - the zone from 4 to 20 inches (Bw, 2BC horizons); do not have carbonates in the cambic horizon or in the C horizon within the soil; do not have mottles that have chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the soil surface; do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 20 inches.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
