  "OVERVIEW": "The Mountmed series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Mountmed soils are on fans and floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
