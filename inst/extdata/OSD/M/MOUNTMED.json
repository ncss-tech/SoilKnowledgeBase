The soil is saturated between the depths of 0 and 18 inches from November thru June and below 18 inches from July thru October unless drained.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from June 1 to December 15, and exceeds 47 degrees F from July 1 to December 1.  Depth to the 2C horizon varies from 40 to more than 60 inches from the surface of the mineral soil.  Depth to mottles is from the base of the mollic epipedon to a depth of 40 inches.  Some pedons lack an O horizon.  Some pedons lack secondary lime.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/1; 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 5/1 or N 4/0.  Moist color is 10YR 3/1, 2.5Y 3/2, 5Y 3/1 or N 2/0.  It is loam, clay loam or clay.\nThe Cg horizon is 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 7/4; 5Y 5/1, 6/1, 6/2, 7/1; 5GY 7/1 or 6/1.  Moist color is 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4; 5Y 3/1, 4/2, 5/1; 5GY 5/1 or 4/1.\nThe 2C horizon is 2.5Y 7/4 or 5G 7/1.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/4 or 5G 5/1.  It is clay or coarse sandy loam modified by 15 to 20 percent 2 to 5 mm gravel and 10 to 50 percent 5 to 75 mm gravel.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevation is 5,040 to 5,300 feet.  The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches with 60 to 100 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F., mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F. and mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 80 days."
