  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 to 62 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 6 and 18 inches is usually moist in some part from November sometime in May and is dry all the rest of the year.  The soil is medium or slightly acid in the A horizon and slightly acid to mildly alkaline in the B2t horizon, and no free lime is present.  The solum is about 40 to 70 inches thick.\nThe A horizon is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loam and is brown or grayish brown in 10YR hue.  Moist colors in the upper 4 to 6 inches are dark brown to very dark grayish brown in 10YR or 7.5YR hue and the organic matter is 1.3 to 2.0 percent.  The A1 horizon becomes massive and hard within 10 inches or less of the surface.  The A2 horizon is 1 to 2 units higher in value than the A1 horizon.\nThe B2t horizon is yellowish brown or dark yellowish brown clay or sandy clay in 10YR hue or brown or dark brown in 7.5YR hue.  The interior of some peds has blotches with 5YR hue.  The upper boundary of the B2t horizon is abrupt with 20 to 35 percent more total clay in the upper part of the B2t horizon than the overlying A horizon.  The upper part of the B2t horizon has moderate to strong prismatic structure and the lower part has moderate to strong angular blocky structure.  The C horizon is loam or sandy loam and is gravelly or cobbly in some pedons."

Positas soils have hue of 5YR in the upper part of the B2t horizon.  San Ysidro soils have A1 horizons with dry value of 6 and moist value of 3.5 or higher.  Tierra soils have chroma of 3 or less in the upper part of the B2t horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Milpitas soils are nearly level to steep on old terraces at elevations of 30 to 500 feet.  They formed in alluvium derived largely from sandstone.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 13 to 19 inches.  The average January temperature is about 52 degrees F., average July temperature about 67 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.  The average freeze-free season is about 330 days."
