Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent.  Manawa soils formed in clayey till, typically with a thin mantle of loess or other silty deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 890 mm (26 to 35 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 11.7 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F)."

The moderately well drained and well drained Kewaunee and poorly drained Poygan form a drainage sequence with the somewhat poorly drained Manawa soils.  Oshkosh soils are better drained and are on slightly higher rises.  Peebles soils have a mollic epipedon and better natural drainage.  Winneconne soils are nearby on better drained landscape positions.  Zittau soils are on outwash plains and stream benches."

    "content": "REMARKS:  12/04  5700 acres of Manawa were correlated in Door County as a temperature taxadjunct because they are in the frigid temperature zone. A new series is needed for these acres.\n12/04  This series previously included 2 different parent materials (clayey till and clayey lacustrine deposits). This revision redefines this series as being formed in clayey till only. A new series is needed for 3750 acres correlated in\nJuneau County as being formed in clayey lacustrine deposits. In addition, a portion of the acreage correlated in surveys in Brown, Calumet-Manitowoc, Fond du Lac, Green Lake, Outagamie, and Waushara Counties may be formed in clayey lacustrine deposits. A new series will be needed for these acres when these\nsurveys are updated.\n12/04  Lab data for 1 pedon from Calumet County and 1 pedon from Fond du Lac County shows high bulk density (1.84  2.0) in the till. Further study is needed to determine if the series concept should be changed to dense till.\nDiagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 31 cm (0 to 12 inches) (Ap, E); argillic horizon - 31 to 76 cm (12 to 30 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3); aquic feature - redox depletions with chroma of 2 and saturation in the upper 25 cm (10 inches) of the argillic horizon; mollic subgroup - Ap horizon with color value and chroma, moist, less than 4 and color value, dry, less than 6.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to soil survey sample numbers 60WI015001 and 59WI039004 for NSSL data on two pedons of Manawa.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
