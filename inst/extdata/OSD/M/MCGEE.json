  "OVERVIEW": "The McGee series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly or moderately well drained soils formed in till and colluvium derived from granitic rocks. McGee soils are on lateral and ground moraines in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1030 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
