They formed in alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff of the Quaternary age Bandelier Tuff formation and dacite of the Tertiary age Tschicoma Formation. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from 6,000 to 6,900 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. The frost-free period is 130 to 150 days."
