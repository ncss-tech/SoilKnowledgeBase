  "OVERVIEW": "The Metate series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from rhyolitic tuff and dacite. Metate soils are on flood plain steps of valley floors.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
