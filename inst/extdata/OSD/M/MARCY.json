    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum ranges from 36 to 50 inches.  Free carbonates are present at depths ranging from the base of the solum to seven feet. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 12 to 18 inches.  In many pedons the zone above the fragipan is nearly free of rock fragments in a deposit of local colluvium; otherwise rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume throughout the soil.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture ranges from loam to silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  They have weak or moderate granular structure, are friable or very friable, and range from strongly acid to neutral in reaction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2, and have common to many mottles of higher chroma. Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It has granular or blocky structure, and friable or firm consistence.  Reaction ranges from strongly  acid to neutral.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2, and has few to common mottles of higher chroma.  Texture is loam or silt loam.  It has moderate to strong very coarse prismatic structure or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is firm or very firm.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.  Clay films are present in pores but not on ped faces and aggregate less than 1 percent of the volume.\nThe C horizon is similar to the Bx horizon in color and texture, but is massive or platy and less brittle.  It is  moderately acid to mildly alkaline in the upper part and typically slightly effervescent within 90 inches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Marcy series is presently the only series in its family.  Similar soils include the Burnham, Cabot, Camroden, Chippewa, Dannemora, Ellery, Monarda, Norwich, and Whitman series. Burnham, Cabot, and Monarda are coarse-loamy and lack a fragipan.  Dannemora soils are coarse-loamy.  Chippewa, Ellery, and Norwich have a mesic temperature regime.  Camroden soils have a layer within 30 inches of the surface that has more than 40 percent with chroma greater than 2.  Whitman soils are coarse-loamy and have a mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Marcy soils occupy nearly level and uniformly gently sloping landscapes of till plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The regolith is firm glacial till derived mainly from shale and siltstone, with or without a thin surficial deposit of colluvial or aeolian origin.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 55 inches; deep snowfall is common.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 42 degrees to 45 degrees F; and the mean frost-free period ranges from 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 800 to 2000 feet above sea level."
