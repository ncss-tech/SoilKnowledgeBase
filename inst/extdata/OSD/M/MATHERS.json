  "OVERVIEW": "The Mathers series consists of well drained,  moderately deep to sand and gravel soils on old terrace levels, glacial outwash plains, and on alluvial fans where the parent sediments are dominated by materials weathered from granite bedrock. Slopes range from 0 to about 15 percent. These soils formed in moderately coarse to moderately fine textured materials weathered from granite. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 20 inches, with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and early summer months. Average annual temperature is 36 degrees F., and average summer temperature is 56 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick, and depth to the contrasting 2C horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Content of organic carbon ranges from 1 to 4 percent in the A horizon but decreases rapidly and uniformly with depth. The soil is 60 to 80 percent base-saturated. These soils have an extremely hard, semi-cemented consistence when air dry in horizons that are low in organic matter and have low volume change on wetting and drying. Content of coarse fragments in the solum ranges from 15 to 35 percent, most of which are fine and very fine angular granite fragments. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 47 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature from 40 degrees to 46 degrees F. with an O horizon at least 4 inches thick and good crown cover.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It usually has platy primary structure but has granular structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft to slightly hard and slightly to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically coarse sandy clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 5 to 30 percent, and sand from 45 to 70 percent with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser, and with a high percentage of medium and coarse angular granite sand. This horizon has oriented clay films in some part. It is slightly acid to neutral."
