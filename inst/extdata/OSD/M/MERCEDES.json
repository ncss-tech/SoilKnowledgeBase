  "OVERVIEW": "The Mercedes series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous clayey alluvium.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands of the South Texas Coastal Plain. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",
