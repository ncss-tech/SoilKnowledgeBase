  "OVERVIEW": "The Minnehaha series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in loamy materials from surface mining. Minnehaha soils are on spoil hills on till plains. Slope ranges from 35 to 75 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.2 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

The spoil consists of shale, soil, till, and minor amounts of sandstone, siltstone and shale rock fragments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 13.3 degrees C (50 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days. Elevation is 104 to 320 meters (340 to 1050 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Ava, Cincinnati, and Shakamak soils are on summits and shoulders. The well drained Hickory soils are on backslopes. The somewhat poorly drained Vigo soils are on summits. The well drained, less permeable Nawakwa and Tapawingo soils and the somewhat poorly drained Hollybrook soils are on summits and shoulders on reconstructed areas from surface mining."
