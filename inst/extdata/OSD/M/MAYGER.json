  "OVERVIEW": "The Mayger series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium wheathered from shale.  Mayger soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Chismore soils have an umbric epipedon.  Cottrell and Suver soils have a xeric moisture regime and have hue redder than 10YR in the argillic horizon.
