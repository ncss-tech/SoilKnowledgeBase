The soil is saturated with water from November through May and is dry for less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the 4-month period following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam and averages 35 to 40 percent clay.  Mottles are dark brown or strong brown.  It is extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 5 or 6 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Mottles are strong brown or brown.  This horizon averages 45 to 70 percent clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chismore, Cottrell and Suver series.  All of these soils lack a discontinuity of a finer textured 2C horizon immediately below the argillic horizon.  Chismore soils have an umbric epipedon.  Cottrell and Suver soils have a xeric moisture regime and have hue redder than 10YR in the argillic horizon.  Also, Suver soils have 55 to 60 percent clay in the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from shale rock.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and warm moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 90 inches.  The mean January temperature is 35 to 37 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 100 to 210 days."

Glohm soils are moderately well drained and 20 to 40 inches deep to a fragipan.  Goble soils are well drained and 20 to 40 inches deep to siltstone or shale.  Kenusky soils are poorly drained and have dominant chroma of 2 or less throughout the profile.  Vernonia soils are well drained and fine-silty."
