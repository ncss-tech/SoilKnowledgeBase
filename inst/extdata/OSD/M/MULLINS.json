  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to acid sandstone, siltstone, or shale bedrock ranges from 4 to more than 20 feet.  Reaction ranges from strongly to extremely acid.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 12 to 28 inches. Coarse fragments range from none to 5 percent in the Ap, Btg, and Btx horizons and from 0 to 35 percent in the Cg.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or less, with redox features in shades of brown. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less, with few to many redox features in shades of yellow, brown, red, olive or gray.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less, with few to many redox features in shades of brown or yellow or has an evenly colored horizon in shades of brown, yellow, and gray. The upper part of the Btx horizon of some pedons has a few thin light gray or white silt coatings on prisms faces or as vertical seams. Texture is dominantly silt loam or silty clay loam; in the lower part of some pedons it is loam or clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, 10YR, or N/0, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less, with redox features in shades of brown or yellow or is evenly colored in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, loam, or clay loam, and is stratified in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mullins soils are on broad nearly level ridge tops and low stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in old alluvium and residuum from acid siltstone, sandstone, and shale.  Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 54.6 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 47.3 inches."

The Atkins and Stendal soils on floodplains lack argillic horizons and fragipans, and the Atkins soils have more than 15 percent sand in the control section.  Latham soils have clayey B horizons and a clay shale Cr at a depth of 20 to 40 inches, and are better drained.  Purdy soils have clayey B horizons and lack fragipans.  Shelocta soils lack fragipans and are well drained."
