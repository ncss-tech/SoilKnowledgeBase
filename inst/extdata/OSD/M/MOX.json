  "OVERVIEW": "The Mox series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying glacial drift and colluvium from glacial drift.  Mox soils are found on slopes of 15 to 60 percent on debris aprons and Pleistocene moraines.  The mean annual precipitation is about 2,280 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
