  "REVDATE": "11/98",
  "STATES": "SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mawer series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium overlying sand and gravel on terraces and fans.  These soils have moderately rapid permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the substratum.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam with a clay content of 12 to 18 percent, but is sandy loam in some pedons.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThin 2Bk, Bk, or BC horizons are in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from loose sand and gravel to gravelly loamy fine sand.  It contains 15 to 45 percent by volume gravel.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
