    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 20 to 40 inches and depth to carbonate ranges from 15 to 25 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam with a clay content of 12 to 18 percent, but is sandy loam in some pedons.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThin 2Bk, Bk, or BC horizons are in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It ranges from loose sand and gravel to gravelly loamy fine sand.  It contains 15 to 45 percent by volume gravel.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Altvan soils have more clay in the argillic horizon.   Dix soils have sand and gravel substrata within depths of 20 inches and are on similar landscapes or on terrace escarpments."
