  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Maloterre series consists of very shallow, somewhat excessively drained, moderately slow permeable soils that formed in residuum weathered from limestone.  These upland soils have slopes ranging from 1 to 20 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 3 to 10 inches.  Total clay content ranges from 30 to 45 percent, with the noncarbonate clay fraction being less than 35 percent.  Fragments, commonly of gravel size, of limestone in the soil range from 5 to 35 percent by volume.  Calcium carbonate in the fraction less than 20 mm ranges from 40 to 80 percent.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2; 2.5Y 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2; 2.5Y 5/2), brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 4/2), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2; 2.5Y 6/2), pale or very pale brown (10YR 6/3, 7/3, 7/4).  A horizons with moist color values and chromas of less than 3.5 are less than 4 inches thick.  The A horizon is gravelly clay loam, gravelly clay, clay loam, or clay.\nThe R layer ranges from indurated white limestone to conglomerate limestone with many imbedded fossil shells."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brackett, Dugout, Ector, Eddy, Latom, Nebgen, Tarrant, and Yates series.  Brackett and Dugout soils are deeper and have cambic horizons.  Ector, Eddy, and Yates soils contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments.  In addition, Ector soils have dark A horizons and Eddy, as well as Brackett soils, lack lithic contacts.  Latom and Nebgen soils contain less than 40 percent calcium carbonate and have a lithic contact with sandstone.  Tarrant soils have mollic epipedons, montmorillonitic mineralogy and contain more than 35 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Maloterre soils occupy gently sloping to moderately steep, smooth to benched uplands with gradients ranging from 1 to 20 percent.  The soil formed in residuum weathered from limestones of Lower Cretaceous Age.  The localities of probable occurrence have mean annual temperatures of 64 degrees to 68 degrees F, range in average annual precipitation of 28 to 35 inches, and Thornthwaite annual P-E indices of 44 to 54."

Bolar, Denton, and Somervell soils have mollic epipedons and sola thicker than 20 inches.  Purves soils have mollic epipedons and montmorillonitic mineralogy."
