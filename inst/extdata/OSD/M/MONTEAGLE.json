Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except the surface layer is less acid where limed.  Fragments of sandstone, 1/2 to 3 inches across, range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and Bt horizons and 0 to 35 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and E horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe BE or Bt1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is dominantly clay loam, but includes silt loam or loam.\nThe remaining Bt horizons have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown yellow and red.  Texture is clay loam, clay, or less commonly sandy clay loam or sandy clay.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the Bt and the C horizon.\nThe Cr horizon is weathered sandstone bedrock."

Canmer soils have redder hues and lower values in the upper part of the Bt horizon.  Doniphan soils have more than 25 percent chert in the upper part of the pedon.  Frederick soil formed in residuum from limestone and have a lower sand content in the Bt horizon.  Macedonia soils have Bt horizons with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR."

Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. The average annual temperature is 56 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is 60 inches near the type location."

Alticrest, Beersheba, Lily, and Ramsey soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  They are normally on more highly dissected topography.  Clarkrange soils are on broader ridgetops and have a fragipan in the subsoil.  Hendon soils are fine-loamy and have a brittle layer in the subsoil.  Lonewood soils are fine-loamy and have bedrock at 40 to 70 inches."
