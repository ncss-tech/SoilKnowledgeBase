  "OVERVIEW": "The May series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy alluvium. These nearly level and gently sloping soils occur along stream terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 18.9 degrees C (66 degrees F).",
