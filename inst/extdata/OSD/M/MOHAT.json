  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mohat series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy alluvium.  These nearly level soils occur on flood plains, mainly along the Colorado and Brazos Rivers.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1194 mm (47 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (70 degrees F).",
