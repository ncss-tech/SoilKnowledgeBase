    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum varies from 35 to 60 inches.  Reaction of the profile ranges from strongly acid to medium acid.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 6 or 8.  Texture is dominantly clay.  The structure of these horizons ranges from weak coarse to fine subangular blocky.  Few subrounded stones, 12 to 24 inches in diameter of more resistant volcanic materials can be found scattered throughout the profiles.\nThe BC horizon has similar colors of the Bt horizon.  Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam.  Amount of saprolite ranges from 25 to 50 percent.\nThe C horizon has variegated colors and consists of saprolite."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Coto, Matanzas, Catalina and Humatas series.  The Coto soils are yellower (hues of 7.5YR), have weaker structure and lack clay films in the B horizon. The Matanzas soils, are darker (lower values) in color, have granular B horizons that lack clay films.  The Catalina soils are more acid, and have lower (less than 50) percent base saturation.  The Humatas soils are more acid, have B horizons with moderate structure and patchy clay films that qualify for argillic and in addition have lower percent base saturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils occur on moderately steep to topography on side slopes of dissected volcanic uplands with slope gradients of 30 to 50 percent.  The regolith consists of very highly weathered residuum of basic volcanic rocks with occasional stones or boulders of less weathered rocks.  The climate is semi-arid tropical with annual precipitation ranging from 40 to 55 inches and mean annual temperature ranging from 78 to 80 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These include the Cramer, Isaac, Victory and Dorothea series.  All these soils occur in similar topographic positions in the steep volcanic uplands.  The Cramer soils are shallow (less than 20 inches) to hard volcanic rocks.  The Isaac soils have dark colored (mollic) surface layers and are moderately deep (20 to 72 inches) to hard volcanic rocks. The Victory soils are yellower (10YR to 7.5YR hues) and have weakly developed (cambic) B horizons. The Dorothea soils are yellower (7.5YR to 10YR hues) and have B horizons with moderate structure and clay films."
