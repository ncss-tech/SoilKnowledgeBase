  "OVERVIEW": "The Mahukona series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic volcanic ash and residuum from basaltic lava.  Mahukona soils are on ash fields and have slopes of 3 to 12 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 635 millimeters (25 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.)",

These soils are on all hillslope positions of gently sloping to strongly sloping ash fields on pahoehoe flows that are 750,000 to 250,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 3 to 12 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over residuum from basaltic lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 760 millimeters (20 to 30 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 2,286 to 2,540 meters (90 to 100 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 21 to 24 degrees C. (70 to 76 degrees F.) average January temperature is 71 degrees F.; average July temperature is 76 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
