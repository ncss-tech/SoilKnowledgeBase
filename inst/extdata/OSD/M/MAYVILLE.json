    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Mayville soils typically are on ground moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in loess and in the underlying till.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 710 to 940 mm (28 to 37 inches).  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 11.1 degrees C (46 to 52 degrees F).  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 180 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dodge, Lamartine, and St. Charles, soils.  The well drained Dodge soils and the somewhat poorly drained Lamartine soils form a drainage sequence with Mayville soils.  St. Charles soils occupy contiguous areas of similar slopes where loess thickens to greater than 102 cm (40 inches)."

The potential for surface runoff is low or medium.  saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometer per second) in the solum  and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometer per second) in the substratum. Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately slow in the substratum.  Mayville soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2.0 to 3.5 feet) for 1 month or more per year, at some time during November to April, in 6 or more out of 10 years."
