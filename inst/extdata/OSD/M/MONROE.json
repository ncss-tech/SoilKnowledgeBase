Blackrock soils average 20 to 35 percent gravel in the particle-size control section and have a xeric moisture regime. Collister, Draper, Eastcan, Goose Creek, Gosinta, Heidtman, Shoepeg, Soquel, and Winn soils have redox concentrations and endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface. Dagor and Goosenawt soils have a xeric moisture regime. Fanu and Willowdale soils have volcanic glass in the particle-size control section and horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates. Lakeview soils have endosaturation within 150 cm of the soil surface. Oxy soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts and have a xeric moisture regime."

Elevations range from 1,520 to 1,980 meters in Utah and 427 to 1,615 meters in Idaho and Oregon. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C. and the mean summer temperature is 19.5 to 20.5 degrees C. The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."
