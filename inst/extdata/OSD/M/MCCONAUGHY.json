  "OVERVIEW": "The McConaughy series consists of deep well drained soils on upland hillslopes.  They formed in calcareous loess.  Slopes range from 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 46 centimeters (18 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.) at the type location.",
