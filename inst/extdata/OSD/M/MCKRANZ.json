  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are typically calcareous throughout, but in some pedons the upper 10 inches is leached. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches. The control section has 24 to 35 percent clay. Concentrations of gypsum crystals are in some pedons, but they are not diagnostic for the series. Typically the upper loess mantle lacks rock fragments and the underlying till has 2 to 8 percent, by volume, rock fragments.  The depth to clay loam glacial till ranges from 20 to 40 inches. A pebble line 1 to 3 inches in thickness is at the glacial till contact in some pedons. Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is silty clay loam but is silt loam in some pedons. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 (5 to 7 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically is silty clay loam but is silt loam in some pedons. It is slightly or moderately alkaline. Calcium carbonate is commonly disseminated throughout the Bk, but in some pedons an accumulations may be visible. It contains 15 to more than 30 percent calcium carbonate equivalent. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a 2Bk horizon with loam or clay loam textures.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 (5 to 7 dry), and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay loam. Some pedons contain diagonal wedges up to 3 inches in width of sandy material. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Bearden, Cubden, Gunclub, and Saunders series. Bearden are varved with thin layers of sand to clay below a depth of 40 inches. Cubden soils have glacial till below 40 inches. Gunclub soils are formed in 40 to 60 inches of lacustrine sediments overlying glacial till. The Saunders soils have electrical conductivity of more than 4mmhos/cm throughout the series control section and has an annual precipitation of 10 to 14 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: McKranz soils are on plane to convex slopes with gradient of 0 to 2 percent on slight rises adjacent to upland drainageways. The soils are formed in 20 to 40 inches of calcareous loess over clay loam glacial till. Mean annual air temperature is 42 to 48 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches. Growing season is about 120 to 160 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from15 to 18 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

The somewhat poorly drained Badger soils have a fine textured control section and are in deeper swales. The well drained Barnes, Kranzburg, and Vienna soils have a cambic horizon and are on convex slopes above the McKranz soils.  The moderately well drained Brooking and Forestville soils have a mollic epipedon more than 16 inches thick and are in slightly higher positions on the landscape. The poorly drained Hidewood soils have thicker mollic epipedons and are in drainagways."

Saturarted hydraulic conductivity, measured in cm per hour, is 1.52 to 5.10 (.6 to 2.0 inches) in the upper mantle and .51 to 1.52 (.2 to .6 inches) in the underlying glacial till. Seasonal saturation occurs as high as 16 to 20 inches during the months of April to June in years of normal precipitation."
