  "OVERVIEW": "The Maupin series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and ash overlying a duripan.  Maupin soils are on mesas or plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

(41 degrees F.) but are moist in the control section more than 60 consecutive days following the winter solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 57 degrees F.  The solum is 20 to 32 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include the upper part of the Bw horizon.  Depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches and depth to bedrock is 25 to 45 inches.  The texture control section is 18 to 25 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is loam or silt loam with 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The soil reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is loam or silt loam, has 18 to 25 percent clay, and has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  The soil reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It is loam, silt loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly silt loam with 0 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent hard nodules.  It has 18 to 25 percent clay.  It is strongly to violently effervescent.  The soil reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe duripan (Bkqm horizon) has nearly continuous to continuous indurated laminar capping.  Other parts of the duripan range from weakly cemented to indurated."
