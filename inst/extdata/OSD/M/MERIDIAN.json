  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy alluvium and depth to sandy outwash ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 45 inches.  The weighted average clay content in the upper part of the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy alluvium and from 0 to 35 percent in the sandy outwash.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.  Reaction naturally ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the solum but ranges to neutral in the surface layer and upper subsoil, where the soil is limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Typically, it is silt loam or loam. Less typically it is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.   Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with color and texture like the Ap horizon.  A horizons less than 7 inches thick have colors like the Ap horizon after mixing to 7 inches.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Typically, it is silt loam or loam but in some pedons it is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 .  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It typically is loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam but includes subhorizons of sandy loam.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sand, loamy sand, coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2BC horizon has color and texture like the 2Bt horizon described above.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6 or it is multicolored.  It is sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly analogs.  The reaction is typically strongly acid to slightly acid.  However, in MLRA-104 and the western part of MLRA-105, the reaction is slighlty acid to slightly alkaline with small amounts of calcium carbonate allowed in the range."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the  Gardenvale, Menomin(T), Merimod, Merit and Sattre series. Gardenvale soils have siliceous sand and a paralithic contact in the lower part of the series control section.  Menomin soils have redox features and an apparent water table in the lower part of the series control section.  Merit soils have siliceous sand in the lower part of the series control section.  Sattre soils have lamellae (E&Bt horizon) in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Meridian soils are on lake terraces and outwash terraces of valley rains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 20 percent.  These soils formed primarily in loamy alluvium overlying sandy outwash.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 135 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1000 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Dakota, Lows, Menomin(T), Rusktown(T), and Shiffer soils.  Dakota soils are on landscape positions similar to those of Meridian soils where the dark colored surface layer is thicker.  The poorly drained Lows soils , the somewhat poorly drained Shiffer soils, and the moderately well drained Menomin soils form a drainage sequence with Meridian soils. The moderately well drained Rusktown soils are in slightly lower landscape positions where there is more sand and less clay in the soil"

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Prior to 1969 the concept of Meridian covered two textural families.  The coarser part is now part of the Billett series.\nThe concept of having free carbonates was added to allow use in other parts of MLRA-104 and 105.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon too dark for the Typic subgroup - 0 to 9 inches (Ap); argillic horizon - 9 to 32 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4).\nNSSL data indicates that Meridian soil have base saturation of 50 percent or more (by NH4OAc) in all horizons between the upper boundary of the argillic and a depth of 125 cm.  However, it is suspected that the very low CEC in the sandy outwash results in drastic changes in base sat. with the addition of a few bases from fertilization in cropland areas.  These soils may classify as Ultic subgroup in their natural state.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil Interpretation Record - WI0248.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
