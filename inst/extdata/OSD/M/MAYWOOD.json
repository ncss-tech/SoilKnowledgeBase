Some of these strata are gravelly or very gravelly and depth to the very gravelly layers is about 40 inches.  Soil temperature is about 62 to 65 degrees F. and mineralogy is mixed.  The soils are dry in the upper 2 or 3 feet for at least 60 consecutive days during most summers. The soil moisture control section (6 to 18 inches) is dry in all parts from approx. May through October (170 to 190 days) and is moist in some or all parts the remainder of the year.\nThe soils are structureless, massive and reaction is slightly alkaline to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, or 2.5Y 6/2 dry. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, or 2.5Y4/3.  It is loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 6/4, or 2.5Y 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, or 2.5Y 4/4, 4/2.   Textures are stratified silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam and loamy fine sand.  There are gravelly or very gravelly layers below about 3 feet 15 to 35 percent rock fragments)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Maywood soils occur on nearly level low terraces or floodplains along small streams which overflow occasionally or frequently.  They occur at elevations of 65 to 1,250 feet, in a dry subhumid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 19 to 35 inches, with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., average January temperature about 47 degrees F., and average July temperature about 80 degrees F.  Frost free season averages about  275 days."
