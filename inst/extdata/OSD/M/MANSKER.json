  "OVERVIEW": "The Mansker series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy, calcareous eolian deposits of the Blackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in) and the mean annual temperature is 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",
