    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 5 to 25 inches.  Depth to horizons with gypsum and salt accumulations ranges from 5 to 16 inches.  The combined thickness of the A and E horizon is 5 inches or less.  The soil has an Ustic moisture regime.  The soil contains 1 to 10 percent rock fragments throughout.\nSome pedons have A horizons 1 to 4 inches thick with hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or silt loam and is slightly acid or neutral.  The E horizon is absent in some pedons that have an Ap horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay or clay averaging more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It has moderate or strong, fine to coarse columnar structure in the upper part.  Most pedons have accumulations of salts, especially in the lower part.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has common or many accumulations of carbonates.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  In some pedons the Bk horizon does not have accumulations of gypsum or other salts.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 8 and 3 to 7 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam or loam but is fine sandy loam in some pedons.  It is moderately or strongly alkaline.  Some pedons have shale bedrock below a depth of 40 inches.  Some pedons have thin strata of sandy loam and gravelly sand below a depth of 40 inches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Adger, Dogtooth, Exline, Ferney and Mekinock soils.  Adger soils have an Ustic moisture regime that borders on Aridic.  Dogtooth and Mekinock soils are moderately deep to residual beds.  Exline, Ferney and Mekinock soils have a Udic moisture regime.  In addition, Exline soils have less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser sand in the particle-size control section and formed in lacustrine sediments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Miranda soils are level to gently sloping on fine-loamy till plains.  Slope gradients typically are less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 9 percent.  The Miranda soils formed in calcareous loam or clay loam till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 34 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 17 inches.  The soils have an Ustic moisture regime.  Growing season is about 110 to 130 days; average growing season precipitation from 13 to 16 inches; and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000.  Elevation ranges from 1600 to 2700 feet above sea level."

Niobell and Noonan soils are on higher parts of the landscapes with microrelief.  Niobell soils do not have columnar structure in the Btn horizon and have tonguing or interfingering of E materials for more than 1 inch into the Btn horizon.  Noonan soils have combined A and E horizons thicker than 5 inches and do not have accumulations of salt within a depth of 16 inches.  Williams soils do not have a natric horizon and are on landscapes above the Miranda soils."
