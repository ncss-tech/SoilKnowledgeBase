The E horizon is absent in some pedons that have an Ap horizon.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay or clay averaging more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It has moderate or strong, fine to coarse columnar structure in the upper part.  Most pedons have accumulations of salts, especially in the lower part.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.

Niobell soils do not have columnar structure in the Btn horizon and have tonguing or interfingering of E materials for more than 1 inch into the Btn horizon.  Noonan soils have combined A and E horizons thicker than 5 inches and do not have accumulations of salt within a depth of 16 inches.  Williams soils do not have a natric horizon and are on landscapes above the Miranda soils."
