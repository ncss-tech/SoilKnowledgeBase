  "OVERVIEW": "The McGarr series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed and basaltic or andesitic colluvium mixed with ash.  McGarr soils are on mountains and hills and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 22\ninches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
