  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Mulvey series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep or very deep to gravelly outwash. Mulvey soils formed in loess and loamy sediments and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are on outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
