  "OVERVIEW": "The Matneflat series consists of very deep, well drained, soils with moderately rapid permeability on uplands. The soils formed in colluvium from sandstone and shale on fans, footslopes, lower mountain ridgetops, and mountain sideslopes. Slopes range from 2 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

The CEC activity class placement may have been based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 9/89\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
