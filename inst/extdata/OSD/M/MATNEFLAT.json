The CEC activity class placement may have been based on similar soils and not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nPrevious revision dates: 9/89\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
