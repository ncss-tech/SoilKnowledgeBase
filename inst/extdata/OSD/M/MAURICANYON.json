    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section:  The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Part of the Bw and Bk horizons)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 72 inches.  (A1, A2, Bw and Bk horizons)\nOther features:  secondary calcium carbonate. (Bk horizon)\nThis series replaces the Manzano series in Las Animas County, Colorado, and in Colfax and Union Counties in New Mexico. These areas average more than 14 inches annual precipitation and are moist during periods that are typically dry as described in the Manzano series. In addition, the Manzano series identified several species that typically grow on alkaline soils in the vegetation section.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition, 1998\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
