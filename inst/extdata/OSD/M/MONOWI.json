  "STATES": "NE",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Monowi series consists of moderately deep, well drained slow or very slowly permeable soils formed in clay residuum weathered from calcareous and gypsiferous shale. These upland soils have slopes ranging from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C, and mean annual precipitation is about 559 millimeters.",
