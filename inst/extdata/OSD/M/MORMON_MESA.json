Crossen soils have 3 to 20 inch thick petrocalcic horizons. Upton soils form in calcareous materials and contain 15 to 30 percent clay in the control section. Woda soils contain 20 to 30 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Mormon Mesa soils are on summits of fan remnants and mesas. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in material influenced by calcareous loess over mixed alluvium from predominantly limestone sources. Elevations are 1,800 to 3,000 feet. The climate is low latitude desert, with mild winters and very hot summers. Precipitation is greatest in the winter with a lesser secondary peak in summer, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual rainfall is 4 to 7 inches. The mean annual temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.; average January temperature is 45 degrees F., and average July temperature is 83 degrees F. The frost free season is 220 to 300 days."

St. Thomas soils are very shallow or shallow over limestone and have loamy-skeletal control sections. Toquop soils are very deep sandy soils."
