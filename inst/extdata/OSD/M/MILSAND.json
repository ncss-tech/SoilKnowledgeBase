  "OVERVIEW": "The Milsand series consists of very deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy aluvial and eolian sediments. These soils are on gently sloping to rolling plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 432 mm (17 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F)",
