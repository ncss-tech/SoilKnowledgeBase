Cracks 1/2 to 1 inch wide extending to depths of 20 to 30 inches occur at some period in most years.\nThe A1 horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2; 10YR 5/3.  It is heavy silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and is moderately or strongly alkaline.  It is massive or has weak very coarse prismatic structure.\nThe B2 horizon is silty clay or clay is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 9.0).\nThe C horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.
