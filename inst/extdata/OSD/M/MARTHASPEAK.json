  "OVERVIEW": "The Marthaspeak series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum derived from sandstone.  Marthaspeak soils are on mesas and cuestas.  Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
