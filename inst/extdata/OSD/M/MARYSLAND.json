  "OVERVIEW": "The Marysland series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in glacial lacustrine, alluvium or outwash sediments which consists of a 20 to 40 inch loamy mantle over sandy or sandy-skeletal sediments.  These soils are on stream terraces, outwash channels, outwash plains, flood plains and lake plains. They have moderate permeability in the upper part and rapid permeability in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 30 inches in thickness.  The depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 0 to 16 inches.  The loamy outwash material ranges from 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  It typically does not have rock fragments, but it contains as much as 10 percent (by volume) mostly in the lower part in some pedons. The 2C horizon contains as much as 40 percent (by volume) of rock fragments.  The rock fragments are of mixed lithology.  The loamy surface horizons average between 18 and 30 percent clay and 20 to 50 percent of fine sand and coarser.  The calcic horizon has calcium carbonate equivalent averaging between 15 and 35 percent.  Free carbonates are in all parts of the control section.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 or 1. It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have an ABkg horizon.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, 4 to 8 dry; chroma of 0 to 2. It typically is mottled in all parts; however, in some pedons the part at about depths of 20 inches does not have mottles but has chroma of 1 or 0.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam but the range includes fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the lower part.  In some pedons, a transitional layer of gravelly sandy loam less than 5 inches thick is between the Bkg and 2Cg horizons.  Some pedons have an Ab horizon or Cg horizon.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  In some pedons, the coarse textured strata below 40 inches have chroma of 4 to 6.  It is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand with as much as 40 percent gravel or are stratified with sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  A 3Cg horizon of finer textured material begins at depths as shallow as 40 inches in a few pedons."

The Spottswood soils have plane or slightly concave slopes and lack a calcic horizon at shallow depths.  The Divide soils have plane or slightly convex slopes."

Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is as high as .5 to 1.5 feet at some time from November through July in most years for the poorly drained phase.  The very poorly drained phase has an apparent high water table at depths of +1.0 to 1.0 feet during January to December in most years."
