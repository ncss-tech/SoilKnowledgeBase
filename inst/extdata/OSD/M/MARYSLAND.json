  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 30 inches in thickness.  The depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 0 to 16 inches.  The loamy outwash material ranges from 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  It typically does not have rock fragments, but it contains as much as 10 percent (by volume) mostly in the lower part in some pedons. The 2C horizon contains as much as 40 percent (by volume) of rock fragments.  The rock fragments are of mixed lithology.  The loamy surface horizons average between 18 and 30 percent clay and 20 to 50 percent of fine sand and coarser.  The calcic horizon has calcium carbonate equivalent averaging between 15 and 35 percent.  Free carbonates are in all parts of the control section.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 or 1. It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have an ABkg horizon.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 5Y to 10YR or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, 4 to 8 dry; chroma of 0 to 2. It typically is mottled in all parts; however, in some pedons the part at about depths of 20 inches does not have mottles but has chroma of 1 or 0.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam but the range includes fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the lower part.  In some pedons, a transitional layer of gravelly sandy loam less than 5 inches thick is between the Bkg and 2Cg horizons.  Some pedons have an Ab horizon or Cg horizon.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  In some pedons, the coarse textured strata below 40 inches have chroma of 4 to 6.  It is fine sand, sand, or coarse sand with as much as 40 percent gravel or are stratified with sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  A 3Cg horizon of finer textured material begins at depths as shallow as 40 inches in a few pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Marysland soils have plane, slightly concave, or slightly convex slopes.  They formed in glacial lacustrine, alluvium or outwash with a 20 to 40 inch upper loamy mantle over sandy and gravelly sediment in drainageways and flats on glacial stream terraces, outwash channels, outwash plains, outwash plains, flood plains and lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches.  Frost-free days range from 100 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 2350 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Renshaw, Fordville, Spottswood, and Divide soils which are members of a hydrosequence with the Marysland soils.  The Renshaw and Fordville soils are well drained and are on higher lying or more sloping terrain.  The Spottswood and Divide soils are moderately well and somewhat poorly drained.  The Spottswood soils have plane or slightly concave slopes and lack a calcic horizon at shallow depths.  The Divide soils have plane or slightly convex slopes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly and very poorly drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is moderate in the upper loamy mantle and rapid in the 2C horizon.  Depth to an apparent seasonal high water table is as high as .5 to 1.5 feet at some time from November through July in most years for the poorly drained phase.  The very poorly drained phase has an apparent high water table at depths of +1.0 to 1.0 feet during January to December in most years."
