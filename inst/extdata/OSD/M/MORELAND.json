COLE values range from .09 to .12 in the upper 40 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2.  Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Some pedons have a surface mantle of new material up to 10 inches thick that has texture of silt loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4; or it has hue of 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2.  Texture is clay or silty clay.  Clay content averages 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkss horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is clay.  Thin lenses of silty clay loam or silty clay are in the Bkss horizon in some pedons.  Clay content averages 60 to 90 percent.  Few to common iron depletions in shades of gray are within 30 inches of the surface.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Concretions or soft masses of calcium carbonate are few to common.  Slickensides are few to common.\nThe BCkss horizon, where present has the same color as the Bkss horizon.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Some pedons have thin strata of silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Slickensides are few or common.  Concretions or masses of calcium carbonate are few or common.\nSome pedons have a buried A horizon between depths of 40 and 80 inches that is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Moreland soils are on flood plains.  They formed in clayey sediments transported by streams from the Permian Red Beds. Most of these soils are protected from stream overflow by levees.  Typically they are level, but some areas of this soil are undulating.  The climate is warm and humid.  Thornthwaite P-E index is greater than 64.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 58 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 70 degrees F."

Buxin soils have a burried A horizon within a depth of 40 inches and are on slightly lower landscape positions.  Billyhaw soils are not saturated within a depth of 40 inches for more than one month in normal years.  Caspiana, Coushatta, Gallion, and Norwood soils are coarser textured and do not have grayish mottles within a depth of 30 inches.  They are on slightly higher landscape positions.  Desha and Portland soils do not have intersecting slickensides within 40 inches.  Latanier soils have a loamy discontinuity within a depth of 40 inches.  Lebeau soils have a dark surface layer that is 8 inches or less in thickness.   Perry soils are grayer and are more strongly acid.  They are on lower landscape positions.  Roebuck soils are wetter and are on slightly lower landscape positions."
