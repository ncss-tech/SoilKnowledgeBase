  "OVERVIEW": "The Martin series consists of deep and very deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands. They formed in colluvium and/or residuum from interbedded silty and clayey shales, limestone, and clay beds. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 86 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
