    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Malinta soils are on flats, depressions, and drainageways on lake plains and deltas of late Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The soils formed in sandy and loamy glaciolacustrine sediments and in the underlying till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (49 to 54 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 244 meters (600 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Malinta soils form a toposequence with the moderately well drained Rimer and Seward soils. Rimer and Seward soils are on higher landform positions. Other nearby soils are the Colwood, Gilford, Granby, Hoytville, Lenawee, and Mermill soils. Colwood, Gilford, and Granby soils do not have till in the lower part of the profile. Hoytville, Lenawee, and Mermill soils have a thinner, dark colored surface layer."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained or very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the sandy material, moderately low in the lower part of the subsoil, and low in the substratum. Permeability is moderately rapid in the sandy material, slow in the lower part of the subsoil, and slow or very slow in the substratum."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Malinta soils are cultivated. Principal crops include corn, soybeans, and small grain with some sugar beets and truck crops. A few undrained areas have dominantly marsh vegetation. Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest with swamp white oak, soft maple, elm, basswood, and sycamore as prominent species."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Malinta series is a tentative series designed to \"reserve\" an alternate classification for the Wauseon series. This OSD is essentially identical to the current Wauseon OSD except for classification at the Great Group level.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, A horizons).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 91 cm (Bg, 2BC horizons).\nDensic contact: at 147 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features present in all horizons below a depth of 33 cm; matrix color with chroma of 1 immediately below the mollic epipedon.\nThe Malinta series needs to be investigated for a contrasting particle-size class during MLRA update activities. Available lab data from adjacent series have 27 to 42 percent clay in the underlying till. Recent sampling of similar series (Rollersville) does not support the contrasting particle-size class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
