They formed in sandy and loamy glaciolacustrine sediments and in the underlying till. They are on lake plains and deltas. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

Hoytville, Lenawee, and Mermill soils have a thinner, dark colored surface layer."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the sandy material, moderately low in the lower part of the subsoil, and low in the substratum. Permeability is moderately rapid in the sandy material, slow in the lower part of the subsoil, and slow or very slow in the substratum."

A few undrained areas have dominantly marsh vegetation. Native vegetation is deciduous swamp forest with swamp white oak, soft maple, elm, basswood, and sycamore as prominent species."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Malinta series is a tentative series designed to \"reserve\" an alternate classification for the Wauseon series. This OSD is essentially identical to the current Wauseon OSD except for classification at the Great Group level.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap, A horizons).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 33 to 91 cm (Bg, 2BC horizons).\nDensic contact: at 147 cm (top of the 2Cd horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features present in all horizons below a depth of 33 cm; matrix color with chroma of 1 immediately below the mollic epipedon.\nThe Malinta series needs to be investigated for a contrasting particle-size class during MLRA update activities. Available lab data from adjacent series have 27 to 42 percent clay in the underlying till. Recent sampling of similar series (Rollersville) does not support the contrasting particle-size class.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
