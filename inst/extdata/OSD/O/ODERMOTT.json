  "OVERVIEW": "The Odermott series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in sediments primarily from acid igneous sources.  Odermott soils are on dissected high terraces.  Slopes are 3 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
