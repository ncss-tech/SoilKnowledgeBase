Haw, Montour, and Van Dusen series have calcareous horizons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Soils formed in old mixed sediments dominated by acid igneous rock sources.  The climate is subhumid continental.  The average frost-free period is 100 to 140 days; and the average annual precipitation is 16 to 23 inches, including 4 to 6 feet of snowfall.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F."
