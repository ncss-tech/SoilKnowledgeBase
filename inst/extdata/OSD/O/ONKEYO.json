  "OVERVIEW": "The Onkeyo series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Onkeyo soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",

The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 to 460 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
