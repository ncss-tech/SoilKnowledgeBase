    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Onkeyo soils are on mountains and hills.  They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,830 to 2,750 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 330 to 460 mm, mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."
