  "OVERVIEW": "The Osha series consists of deep, well drained soils, with moderately rapid permeability. These soils formed in material derived from granite and are on mountain slopes and ridgetops.  Slopes are 3 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 480 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
