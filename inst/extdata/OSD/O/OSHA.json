  "OVERVIEW": "The Osha series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in material derived from granite.  Osha soils are on mountain slopes and ridgetops.  Slopes are 3 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
