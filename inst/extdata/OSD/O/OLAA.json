The soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to hilly `a`a flows that are 1,000 to 11,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 10 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava. Mean annual rainfall is 3,000 to 5,000 millimeters (138 to 200 inches) with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 762 to 1,016 millimeters (30 to 40 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 21 to 25 degrees C (70 to 77 degrees F). The mean annual soil temperature is 22 degrees C or higher (72 degrees F)."
