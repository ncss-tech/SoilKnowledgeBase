The soil between depths of 6 and 15 inches is usually moist in some part from about December 1 until late May and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  The A horizon is yellowish brown, brown or reddish brown (10YR 5/4, 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 4/4).  It is cobbly loam or cobbly sandy loam and has less than 1 percent organic matter below a depth of 4 inches.  This horizon is slightly or medium acid.  The B2t horizon is brown to red (7.5YR 4/4; 5YR 3/4, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6; 2.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 5/6).  This horizon is very cobbly or very gravelly clay with 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  The clay increase at the A-B horizon boundary is 15 to 25 percent (absolute).  This horizon is medium or strongly acid and has 60 to 75 percent base saturation.  The C horizon is cobbly loam or clay loam and is medium or strongly acid."

All of these soils except Keefers have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizons.  Keefers soils lack an abrupt or clear A-B horizon boundary with as much as 15 to 20 percent absolute difference in clay content.  Also, Cometa, Corning, Positas, and Kimball soils have a base saturation of more than 75 percent in the argillic horizon.  Guenoc soils have a lithic contact 20 to 40 inches below the surface.  Placentia soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in the argillic horizon.  Redding soils have a duripan."

Summers are warm and dry and winters are cool and moist.  Mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  Average January temperature is 50 degrees F., average July temperature is 75 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 290 to 330 days."
