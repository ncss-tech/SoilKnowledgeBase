  "OVERVIEW": "The Olac series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Olac soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Cubard, Cottle, Phliss, and Old Camp soils have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Boomstick and Fortyday soils are 36 to 50 cm to bedrock.  Checkett soils are calcareous in all parts.  Gabbvally soils have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Hooplite soils are calcareous.  Nevo soils have secondary silica coats on the lithic contact. Rowel soils have argillic horizons with 40 to 55 percent clay.  Soughe soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Stewval soils are calcareous throughout, have mean annual soil temperature of 12 to 15 degrees C, and are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October.  Thike soils average 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, have more than half 2 to 5 mm gravel, and the sand fraction is dominated by coarse sand."
