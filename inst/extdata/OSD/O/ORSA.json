  "OVERVIEW": "The Orsa series consists of deep well to somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in thick coarse textured materials weathered and locally transported from arkosic materials.  Orsa soils are on alluvial fans, high dissected terraces and valley sideslopes and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 43 centimeters (17 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.) at the type location.",
