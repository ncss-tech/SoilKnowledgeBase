  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Orwood series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in eolian sediments. These soils are on side slopes, interfluves and crests on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 81 centimeters (32 inches).",
