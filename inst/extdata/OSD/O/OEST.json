Badena soils are dominated by cobbles and have 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Badenaugh, Leviathan, Nosrac, Shree, and Shroe soils have more than 25 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Eaglerock, Searvar, and Trid soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, and Searles soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Lemm soils average 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Shawmount soils have a horizon with lamellae below the argillic horizon.  Tollgate soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 10 degrees C. Tristan soils are deep to lithic contacts."
