  "OVERVIEW": "The Oest series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Oest soils are on fan remnants and stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Badena soils are dominated by cobbles and have 60 to 85 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Badenaugh, Leviathan, Nosrac, Shree, and Shroe soils have more than 25 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Eaglerock, Searvar, and Trid soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Gitabyte, Grinrod, Ister, and Searles soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Lemm soils average 10 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Shawmount soils have a horizon with lamellae below the argillic horizon.  Tollgate soils have a mean annual soil temperature less than 10 degrees C. Tristan soils are deep to lithic contacts."
