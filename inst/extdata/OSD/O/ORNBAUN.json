  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to a lithic or paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature ranges from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between depths of 6 and 17 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1 and is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages from 25 to 35 percent clay and from 15 to 35 percent soft fragments of sandstone.  Base saturation ranges from 40 to 75 percent throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, or 7.5YR 3/2.  Soft sandstone fragments content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Where mollic colors occur, the layer is too thin to meet the requirements for a mollic epipedon.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 6/4, 6/6, 7/3, 7/4; 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6 7/4, 7/6; 5YR 5/6 or 6/6.  Moist color is 10YR 4/6, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6, 7/6; 5YR 4/6 or 5/6.  It is loam or clay loam.  Clay textures are below the particle-size control section.  Clay content ranges from 20 to 50 percent (increasing with increasing depth).  Soft sandstone fragment content ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Fragments slake in water.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid."

Inverness soils have C horizons above a paralithic contact and contain 5 to 20 percent mica flakes.  Crispin and Zeni soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Cabrillo soils are very deep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ornbaun soils occur on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 9 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 200 to 2,500 feet.  The soils formed in material weathered from feldspathic or micaceous sandstone and mudstone.  The climate is subhumid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A moderate coastal fog influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 220 to 320 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the surface layer from 0 to 3 inches.\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 59 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Bt4 horizons)\nParalithic material, when present, has a similar available water capacity and bulk density to the overlying B horizon.  Soft sandstone fragments in the Bt horizon are not recognized in the textural class as they do not affect engineering properties in the same manner as hard gravels.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in February of 2003. Competing series were not checked at that time. - ET\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Complete lab characterization of typical pedon:  NSSL Lab Sample Nos. - 80P2469-2475.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
