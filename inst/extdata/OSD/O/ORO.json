The soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary rock with some addition of eolian material.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 13 inches, with a marked summer maximum characterized by heavy thunderstorms of short duration.  In a few areas the precipitation is higher. The frost-free season ranges from 115 to 160 days and elevation of ranges from 6,500 to 7,200 feet."
