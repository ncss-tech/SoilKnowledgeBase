  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock ranges from 8 to 20 inches;  The soil typically is slightly hard and friable and ranges from soft to hard and from friable to firm.  The soil is slightly or moderately alkaline throughout and has a calcium carbonate equivalent ranging from 5 to 15 percent.  COLE ranges from 0.05 to 0.10.  The underlying shale contains varying amounts of gypsum and other salts.  Plant roots are few to many and extend into the upper part of the underlying shale.  Some pedons have stones and boulders on the surface.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay or clay.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay or clay averaging between 45 and 55 percent clay and 35 and 50 percent silt.  Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum.\nThe C horizon has the same color as the AC horizon and is clay or silty clay that contains from 35 to 90 percent by volume of shale fragments.  Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The shale chips are brittle, noncohesive and are loose.  Calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, and other salts are in cracks and along cleavage planes of the shale.  The shale is mildly or moderately alkaline."

Lakoma soils have shale between depths of 20 and 40 inches and are on more stable landscapes above or below the the Okaton soils in the landscape.  Murdo soils are on similar topography above the Okaton soils and have sand and gravel between depths of 12 and 20 inches.  Sansarc soils have less carbonates, contain more clay, and are on similar topography below the Okaton soils.  Schamber soils are sandy-skeletal and are on ridges and terrace fronts above the Okaton soils."
