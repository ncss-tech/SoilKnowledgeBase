  "OVERVIEW": "The Oleno series consists of poorly drained, slowly permeable\nsoils that formed in clayey fluvial sediments over loamy deposits\non the flood plains of the coastal plains.  These soils are on\nnearly level flood plains immediately adjacent to streams, creeks, and rivers.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.",

These areas are cracks when the soil is dry.\nThe IIA2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 7, chroma of 1 or\n2.  Light gray mottles range from none to many.  Fresh water shell deposits are in this horizon in some pedons.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline.  Texture is sand,\nloamy sand, or fine sandy loam, and some small pockets of sandy\nclay loam.\nThe IIB horizons have hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 3 through 7,\nchroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or gray\nrange from few to many.  Texture of the IIB1g horizon is sandy\nloam or fine sandy loam.  The IIB2g horizon is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.
