Reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid.\nTexture is clay.\nThe B horizons have hue of 10YR or neutral, value of 2 to 6,\nchroma of 1.  Dark gray mottles range from none to many in the\nlower part.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.  Texture is clay.  Vertical streaks of dark gray colored surface materials are present when the soil is moist.  These areas are cracks when the soil is dry.\nThe IIA2 horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 7, chroma of 1 or\n2.  Light gray mottles range from none to many.  Fresh water shell deposits are in this horizon in some pedons.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to mildly alkaline.  Texture is sand,\nloamy sand, or fine sandy loam, and some small pockets of sandy\nclay loam.\nThe IIB horizons have hue of 10YR or 5Y, value of 3 through 7,\nchroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or gray\nrange from few to many.  Texture of the IIB1g horizon is sandy\nloam or fine sandy loam.  The IIB2g horizon is sandy clay loam or sandy clay.  The clay content of the IIB2g horizon ranges from 22\nto 40 percent.\nThe IIICg horizon, where present, has hue of 5BG or 5B, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Shell fragments range from none to many.  Reaction ranges from medium\nacid to mildly alkaline."
