The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 46 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is 10 to 25 percent volcanic glass and cinders, 35 to 50 percent pebbles, and 10 to 30 percent cobbles by volume.  Depth to densic material is 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or  moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through  4 moist or dry.  It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry,  It is very gravelly loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  Some pedons have few to common medium faint bright colored mottles. Dry consistence is hard or very hard.  Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or very cobbly sandy loam."
