The moisture control section is usually dry, but is moist in some part 25 to 40 percent of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  It is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loamy sand, gravelly sand or sand.  Durinodes range from 5 to 30 percent about half of which are strongly cemented.  Moist consistence in the B horizon ranges from friable to very firm, but is firm and brittle in some part of the horizon when there is less than 20 percent durinodes.  It is moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry or moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is gravelly coarse sand, sand, or gravelly sand.  The C horizon is moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous and strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline."

The Hiko Peak and Cliffdown soils formed in mixed alluvium on terraced bajadas and have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Hiko Springs soils are coarse-loamy, do not have brittle matrix in any horizon and are on terraced bajadas.  The Shabliss soils are on the dissected bajada above the high lake terrace and have a continuously cemented duripan.  The Skumpah soils are on a lake plain and have a natric horizion."
