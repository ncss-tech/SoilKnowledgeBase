  "OVERVIEW": "The Oakcreek series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a loamy mantle and underlying sandy and gravelly outwash sediments on outwash plains and valley trains.  Permeability is moderate to moderately rapid in the upper part and rapid in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",
