    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to free carbonates is 24 to 60 inches or more. Rock fragments comprise 0 to 10 percent of the upper loamy mantle and 10 to 35 percent of the lower sandy sediment.  Rock fragments are of mixed lithology and mostly pebble size.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have an E or B/E horizon.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  The upper part is loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam.  The lower part includes textures of sandy loam, coarse sandy loam and fine sandy loam.   The Bt horizon averages between 18 to 27 percent clay and 35 to 55 percent sand.  It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt or 2Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, sand or their gravelly analogues. It is moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues.  Some subhorizons consist of strata of fine sand or loamy fine sand.  It is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Oakcreek soils have slightly concave or plane slopes on outwash plains or valley trains.   They are formed in glacial outwash consisting of a loamy mantle 24 to 40 inches and the underlying sandy and gravelly sediments.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These sediments are Late Wisconsin in age. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches.  Annual frost free days range from 90 to 140 days.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1500 feet."

The well drained Almora, Dorset, and Verndale soils and the excessively drained Corliss soils are on more convex slopes on higher lying areas on the landscape. The moderately well drained Oylen have less clay in the subsoil and have similar landscape positions.  The poorly drained Pinelake soils are in swales and depressions."
