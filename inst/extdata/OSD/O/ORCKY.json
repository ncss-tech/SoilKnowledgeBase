  "OVERVIEW": "The Orcky series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Orcky soils are on alluvial fans, lake terraces, and terrace escarpments.  Slope ranges from 4 to 40 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry but are moist in some part of the moisture control section for 40 to 50 percent of the time that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  They are continually dry for 70 to 80 days during the summer months.\nDepth of the A and Bw horizons range from 11 to 20 inches.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 25 percent in the calcic horizon.\nThe upper part of the particle-size control section averages between 10 and 18 percent clay and has less than 50 percent sand that is fine sand or coarser. The lower part of the particle-size control section ranges from sand to extremely gravelly loamy sand and has as much as 70 percent pebbles.\nThe A horizon has values of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  Textures range from gravelly loam to gravelly fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has values of 6 or 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist; chromas are 2 through 4.  Textures range from gravelly loam to gravelly fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe texture of the 2Bk horizon ranges from loamy sand to extremely gravelly sand.  It has more than 35 percent rock fragments."
