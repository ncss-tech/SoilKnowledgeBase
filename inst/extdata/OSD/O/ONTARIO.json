Wampsville soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section.\nThe Aurora, Cazenovia, Conesus, Danley, Hilton, Honeoye, Lima, Madrid, and Mohawk series are similar soils in related families. Honeoye soils have solum less than 81 cm (32 in). Aurora, Conesus, Danley, and Nunda soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 25 cm (10 in) of the argillic horizon. Cazenovia soils have more than 28 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Hilton and Lima soils have redox features within a depth of 102 cm (40 in).

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A new pedon from Genesee County was selected in 2003 because the typical pedon does not match the typical pedon for Ontario in the Ontario County, NY Soil Survey. After a review of the use of the Ontario and Lansing series for the range of the color hue in the Bt, the requirement that at least one subhorizon be 7.5YR or redder was added in 2006 to Ontario and the competing series section of Ontario and Lansing were adjusted to reflect the change.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 20 cm (8 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 36 to 99 cm (14 to 39 in) (Bt/E and Bt horizons).\n3. Glossic subgroup - as evidenced by interfingering of albic material around peds in the upper part of the argillic horizon (Bt/E horizon) and mean annual soil temperature less than 10 degrees C."
