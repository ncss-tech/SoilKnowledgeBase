Structure is very weak and moderate medium or fine granular and consistence is friable to very friable. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam. The material is massive or has weak platy or fine to coarse blocky structure.\nThe Bt/E horizon has colors  similar to the E and Bt horizons. Texture is loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam, averaging 18 to 28 percent clay. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Clay films cover 5 to 30 percent of ped faces and line pores\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Ontario is 7.5YR or redder in at least one subhorizon in the Bt. Texture is loam, silt loam, or sandy clay loam, averaging 18 to 28 percent clay. Structure is moderate or strong, medium or coarse blocky. Consistence is friable or firm. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral. Clay films cover 5 to 30 percent of ped faces and line pores.\nThe C or Cd horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Consistence is friable to very firm. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam or gravelly analogs. It is slightly to strongly alkaline and slightly to violently effervescent till having thin or thick weak or moderate plate like divisions or the material is massive."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Lansing soils are 10YR or yellower in all subhorizons of the Bt. Wampsville soils are stratified in the lower part of the series control section.\nThe Aurora, Cazenovia, Conesus, Danley, Hilton, Honeoye, Lima, Madrid, and Mohawk series are similar soils in related families. Honeoye soils have solum less than 81 cm (32 in). Aurora, Conesus, Danley, and Nunda soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 25 cm (10 in) of the argillic horizon. Cazenovia soils have more than 28 percent clay in the Bt horizon. Hilton and Lima soils have redox features within a depth of 102 cm (40 in). Madrid soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control sections. Mohawk soils have Ap horizons with moist color value of 3 or less."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A new pedon from Genesee County was selected in 2003 because the typical pedon does not match the typical pedon for Ontario in the Ontario County, NY Soil Survey. After a review of the use of the Ontario and Lansing series for the range of the color hue in the Bt, the requirement that at least one subhorizon be 7.5YR or redder was added in 2006 to Ontario and the competing series section of Ontario and Lansing were adjusted to reflect the change.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 20 cm (8 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Argillic horizon - the zone from 36 to 99 cm (14 to 39 in) (Bt/E and Bt horizons).\n3. Glossic subgroup - as evidenced by interfingering of albic material around peds in the upper part of the argillic horizon (Bt/E horizon) and mean annual soil temperature less than 10 degrees C.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
