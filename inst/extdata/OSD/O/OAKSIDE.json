  "OVERVIEW": "The Oakside series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasedimentary and sedimentary rocks. These soils are on mountains and have slopes of 50 to 110 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 1500 millimeters (59 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
