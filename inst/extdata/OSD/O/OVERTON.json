  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 25 percent but any one horizon has less than 5 percent secondary calcium carbonate.  pH ranges from 8.2 to 9.4.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 67 degrees F.  The soil is moist more than half the time and is usually saturated for periods longer than one month during the spring unless drained.  The control section is dominantly silty clay or clay but has thin (less than 6 inches thick) strata of material ranging from clay loam to loamy fine sand in some pedons.  It ranges from 35 to 60 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, but never both 5 dry and 3 moist after crushing, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap horizon has weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure and the lower part of the A horizon has weak medium to very coarse prismatic structure that parts to weak or moderate subangular or angular blocky.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is mottled with common or many, fine to large high chroma greenish and bluish mottles and some low chroma mottles.  The lower part of the C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is also mottled, similar to the upper part of the C horizon.  Lime is usually well disseminated but fine or medium soft lime masses are in the lower part of the A1 or upper part of the C horizon in some pedons.  Gypsum and salt crystals are in most pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Overton soils are on smooth, nearly level flood plains at elevations of about 1,400 feet.  Slopes are commonly less than 0.3 percent, but range up to 1 percent.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary rocks and reworked lacustrine material. The climate is arid and hot.  The mean annual rainfall is 4 to 6 inches.  Average annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., January temperature about 45 degrees F., and July temperature about 83 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 240 days."

Calico soils have a coarse-loamy over fine textured control section and lack mottles in the coarse-loamy material.  Toquop soils have a sandy control section and are never saturated.  Virgin River soils are never saturated and lack mottles above a depth of 20 inches."

The principal vegetation where not irrigated is quailbush, mesquite, fourwing saltbush, and saltgrass.  These areas are used for limited livestock grazing."
