    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F.  These soils are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 45 percent sand and includes increasing percentages of saprolitic material with depth with percentages, ranging from 5 to 40 percent.  The hard rock, mostly quartzitic and amphibolite, averages 20 to 35 percent in the control section, but ranges to 45 percent in some subhorizons.\nThe A1 horizon, when present, has value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  Hard rock fragments range from 20 to 50 percent and include pebbles and cobbles;  soft fragments range from 5 to 20 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  The texture of the fine earth fraction is loam or sandy loam.  It has 15 to 35 percent hard pebbles and 5 to 15 percent hard cobbles in the upper part and 15 to 30 percent hard pebbles and 0 to 10 percent hard cobbles in the lower part.   It has 5 to 40 percent soft saprolite fragments with the larger amounts in the lower part.  It is slightly acid or moderately acid."

Similar series in other families are Aits, Apex, Canteen, Centralpeak, Leadpoint, Moonville, Moscow, Moso, Osborn, Roslyn, Volperie, and Waits series.  Switchback soils are dry for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  Aits, Apex, Canteen, Moonville, Moso, Roslyn, and Waits soils lack bedrock within depth of 40 inches.  Centralpeak soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days and have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR in the 2Bw horizon.  Leadpoint soils are neutral or mildly alkaline and have colors with a value of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 throughout.  Moscow and Moso soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the control section and the lower part of the control section has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  Osborn soils have a 7 or 8 inch thick volcanic ash mantle and are 45 to 70 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Volperie soils are dry 60 to 75 days, are 5 to 15 percent mica in the particle-size control section, and have a 7 to 13 inch thick volcanic ash mantle."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ojibway soils are on mountains and have slopes of 30 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in mixed colluvium and residual material mainly from amphibolite with a admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  Elevations are 2,600 to 4,750 feet.  The average annual temperature ranges from 43 to 45 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches and the frost-free season ranges from 90 to 110 days."
