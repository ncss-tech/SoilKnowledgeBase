  "OVERVIEW": "The Obskel series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in weathered tephra over residuum and colluvium from coarse grained metamorphic rocks, mainly metadiorite.  Obskel soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on metamorphic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 75 inches, (1905 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F, (11 degrees C).",
