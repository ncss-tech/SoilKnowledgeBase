  "OVERVIEW": "The Ogral series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Ogral soils are on the lower portions of the pediment footslopes and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

Canoto, Cavespring, Spellacy, Storybook and Yermo soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30), receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November. Canutio soils have 25 percent or more gravel and cobbles in the upper 18 inches and have hue mainly in the 10YR to 7.5YR range. Emot soils have textures finer than fine sandy loam and have hues of 7.5YR or 10YR."

These soils formed in mixed alluvial deposits weathered mostly from limestone.  The soils are in arid climate with annual precipitation ranging from 6 to 12 inches with most of this coming from June through August.  The mean January temperature is 43 degrees F. and the mean annual July temperature is 80 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 58 to  62 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 200 to 220 days."
