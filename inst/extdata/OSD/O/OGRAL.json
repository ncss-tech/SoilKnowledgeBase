Canoto, Cavespring, Spellacy, Storybook and Yermo soils are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30), receive mostly winter precipitation and are usually dry from April through November. Canutio soils have 25 percent or more gravel and cobbles in the upper 18 inches and have hue mainly in the 10YR to 7.5YR range. Emot soils have textures finer than fine sandy loam and have hues of 7.5YR or 10YR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ogral soils are on broad alluvial pediment footslopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 4,800 feet.  These soils formed in mixed alluvial deposits weathered mostly from limestone.  The soils are in arid climate with annual precipitation ranging from 6 to 12 inches with most of this coming from June through August.  The mean January temperature is 43 degrees F. and the mean annual July temperature is 80 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 58 to  62 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 200 to 220 days."
