  "OVERVIEW": "The Ontko series consists of very deep, very poorly or poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from tuff, diatomite, and volcanic ash.  Ontko soils are on flood plains and in basins.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
