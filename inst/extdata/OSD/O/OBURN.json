    "content": "REMARKS:  Soil Interpretations Record:  MT0206.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  an ochric epipedon from the soil surface to 7 inches, mixed (A, E horizons); an albic horizon from 1 to 7 inches (E horizon); an argillic horizon from 7 to 19 inches (Bt, Btn horizon); horizons of sodium accumulation from 14 to 36 inches (Btn, Bny horizons); a discontinuity at 36 to 60 inches; a particle-size control section that is the argillic horizon 7 to 19 inches (Bt, Btn horizons).  Oburn soils have a frigid temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime that borders on aridic.\nClassification changed from Borollic Natrargids to Typic Natriboralfs in 1993.  A preferred classification is Glossic Aridic Natriboralfs.  An amendment to Soil Taxonomy is being proposed to provide for these subgroups.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
