    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of recent volcanic ash ranges from 6 to 24 inches.  In places, a thin layer of alluvial silt may overlie the ash.  The texture of the uppermost layer may be loamy fine sand.  The buried layer of fine textured alluvium ranges in thickness from 15 to more than 30 inches.  Thin seams of peat and or sand may occur in this layer."

Average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 70 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Temperatures below freezing are recorded on fewer than 40 days annually, and temperatures above 70 degrees F. are rare."

Pasagshak soils consist of recent volcanic ash and very shallow silty alluvial material over coarse sand and gravel.  Saltery soils consist of sedge peat with lenses of volcanic ash."
