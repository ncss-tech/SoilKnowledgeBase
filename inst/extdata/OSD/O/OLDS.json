  "OVERVIEW": "The Olds series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in volcanic ash overlying clayey alluvium underlain by sand and gravel.  Olds soils are in shallow depressions on floodplains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 60 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of recent volcanic ash ranges from 6 to 24 inches.  In places, a thin layer of alluvial silt may overlie the ash.  The texture of the uppermost layer may be loamy fine sand.  The buried layer of fine textured alluvium ranges in thickness from 15 to more than 30 inches.  Thin seams of peat and or sand may occur in this layer."
