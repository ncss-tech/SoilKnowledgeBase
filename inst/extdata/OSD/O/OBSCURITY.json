The particle-size control section is weakly stratified and averages 35 to 65 coarse fragments and 15 to 50 percent pumice, volcanic glass, and glass aggregates.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.  Some profiles contain woody organic debris composed of logs, branches, and bark.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry.\nThe C2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 moist, 3 to 6 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry.

Alflack and Ragamuffin soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Chena, Castlepeak, Howardsville, Graylock, Mirror Lake, Nataga, Nizina, Pirapeak, and Stecum soils lack volcanic ash in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Chena soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 30 degrees F.  Graylock soils have a chroma of 3 or 4 in the control section, lack basalt fragments, and have granitic rock fragments in the control section.  Mirror Lake soils have 35 to 70 percent quartzite and sandstone fragments in the control section and have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the C horizon.  Cryomont soils have an A horizon with more than 60 percent volcanic ash.  Legault soils are shallow to bedrock.  Stecum soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  kCanladore soils have an albic horizon.  Studebaker soils lack stratification in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Obscurity soils are on broad fans, low terraces, and along major drainages south of Mt. St. Helens at elevations of 2,800 to 5,500 feet.  Obscurity soils formed in mud flow material as the result of melting snow and ice following the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens.  The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 125 to 135 inches including considerable snowfall.  Average January temperature is 25 degrees F; average July temperature is 58 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 70 to 90 days."
