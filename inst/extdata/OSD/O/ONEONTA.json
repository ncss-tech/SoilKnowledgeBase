The type location was moved from Multnomah County to Douglas County. The date of this move is unknown. The classification was changed from medial Andic Cryumbrepts to Typic Haplocryands in a previous draft.\n06/2016--Additional samples of Oneonta soils from Douglas County and the Willamette National Forest should be collected to determine if the criteria for the Alic Haplocryands subgroup is met and if volcanic ash is present in Douglas County. Strong consideration should be given to the Alic subgroup. The soils are assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) for andic soil properties, in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence."
