    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon\n*Particle-size control section--zone from 5 to 105 cm\n*Umbric epipedon--zone from mineral soil surface to a depth of 91 cm\n*Cambic horizon--zone from 51 to 160 cm\n*Andic soil properties--throughout profile (based on data from associated Keel and Lempira series)\nThe Haplocryands classification is based on the soils not meeting the organic carbon content/thickness requirement for melanic/fulvic; below a depth of 30 cm, the organic carbon content is less than 4 percent. The type location was moved from Multnomah County to Douglas County. The date of this move is unknown. The classification was changed from medial Andic Cryumbrepts to Typic Haplocryands in a previous draft.\n06/2016--Additional samples of Oneonta soils from Douglas County and the Willamette National Forest should be collected to determine if the criteria for the Alic Haplocryands subgroup is met and if volcanic ash is present in Douglas County. Strong consideration should be given to the Alic subgroup. The soils are assumed to meet criteria 2 (no ash required) for andic soil properties, in the 12th edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. It is also assumed that enough ash is present for the soils to meet criteria 3. Additional lab data is needed to confirm the degree of ash influence.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data--pedon number FS62Ore-045-16-1-7, Oregon State University\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
