  "OVERVIEW": "The Ocud series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Ocud soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Orhood soils have hue of 7.5YR.  Reywat soils have accumulation of identifiable secondary carbonates above the bedrock contact.  Upatad soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates, and have lithic contacts at depths of 36 to 50 cm."
