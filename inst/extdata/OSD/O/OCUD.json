Duco soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Horseflat soils have mollic epipedons 30 to 43 cm thick and have silica coating the lithic contact.  Orhood soils have hue of 7.5YR.  Reywat soils have accumulation of identifiable secondary carbonates above the bedrock contact.  Upatad soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section, have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates, and have lithic contacts at depths of 36 to 50 cm."
