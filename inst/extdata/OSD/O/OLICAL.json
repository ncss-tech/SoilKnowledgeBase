These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days.  Depth to the Bk horizon is 15 to 44 inches, but is dominantly 15 to 24 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact with basalt is 40 to more than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay in the fine earth fraction.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizons have a value of 4 or 5 when dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 when dry or moist.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  Reaction is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 when moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or loam and averages 0 to 40 percent pebbles and cobbles.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline, contains few medium to common very fine or fine lime segregations, and has less than 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."
