  "OVERVIEW": "The Oakes series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in volcanic ash and colluvium and slope alluvium from bedrock, glacial drift, or volcanic mudflow.  Oakes soils are on glacially modified colluvial mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 5 to 80 percent.   The average annual precipitation is about 75 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  The solum is 20 to 40 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock, dense glacial till or dense volcanic mudflow, is 40 to more than 60 inches.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the four months that follow the summer solstice on 6 or more years out of 10.  Volcanic ash influences the upper 24 to 60 inches of the soil.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments and includes pebbles, cobbles, and stones.  Less than 15 percent of the rock fragments are phyllite.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 2 through 6 dry.\nThe BS horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist, 4 through 6 dry.  The fine earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam.  Rock fragments average from 35 to 70 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist, 3 through 6 dry.  The fine earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  Rock fragments average from 40 to 75 percent.  Some pedons have a 2Cr horizon with dense volcanic mudflow below 40 inches."

Cupples and Montborne soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact of dense compact glacial till.  Danforth soils have a udic moisture regime.  Deroux, Littlejohn, Olomount, Rinker, and Winnecook soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Natkim and Roxer soils have a 7 to 14 inch thick mantle of volcanic ash.

The soils formed in volcanic ash and slope alluvium and mixed colluvium from siltstone, sandstone, conglomerate, andesite, argillite, and glacial drift or volcanic mudflow.  Oakes soils are in a marine climate with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Snow cover lasts from January through March.  Average annual precipitation is 65 to 90 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 32 degrees F. and mean July temperature is about 59 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 170 days."
