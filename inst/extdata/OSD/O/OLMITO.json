  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to contrasting strata of silt loam or very fine sandy loam ranges from 40 to 80 inches.  These soils, when dry, have cracks from 0.4 to 1.0 inch wide and 12 inches or more long that extend to depths of 24 to 40 inches.  COLE ranges from 0.07 to 0.15 throughout the solum.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 32 inches in thickness.  The 10- to 40-inch control section is silty clay or silty clay loam with a clay content of 35 to 55 percent and a sand content of 2 to 12 percent.  Soil salinity increases with depth and ranges from 1 to 4 mmhos/cm in the upper 1 foot, 1 to 6 mmhos/cm between 1 and 3 feet and 3 to 10 mmhos/cm below.\nThe A horizon is dark gray (10YR 4/1), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or dark brown (7.5YR 4/2; 10YR 4/3).\nThe B horizon is dark brown (10YR 4/3; 7.5YR 4/2), brown (10YR 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2), gray (10YR 5/1), or grayish brown (10YR 5/2). The B horizon is silty clay or silty clay loam.  It has weak to moderate subangular blocky and angular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon is pale brown (10YR 6/3), very pale brown (10YR 7/3), light brown (7.5YR 6/4), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2). It is a silty clay or silty clay loam.  Visible secondary calcium carbonate in the C horizons is 5 to 20 percent in the form of soft masses and concretions.  Depth to a calcic horizon is 24 to 40 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no series in the same family. Similar soils include Cameron, Dant, Harlingen, Knippa, Krum, Laredo, and Raymondville series.  Cameron soils have contrasting clayey over loamy 10- to 40-inch control sections.  Dant soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Harlingen soils contain intersecting slickensides within 40 inches and have moist values of more than 3.5.  Knippa and Krum soils have mean annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  Laredo soils have less than 35 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Raymondville soils have mollic epipedons that average less than 20 inches in thickness and they contain more than 12 percent sand in the 10- to 40-inch control section."

The soil formed in stratified calcareous loamy and clayey sediments many feet thick.  The climate is dry subhumid to semiarid.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 74 to 76 degrees F.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 22 to about 34."
