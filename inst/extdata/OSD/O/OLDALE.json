  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Clegorpass (CA) and Rockhound (CA) series. Clegorpass soils have gypsum in the surface layer and the argillic horizon. In addition, Clegorpass soils typically have secondary carbonates and silica expressed as coats or films on rock fragments or as discontinuous, weakly to moderately cemented banding within the matrix in horizons below the argillic horizon. Rockhound soils do not receive appreciable summer precipitation, are generally dry throughout the moisture control section for most of the year and have a mean annual soil temperature (MAST) greater than 25 degrees C (77 degrees F)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oldale soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. These soils formed in eolian material over alluvium from granitoid and or gneissic rocks. Elevations are 200 to 800 meters (655 to 2,625 feet). The climate is arid with hot, dry summers and warm, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 75 to 125 millimeters (3 to 5 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is 20 to 23 degrees C (68 to 73.5 degrees F). The frost-free season is 300 to 340 days."
