  "OVERVIEW": "The Oldale series consists of very deep, well-drained soils that formed in eolian material over alluvium from granitoid and/or gneissic rocks. Oldale soils are on fan remnants. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",

In addition, Clegorpass soils typically have secondary carbonates and silica expressed as coats or films on rock fragments or as discontinuous, weakly to moderately cemented banding within the matrix in horizons below the argillic horizon. Rockhound soils do not receive appreciable summer precipitation, are generally dry throughout the moisture control section for most of the year and have a mean annual soil temperature (MAST) greater than 25 degrees C (77 degrees F)."
