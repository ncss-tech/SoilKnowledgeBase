Typic Torriorthents are found in the channels between remnants, are sandy throughout the particle size control section and do not have an argillic horizon or calcic horizon. Daisy and Gravesumit soils are on fan aprons and alluvial fans over fan remnants. Daisy soils have greater than 50 cm of sand overlying the argillic horizon and Gravesumit soils are not skeletal. Noagua soils are on alluvial fans over fan remnants, have a duripan horizon and are not skeletal."
