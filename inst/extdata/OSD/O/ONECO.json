  "OVERVIEW": "The Oneco series consists of deep, well drained soils on till plains, and uplands. These soils formed in loess, drift, and residuum weathered from limestone. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches).",

The loess typically is 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches) thick, the drift is 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick, and their combined thickness is about 91 to 127 cm (36 to 50 inches). The depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) and is considered to be a lithic contact. The\ndominant clay mineral in the loess and upper part of the 2Bt horizon is smectite. Illite increases with depth and becomes the dominant clay mineral in the lower part of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam.\nThe E horizon (where present) is silt loam.\nThe BE and/or Bt horizon (where present) has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically silty clay loam but ranges to silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 5. Hue of 5YR or redder is present on ped surfaces or in the matrix in at least one subhorizon. It is typically clay loam but includes thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam with moderate content of sand in some pedons. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay or clay with a variable content of chert. Content of clay commonly ranges from 45 to 70 percent. The finest textured horizon is below 91 cm (3 feet) and commonly is the deepest horizon in the solum."

Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 810mm to 910mm (32 to 36 inches).
