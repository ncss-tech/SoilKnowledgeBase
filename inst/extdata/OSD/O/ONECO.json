    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum commonly is 102 to 127 cm (40 to 50 inches) thick but ranges to 152 cm (60 inches). The loess typically is 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches) thick, the drift is 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick, and their combined thickness is about 91 to 127 cm (36 to 50 inches). The depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) and is considered to be a lithic contact. The\ndominant clay mineral in the loess and upper part of the 2Bt horizon is smectite. Illite increases with depth and becomes the dominant clay mineral in the lower part of the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam.\nThe E horizon (where present) is silt loam.\nThe BE and/or Bt horizon (where present) has a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is typically silty clay loam but ranges to silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 5. Hue of 5YR or redder is present on ped surfaces or in the matrix in at least one subhorizon. It is typically clay loam but includes thin subhorizons of sandy clay loam, or silty clay loam with moderate content of sand in some pedons. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is silty clay or clay with a variable content of chert. Content of clay commonly ranges from 45 to 70 percent. The finest textured horizon is below 91 cm (3 feet) and commonly is the deepest horizon in the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oneco soils are on undulating to rolling till plains and moraines that are partially controlled by the underlying limestone bedrock. Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent. These soils formed 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches) of loess,  51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of Late Sangamon age paleosols that formed in Illinoian drift, and 5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 inches) of residuum from weathered limestone bedrock. Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 10 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F).  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 810mm to 910mm (32 to 36 inches).  Frost-free period ranges from 140 to 160 days."

Permeability is moderate in the loess and slow in the residuum. Surface runoff potential is low to medium as related to slope."
