  "OVERVIEW": "The Orphant series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from dominantly volcanic rocks.  Orphant soils are on fan piedmonts and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
