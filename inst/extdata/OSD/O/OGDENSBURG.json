  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum ranges from 15 to 34 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches; depth to carbonates usually corresponds to depth of solum, however, carbonates are absent in some pedons. Rock fragments range from 2 to 35 percent in the Ap, Bw and Bg horizons and from 15 to 50 percent in the BC and C horizons. Rock fragments (gravel and channers) exceed 15 percent in at least one subhorizon of the solum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Dry color value is 5. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Thin subhorizons of silt loam occur in some pedons. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Thin subhorizons of silt loam occur in some pedons. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.\nThe BC and C horizons if present, are neutral or have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 0 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam. Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nBedrock is dolomitic sandstone, limestone, or sandstone."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Firth, Hagensville, Onstad, Sundell and the Tolna soils were in the same family, but have not been classified for CEC reaction class. None of these soils occur in Land Resource Region R. In addition, the Firth, Hagensville, Onstad, and Tolna soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock. Sundell soils are non-gravelly throughout the solum, have a B/A horizon and lack Bg horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ogdensburg soils are on flat or concave areas of till planes where the glacial till regolith is relatively thin over flat lying calcareous sedimentary bedrock. The till is late Wisconsin age and is mostly derived from limestone, dolomitic sandstone, and sandstone. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent, but is commonly 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 150 days. The elevation ranges from 300 to 1000 feet above sea-level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Grenville, Hannawa, Hogansburg, Malone, Nehasne, Quetico, Runeberg and Summerville soils. The Grenville and Hogansburg soils are on the convex tops and sides of hills and ridges and are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock. The Hannawa soils are on slightly lower topographic positions, are less than 20 inches deep, and have distinct or prominent redoximorphic features in the mollic epipedon. The Malone soils are on similar topographic positions on adjacent landscapes, but are deeper than 60 inches to bedrock. The Nehasne, Quetico and Summerville soils are on higher, more convex landscape positions. In addition, they do not have mollic epipedons. The Runeberg soils are on lower positions on nearby landscapes and are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock."
