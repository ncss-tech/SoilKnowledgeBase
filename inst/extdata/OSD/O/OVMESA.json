  "OVERVIEW": "The Ovmesa series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from gypsum and shale.  Ovmesa soils are on plains, hills, pediments, and structural benches.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Changes to the soil moisture control section in the Rekop series excludes the southeastern Colorado area.\n11/2006 WAW  After review of the series by the NSSC staff it was sugested this soil is a Gypsid.  It borders to a Calcigypsid, however, the calcium content decreases with depth and is considered as non-pedogenic accumulations.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy 10th Ed. 2006"
