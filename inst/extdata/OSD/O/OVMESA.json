(Cr1 horizon)\nOther features:  Gypsic mineralogy, with gypsum plus calcium ranging from 40 to 60 percent.\nUstic aridic moisture regime\nRemarks:  The Ovmesa soil was originally included in the Rekop series in Las Animas County.  Changes to the soil moisture control section in the Rekop series excludes the southeastern Colorado area.\n11/2006 WAW  After review of the series by the NSSC staff it was sugested this soil is a Gypsid.  It borders to a Calcigypsid, however, the calcium content decreases with depth and is considered as non-pedogenic accumulations.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy 10th Ed. 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
