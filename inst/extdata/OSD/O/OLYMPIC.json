  "OVERVIEW": "The Olympic series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basic igneous rocks.  Olympic soils are on stable summits of foothills and mountains and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 60 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

Olympic soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days within the 3 months following the summer solstice.  The solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 100 inches.  Hue is 7.5 YR or 5YR throughout the solum.  The particle-size control section averages 15 to 25 percent sand coarser than very fine sand and 35 to 60 percent clay.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  The ratio of calcium to magnesium in the particle-size control section is 2 to 4.  Base saturation by sum of cations at 1.8 meters below the soil surface is less than 35 percent.\nThe A and AB horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 4 to 8 moist or dry.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Below the particle-size control section rock fragments range from none to about 75 percent and clay ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid to very strongly acid."

Base saturation (by sum of cations) is less than 35 percent to 1.8 meters in all pedons sampled.  This soil was previously classified as clayey, mixed, mesic Xeric Haplohumults.  Classification change based on National Soil Taxonomy Handbook, Issue No. 12, re-establishing Palehumults.\nAreas mapped Olympic in Cowlitz County, WA that were 40 to 60 inches to bedrock will be classified Xeric Haplohumults and need correlation to another series."
