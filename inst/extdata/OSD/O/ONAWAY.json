Slope gradients are commonly between 2 and 8 percent, but range from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 660 to 838 mm (26 to 33 inches).

Emmet, Kalkaska, Longrie, and Menominee soils are on similar landscape positions. Emmet soils are coarse-loamy. Kalkaska soils are somewhat excessively drained sandy soils. Longrie soils are underlain at depths less than 102 cm (40 inches) by limestone bedrock. Menominee soils have sandy surfaces. The somewhat poorly drained Mackinac soils and poorly drained Angelica soils are on lower landscape positions."
