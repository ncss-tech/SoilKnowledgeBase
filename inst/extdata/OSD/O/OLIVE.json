  "OVERVIEW": "The Olive series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils.  These soils formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of the Lissie Formation of Pleistocene age. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent but are mainly less than 0.5 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19.4 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm (51 in).",
