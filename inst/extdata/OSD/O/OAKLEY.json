    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Depth to a lithologic discontinuity of weathered Permian age redbed sediments ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Some pedons contain a few brown or gray redoximorphic depletions below 40 inches.  Most pedons have a perched water table below 48 inches during the winter and spring of years with above normal rainfall.  These soils are calcareous throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 3 to 25 percent by volume in the form of concretions, films, or masses.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 10 to 35 percent and a layer at least 6 inches thick contains 15 percent or more.  Some pedons contain a few masses of iron-manganese.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume and calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 3 to 15 percent.\nThe C horizon, where present, has color similar to the BC horizon.  Texture is variable and is commonly stratified with texture ranging from loamy sand to clay loam.  Some pedons have gravelly strata containing up to 30 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C or 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay and is weathered from Permian age redbed sediments."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Clark and Engle series in the same family and the similar Berda, Ruella, Quanah, Nuvalde, and Weymouth series.  Clark soils formed in brown eolian high plains sediments.  Engle soils are moderately deep to sandstone.  Berda, Ruella, and Weymouth soils have an ochric epipedon.  In addition, Berda soils are in a drier climate, Ruella soils are in a moister climate, and Weymouth soils are moderately deep to Permian age redbed sediments.  Quanah and Nuvalde soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section and are associated with soils formed from limestone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oakley soils formed in calcareous loamy alluvium over Permian age redbed sediments.  They occur on terraces along creeks and streams in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 78C & B) of southwestern Oklahoma and north Texas.  Slope gradients are typically 0 to 5 percent but range to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 28 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230 days.  Elevation ranges from 1000 to 2100 feet.  The Thornthwaite annual P-E Index ranges from 32 to 44."

In addition, Burford soils have an ochric epipedon, have a Cr horizon of Permian age redbed sediments within 60 inches, and occur on similar landscape positions.  Grandfield and Grandmore soils have an ochric epipedon, an argillic horizon, and occur on higher landscape positions.  Ozark soils have an argillic horizon and occur on slightly higher landscape positions.  Roark and Tipton soils have an argillic horizon, a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick, and occur on slightly higher broad nearly level areas.  Also, Roark soils have a fine particle size control section."
