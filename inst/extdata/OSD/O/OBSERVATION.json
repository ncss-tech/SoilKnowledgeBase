    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The moisture control section (10 to 21 inches) is dry from July 15 to November 1 (110 days).  It is moist from December 1 to May 15. The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from April 15 to December 1 (229 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F from May 15 to October 15.  Rock fragments, mostly cobbles and stones, cover 20 to 50 percent of the surface.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 18 inches thick and in some pedons extends into the upper part of the B horizon.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3 or 7.5YR 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2 or 6/4, 6/6.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/2, 4/4 or 4/6.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay and 5 to 25 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel and cobbles.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline."
