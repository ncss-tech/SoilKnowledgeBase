    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 22 to 35 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout.  Mudflow lenses or remnant discontinuous disoriented varves occur in individual horizons in some pedons.  Redox features in all layers between either the lower boundary of an Ap horizon or a depth of 10 inches below the mineral soil surface (whichever is deeper) and a depth of 16 inches.  Aquic conditions occur within 20 inches at some time in most years.  This soil reacts positively to alpha, alpha-dipryidyl at some time during saturation.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 or 3.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid or slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 5YR, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nOronto soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma 3 or 4.  It is typically silty clay loam or clay loam but in some pedons it is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, and value of 3 or 4.  It is typically silty clay loam or clay loam but, in some pedons, it is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, and value of 4 or 5.  It is typically silty clay loam or clay loam grading to silt loam in the lower part.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, and value of 4 or 5.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strong alkaline.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with color, texture and reaction like the BC horizon described above."

These soils formed in silty and loamy till derived from silty and loamy lacustrine deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 43 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 600 to 1200 feet."

The well drained Bohemian soils, the somewhat poorly drained Brimley soils, and the poorly drained Bruce soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the soil formed in stratified lacustrine deposits.  The well drained Denomie soils and the moderately well drained Gichigami soils form a drainage sequence with Oronto soils."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Some areas are used for cropland or pastureland.  Oats, bromegrass, timothy, reed canarygrass, and alfalfa are the principal crops.  Many areas which were formally cropland are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red maple, balsam fir, quaking aspen, paper birch, and willow.  Common understory species are speckled alder, redosier dogwood, black snakeroot, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern."
