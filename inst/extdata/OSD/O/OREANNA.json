    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry for over three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from about March 15 to about November 15.  The soil is dry from 8 to 21 inches from about June 15 to about November 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Depth to the 2C horizon is 20 to 30 inches.  Rock fragments in the upper part of the particle-size control section range from 5 to 30 percent, and in the lower part from 40 to 60 percent.  They are dominantly gravel.  Clay in the upper part of the particle-size control section ranges from 20 to 30 percent, and in the lower part averages from 0 to 10 percent.  The upper part is more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam, gravelly sandy clay loam, or clay loam."
