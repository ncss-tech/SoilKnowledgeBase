Coarse fragments in the control section average from 35 to 60 percent by weighted average.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  Reaction is extremely acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 through 6 moist, 3 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.  It is gravelly loam, cobbly loam or gravelly silt loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist or dry.

Cupples and Montborne soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact with dense glacial till.  Danforth and Larrupin soils are more than 40 inches deep.  Littlejohn soils have a mantle of volcanic ash.  Rinker and Winnecook soils are 35 to 70 percent phyllite, slate or shale in the particle-size control section."

These soils formed in glacial till and volcanic ash and alluvium from andesite.  Olomount soils have a cool marine climate with wet winters and dry summers.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 80 inches, the mean January temperature is 29 degrees F, and the mean July temperature is 59 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 160 days."
