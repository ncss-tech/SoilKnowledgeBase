  "OVERVIEW": "The Olomount series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in glacial till, volcanic ash, and colluvium from andesite.  Olomount soils are on mountain slopes and plateaus and have slopes of 3 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F.",
