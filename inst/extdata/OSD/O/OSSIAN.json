  "OVERVIEW": "The Ossian series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains, low stream terraces, upland drainageways, and lake basins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.",
