  "OVERVIEW": "The Ozona series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon.  These well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous loamy eolian sediments overlying marl and limestone of the Cretaceous-age Buda Limestone Formation.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on plain surfaces of the Edwards Plateau.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

Carbine soils have a petrocalcic horizon thicker than 20 inches and receive significant winter precipitation.  Espy soils are formed in loamy over gravelly igneous materials.  Kimbrough soils have a mollic epipedon to the indurated petrocalcic horizon.  Pitzer and Queeny soils are in more moist climates and have a gravelly substrata containing siliceous and limestone fragments.  Amistad, Boracho, Eola, Mailtrail, Noelke, and Zorra soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  Cho, Eola, and Mailtrail soils have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the particle-size control section.  Kavett and Mereta soils have a clayey particle-size control section."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 67 to 69 degrees F.  Frost-free season ranges from 220 to 260 days.

Kavett soils are on similar landscape positions.  Mailtrail soils are on footslope fan positions.  Noelke soils are on slightly higher positions.  Angelo soils are very deep and are in smooth valley fill positions.  Ector and Tarrant soils are underlain by limestone bedrock within 20 inches and are on rims above slope breaks.  Irion and Tobosa soils are in slight concave positions and have a clayey particle-size control section.  Texon soils are on similar landscapes and are very deep.  Noelke and Texon soils are mapped in a complex with Ozona soils in some areas."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Ozona series was established with a special survey of the Texas Range Station in Crockett County in 1938.  In 1974 the Ozona series was placed on the inactive list and combined with the Kavett and Mereta series.  The series was reactivated with the 1998 survey of Crockett County, Texas to define soils that are very similar to the original concept of the Ozona series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon--0 to 10 inches  (A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon--10 to 16 inches  (Bk horizon).\nPetrocalcic horizon--16 to 24 inches  (Bkm horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  TAMU Soil Characterization Laboratory data for the type location in Crockett County (S96TX-105-001).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Soil Taxonomy, 2nd edition, 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
