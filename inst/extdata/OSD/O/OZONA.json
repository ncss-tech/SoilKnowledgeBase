Total clay content ranges from about 28 to 40 percent, and silicate clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR. value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 5.  Fragments of caliche, from 1/4 to 3 inches across, range from few in the upper part to as much as 45 percent just above the petrocalcic horizon.\nThe Bkm horizon ranges from strongly cemented to indurated.  The upper 1 to 2 cm is laminar.\nThe Bk' horizon is weakly to moderately cemented with calcium carbonate and contains degrading caliche gravel and limestone gravel and cobbles."

Carbine soils have a petrocalcic horizon thicker than 20 inches and receive significant winter precipitation.  Espy soils are formed in loamy over gravelly igneous materials.  Kimbrough soils have a mollic epipedon to the indurated petrocalcic horizon.  Pitzer and Queeny soils are in more moist climates and have a gravelly substrata containing siliceous and limestone fragments.  Amistad, Boracho, Eola, Mailtrail, Noelke, and Zorra soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the particle-size control section.  Cho, Eola, and Mailtrail soils have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the particle-size control section.  Kavett and Mereta soils have a clayey particle-size control section."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ozona soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains of the Edwards Plateau.  Slopes are mainly less than 2 percent, but range to 3 percent.  The soil formed in calcareous loamy eolian sediments and sediments derived from marl and limestone of the Cretaceous age Buda Limestone Formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 67 to 69 degrees F.  Frost-free season ranges from 220 to 260 days.  Elevation ranges from 2,000 to 2,700 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 24 to 36."

Kavett soils are on similar landscape positions.  Mailtrail soils are on footslope fan positions.  Noelke soils are on slightly higher positions.  Angelo soils are very deep and are in smooth valley fill positions.  Ector and Tarrant soils are underlain by limestone bedrock within 20 inches and are on rims above slope breaks.  Irion and Tobosa soils are in slight concave positions and have a clayey particle-size control section.  Texon soils are on similar landscapes and are very deep.  Noelke and Texon soils are mapped in a complex with Ozona soils in some areas."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Ozona series was established with a special survey of the Texas Range Station in Crockett County in 1938.  In 1974 the Ozona series was placed on the inactive list and combined with the Kavett and Mereta series.  The series was reactivated with the 1998 survey of Crockett County, Texas to define soils that are very similar to the original concept of the Ozona series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon--0 to 10 inches  (A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon--10 to 16 inches  (Bk horizon).\nPetrocalcic horizon--16 to 24 inches  (Bkm horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  TAMU Soil Characterization Laboratory data for the type location in Crockett County (S96TX-105-001).\nTAXONOMIC VERSION:  Soil Taxonomy, 2nd edition, 1999.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
