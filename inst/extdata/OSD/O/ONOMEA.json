  "STATES": "HI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Onomea series consists of deep and very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic matter and volcanic ash over basaltic lava.  Onomea soils are in bogs on mid elevation, northeast, windward slopes of Mauna Kea Volcano. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5840 millimeters (230 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
