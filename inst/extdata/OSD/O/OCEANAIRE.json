  "OVERVIEW": "The Oceanaire series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from calcareous shale or limestone.  The Oceanaire soils are on side slopes of hills and low mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 55 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 356 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.",
