  "OVERVIEW": "The Olnest series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on hills, ridges, uplands and plains.  They formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from the Ogallala Formation.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 inches, and mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",
