  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 40 inches in thickness and includes all or part of the Bw horizon.  The 10- to 40-inch control section typically is silty clay loam and some is silt loam or clay loam.  It averages between 27 and 35 percent clay.  Some pedons are saline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It typically is silty clay loam, but some is silt loam, clay loam, loam, or silty clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It has weak or moderate grades of prismatic, subangular or angular blocky structure.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to over 30 percent.  Carbonates are disseminated or in few to many, and small to large masses.  Some pedons have BC or BCk horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many and faint to prominent, but they may be absent in some well drained pedons.  The C horizon is laminated and commonly has textures including silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam or silty clay.  Below depths of 40 inches in some pedons are strata of sand or clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Overly soils are on level to gently sloping glacial lake plains and terraces on valley side slopes.  Slope commonly is less than 2 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in calcareous lacustrine sediments.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches. Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer.  Frost-free period ranges from 105 to 140 days.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 650 to 2350 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Beotia soils and Bearden, Colvin, Fargo, Gardena, Glyndon, Great Bend, Hegne, Perella and Walsh soils. The competing Beotia soils occur on similar or slightly higher elevations than Overly soils. Bearden, Colvin, Great Bend and Perella soils are in a drainage sequence with Overly soils. Great Bend soils are well drained soils on higher elevations. Bearden soils are on smoother, slightly lower elevations. Colvin and Perella soils are in low concave swales and shallow basins. Both soils are poorly drained. In addition, Bearden and Colvin soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches. Gardena, Glyndon and Walsh soils are on nearby deltas and lake plains. Gardena and Glyndon soils have coarse-silty textures. In addition, Glyndon soils have calcic horizons within depths of 16 inches. Walsh soils have fine-loamy textures with significant amounts of shale. Fargo and Hegne soils are on nearby lake plains where sediments contain more clay. Both soils have fine textures."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and moderately high or moderately low in the substratum below a depth of 40 inches. A seasonal high water table is at a depth of 3 to 5 feet at some time during the period of April through June in the moderately well drained phase. It is at a depth of 4 to more than 6 feet for the same period in the well-drained phase."
