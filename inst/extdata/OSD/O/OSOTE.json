These soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 42 to 47 degrees F., and a mean summer soil temperature of 59 to 64 degrees.  The organic matter content decreases irregularly with increasing depth or remains higher than 0.5 percent at depths of 50 inches.  The control section averages from 25 to 35 percent clay with more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bw and Bk horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The 2Bk horizon, where present, is very gravelly or very cobbly loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is stratified loam, very gravelly loam, extremely cobbly loam, or very gravelly sandy loam."

Ahlstrom soils lack mollic epipedons and have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Duffy, Prospect and Quigley soils have a regular decrease in organic matter that reaches levels of less than 0.5 percent within a depth of 50 inches.  Shupert soils lack mollic epipedons and cambic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients range from 1 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from limestone and sandstone.  The average annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 70 to 80 days.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and the average summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F."
