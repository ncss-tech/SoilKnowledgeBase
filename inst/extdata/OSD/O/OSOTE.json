  "OVERVIEW": "The Osote series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on alluvial fans, cones, and toeslopes.  They formed in colluvium and alluvium from limestone and sandstone.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",
