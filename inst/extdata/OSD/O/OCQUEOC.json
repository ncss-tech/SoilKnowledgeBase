  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from about 15 to 30 inches, and the depth to the 2C horizon is less than 40 inches.  Rock content ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the solum. The solum is predominantly fine sand or sand, but includes loamy sand or loamy fine sand.  The solum ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid, and the 2C horizon ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a thin A horizon with hue of 10YR to 5YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 to 3.  Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon with the same colors as for the A horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have Bhs horizons, 1 to 3 inches thick, which are discontinuous and often in small pockets, or in old root channels.  They are present in 50 percent or less of the pedon.  They have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, and value and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Some pedons have a BC horizon with colors and textures similar to the Bs horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture includes very fine sand, loamy very fine sand, silt, and silt loam, with occasional strata of fine sand, loamy fine sand, sand, very fine sandy loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series.  Closely related soils include the Croswell, Deerton, Duel, Eastport, Gilchrist, Kalkaska, Karlin, Melita, Menominee, Rousseau, Rubicon, Vilas, and Yalmer series. None of these soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size class except the Menominee soils.  Croswell, Eastport, Kalkaska, Rousseau, Rubicon, and Vilas soils do not have loamy 2C horizons within depths of 40 inches.  In addition, Kalkaska, Rubicon, and Vilas soils have formed primarily in medium sand.  Melita, Menominee, and Yalmer soils are underlain by finer textured glacial till and have argillic horizons. Deerton soils are underlain by sandstone bedrock within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Duel soils are underlain by limestone bedrock within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Karlin soils have loamy fine sand sola overlying sand within the control section.  Kiva soils have thin loamy sola overlying sand and gravel."

They formed in sandy outwash and stratified lacustrine sediments of late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 34 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F."
