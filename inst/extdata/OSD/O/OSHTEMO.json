  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brownsburg, Crumstown, Eleva, Hillsdale, and Mecan series. Brownsburg soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 in). Crumstown and Hillsdale soils are not clearly differentiated from the Oshtemo soils because of overlapping properties within the series control section and because the C horizons in these soils are not always present within the series control section. Where present within the series control section, the Hillsdale soils have C horizons composed of sandy loam or fine sandy loam till.  The Crumstown soils also have an apparent high water table ranging from 107 to 183 cm (3.5 to 6 feet) in normal years.   In addition, the Oshtemo series allows for a loamy substratum phase that has a high water table within 152 cm (60 in). Eleva soils have a paralithic or lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 in). Mecan soils have more clay and silt and are not stratified in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oshtemo soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, moraines, and beach ridges. Slope ranges from 0 to 55 percent. Oshtemo soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy deposits that have a high content of quartz and contain variable amounts of material derived from igneous and metamorphic rocks, sandstone, limestone, and dolomite. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1040 mm (28 to 41 in). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 11.1 degrees C (47 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 120 to 230 days. Elevation is 165 to 315 m (540 to 1,033 ft) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Brady soils, the moderately well drained Bronson soils, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford soils are in a drainage sequence with the Oshtemo soils. Boyer, Spinks, and Kalamazoo soils are associated on outwash plains and valley trains. Spinks and Hillsdale soils are closely associated with Oshtemo soils on moraines. Spinks soils have argillic horizons composed of lamellae and Kalamazoo soils contain from 18 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon."
