  "OVERVIEW": "The Ospital series consists of very shallow, moderately well drained soils formed in localized alluvium and/or residuum derived from acidic tuff. The Ospital soils are in swales on erosion remnants with mound and swale microrelief. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 17 degrees C.",

Pentz has a mollic epipedon. Pardee soils are found on terrace remnants and eroded fan remnants and are loamy-skeletal. Redding soils are on fan remnants and have a duripan within 50 to 100 centimeters. Laniger soils are on hills, have andic soil properties, and a lithic contact within 50 to 100 centimeters. Miltonhills soils form on the backslopes of hills, have an umbric epipedon, and a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 cm."
