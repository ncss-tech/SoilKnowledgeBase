    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ospital soils are in swales on erosion remnants with mound and swale microrelief. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in localized alluvium and/or residuum derived from acidic tuff mainly associated with the Valley Springs Formation. Elevation is 60 to 650 meters. The climate is Mediterranean with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 915 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 15 to 17 degrees C. The frost free season is 235 to 340 days."

Pentz has a mollic epipedon. Pardee soils are found on terrace remnants and eroded fan remnants and are loamy-skeletal. Redding soils are on fan remnants and have a duripan within 50 to 100 centimeters. Laniger soils are on hills, have andic soil properties, and a lithic contact within 50 to 100 centimeters. Miltonhills soils form on the backslopes of hills, have an umbric epipedon, and a paralithic contact between 50 and 100 cm."
