Diaz soils have transitional BAt horizons in the upper part of the argillic horizon and are effervescent in the argillic horizon.  Glasgow soils have A horizons formed in a mantle of loess high in volcanic ash and have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Risley soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Trunk soils have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

These soils formed in residuum derived from andesite and other basic volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,980 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

Surgem soils are clayey-skeletal and are underlain by granodiorite.  Wedekind soils have 25 to 50 cm thick sandy clay loam argillic horizons.  Yuko soils have silty clay loam argillic horizons."
