  "OVERVIEW": "The Okemah series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in material weathered from loamy and clayey alluvium or colluvium from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  Okemah soils are on broad smooth high terraces or on the lower slopes of uplands in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 1041 mm (41 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (61 degrees F).",
