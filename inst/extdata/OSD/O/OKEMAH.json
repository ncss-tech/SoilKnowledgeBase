Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  The soils formed in loamy and clayey alluvium or colluvium, or from shale of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1168 mm (37 to 46 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 18 degrees C (57 to 64 degrees F).  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 64 to 80."

Bates soils are fine-loamy and have sandstone at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Collinsville soils are loamy and have sandstone within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches).  Parsons and Taloka soils are on the same landscape in slightly lower positions.  Parsons and Taloka soils have an ochric epipedon and an abrupt change in texture from the A horizon to the Bt horizon."
