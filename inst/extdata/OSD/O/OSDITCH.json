    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Osditch soils are on mountains. They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium derived from quartzite and argillite. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,250 to 3,350 meters. The climate is moist-subhumid, with cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The revision of March 2008 changed the temperature regime to cryic. The revision of December 2002, adjusted horizon depths for the Oi horizon as the soil surface and verified the presence of both albic and cambic horizons. A prior revision in March 2001 updated the taxonomic classification from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, nonacid, frigid Typic Xerorthents.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (Oi, A, and part of the E1 horizons).\nAlbic horizon - The zone from 8 to 46 cm (E1 and E2 horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 8 to 152 cm (E1, E2, E and Bt1, and the E and Bt2 horizons).\nLamellae - The zone from 46 to 152 cm (E and Bt1 and the E and Bt2 horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm measured from the mineral soil surface at the top of the A horizon (part of the E2, E and Bt1 horizon and part of the E and Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
