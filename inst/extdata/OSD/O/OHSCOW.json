These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 8 and 24 inches for 45 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper 7 to 14 inches consists of partially weathered volcanic ash with an estimated bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 70 percent rock fragments. The solum is 24 to 36 inches thick.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.

Belzar, Hartill, Kloochman, Oxerine, Redriver, and Wilma soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Newhorn soils have compact till at 20 to 40 inches.  Oxerine soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  McCree soils are medial-skeletal in the upper part of the particle-size control section, loamy-skeletal in the lower part and average as loamy-skeletal. Newbell soils have sola 10 to 20 inches thick and the B horizon is 5 to 15 percent rock fragments and 8 to 12 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Talls soils have distinct clay bands in the 2A and 2B horizons and are 18 to 25 percent clay in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Threemile soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the control section.  Wilmont soils are dominated by channery rock fragments and are very channery or extremely channery in the particle-size control section."
