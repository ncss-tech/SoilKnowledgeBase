  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 31 to 45 inches thick.  Depth to strongly calcareous material is 45 to 65 inches. The surface 30 to 40 inches are noncalcareous and the 30 to 65 inch depths are noncalcareous to moderately calcareous. The average annual soil temperature is 44 degrees to 46 degrees F., and the average temperature at about 20 inches depth is 65 degrees to 68 degrees F. The C.E.C./clay ratio is 0.7 to 0.95. Cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide extending to depths of 40 inches or more occur when the soils are dry. The cracks open and close once each year and remain open for 60 consecutive days or more in 7 out of 10 years. In the uncultivated areas, gilgai micro-relief is evident.\nThe Al horizon has hue of lOYR to 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak to strong medium subangular blocky structure that parts to weak fine or medium granules in the upper portion and moderate to strong prismatic structure that parts to moderate medium and fine subangular blocks in the lower part.  It is slightly to medium acid. It has common to many slickensides.\nThe C horizon has hue of lOYR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, and 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 throgh 4. It is usually silty clay or clay, ranging to heavy silty clay loam or heavy clay loam. It has weak to moderate prismatic structure or is massive.  It is medium acid to mildly alkaline and noncalcareous to strongly calcareous."

Ager, Aikman, Cardon, Hiibner, Nebeker and Springerville soils have mean annual temperature warmer than 47 degrees F. Also, Cardon soils have chroma of less than l.5 throughout the upper 12 inches, Hiibner soils have very strong clay argillic horizons, and Nebeker soils have argillic horizons. Ant Flat and Goring soils have argillic horizons."

In uncultivated areas, gilgai micro-relief is evident. The climate is moist subhumid with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters. The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches, the mean annual temperature is 42 degrees to 45 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 62 degrees to 65 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 60 to 110 days."
