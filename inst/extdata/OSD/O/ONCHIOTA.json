  "OVERVIEW": "The Onchiota series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in sandy deposits on lake plains and outwash plains. Saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately low to moderately high in the ortstein layer, and high to very high throughout the remainder of the pedon. Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 millimeters and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The well drained Wolf Pond (T) soils are on slightly higher landform positions. The somewhat poorly drained Kushaqua (T) and very poorly drained Searsport soils are in lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with the Onchiota (T) soils. Adams and Colton soils do not contain more than 50 percent ortstein and are on higher landscape positions. The organic Burnt Vly soils are in adjacent depressions and drainageways. The Monadnock soils formed in till and have less than 60 percent ortstein in any layer."
