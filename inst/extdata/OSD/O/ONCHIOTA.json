Depth to the ortstein material ranges from 12 through 50 centimeters from the mineral surface. Redoximorphic features occur within a depth of 90 centimeters.\nThe O horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It consists of slightly through highly decomposed plant material. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have A horizons up to 8 centimeters thick with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction of the A horizon ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nSome pedons occur in areas of current or previous cultivation and contain an Ap horizon up to 20 cm thick with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction of the Ap horizon ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid. The E horizon may be absent in areas previously cultivated or heavily pastured.\nSome pedons have a very friable or friable Bh horizon with hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a Bs horizon that may be above or below the cemented horizons. It has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe Bhs or Bhsm horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.

Wolf Pond (T) soils lack redoximorphic features above 100 centimeters deep.\nIn closely related families is the Wallace, Voelker, and Borgstrom series. The Wallace, Voelker and Borgstrom soils have a lower mean annual precipitation. Wallace soils lack redoximorphic features above 100 centimeters."

The well drained Wolf Pond (T) soils are on slightly higher landform positions. The somewhat poorly drained Kushaqua (T) and very poorly drained Searsport soils are in lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with the Onchiota (T) soils. Adams and Colton soils do not contain more than 50 percent ortstein and are on higher landscape positions. The organic Burnt Vly soils are in adjacent depressions and drainageways. The Monadnock soils formed in till and have less than 60 percent ortstein in any layer."
