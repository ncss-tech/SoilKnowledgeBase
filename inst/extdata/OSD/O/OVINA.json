  "OVERVIEW": "The Ovina series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy eolian and alluvial material on flood plains and terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 56 centimeters (22 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F).",
