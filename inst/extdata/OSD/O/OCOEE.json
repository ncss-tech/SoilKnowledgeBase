Reaction of the organic material ranges from extremely acid to very strongly acid; however, it is less than 4.4 in 0.01M calcium chloride in at least some part of the organic material.  Reaction of the underlying material ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2.  Fiber content ranges from 20 to 90 percent unrubbed and less than 30 percent after rubbing.\nThe Oe horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4, or it is neutral with value of 2 t 4.  Fiber content ranges from 50 to 90 percent unrubbed and less than 40 percent rubbed.  Sodium pyrophosphate extract has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.\nThe 2 Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or it is neutral with value of 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid."
