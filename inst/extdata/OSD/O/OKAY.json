  "OVERVIEW": "The Okay series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in material weathered from loamy alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on broad, smooth high terraces in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112). Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",
