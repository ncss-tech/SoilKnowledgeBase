  "OVERVIEW": "The Obispo series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from serpentinite rock. Obispo soils are on uplands and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 58 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 8 to 20 inches.  The soil below the depth of about 4 inches is usually moist between sometime in November and sometime in May and usually dry the rest of the year. The mean annual soil temperature is about 61 degrees to 65 degrees F.\nThe A horizon is gray, grayish brown, dark gray, dark grayish brown, very dark gray or very dark grayish brown (10YR 5/1, 5/2, 4/1, 4/2, 3/1, 3/2). Moist colors are very dark gray, very dark grayish brown, black or very dark brown (10YR 3/1, 3/2, 2/1, 2/2.) This horizon is usually clay but is clay loam with more than 35 percent clay in some pedons. It contains up to 35 percent by volume serpentinite pebbles and cobbles. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline. The calcium to magnesium ratio is assumed to be low."

Climara soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 28 to 40 inches, have cracks that extend to a depth of 20 inches or more and have intersecting slickensides. Delpiedra and Dubakella soils have an argillic horizon. Hambright, Lopez, Permanente and Plaskett soil shave more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Also, Permanente and Plaskett soils have a soil temperature less than 59 degrees F. Henneke soils have an argillic horizon and have 35 to 50 percent rock fragments. Montara soils have less than 35 percent clay."

They formed in residual material weathered from serpentinite at elevations of 200 to 2,500 feet. The climate is dry, subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. the mean annual precipitation is 16 to 35 inches. The average January temperature is 52 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 63 degrees F.; the average annual temperature is 56 to 60 degrees F. The frost-free season is 275 to 350 days."

Also, Cibo, Clear Lake, Cropley and Diablo soils have cracks that extend below 20 inches and have slickensides; Gazos soils have 20 to 30 percent clay in the control section and Los Osos soils have an argillic horizon.
