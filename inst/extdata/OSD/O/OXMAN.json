Depth to consolidated lacustrine sediments and solum thickness is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section has an average of 18 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 25 coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bk horizon has moist value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4 moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bk horizons have value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam with 15 to 27 percent clay.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Percent of soft lacustrine fragments is 0 to 25 in the lower part."
