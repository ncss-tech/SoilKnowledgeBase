  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches in thickness.  Depth to calcium carbonates is quite variable within short horizontal distances and ranges from 18 to 50 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch particle size control section ranges from 18 to 30 percent clay and 30 to 60 percent sand.  Rock fragments, of mixed lithology, range from 2 to 10 percent by volume of the profile.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is typically loam but includes clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is typically loam, sandy loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Secondary calcium carbonates are common to many in the form of threads and masses.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4.   The moderately coarse substratum phase has textures of loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It has 12 to 22 percent clay and more than 40 percent total sand.  The moderately fine substratum phase has textures of loam or clay loam.  It has 20 to 30 percent clay and less than 45 percent total sand.  Reaction is slighlty alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Redox features are considered as relic as they do not relate to present day soil saturation."

Arbor, Cresken, Kenyon and Liscomb soils have firm glacial till with a bulk density of more than 1.60 g/cc in the lower on third of the series control section.   Aredale, Everly, Moland, Ocheyedan and Ostrander soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the control section and have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the upper one fourth of the series control section.  Bode soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the series control section and have less than 30 percent sand in the upper one fourth of the series control section.  Clarion soils have saturation with water in the lower third of the series control section.  Farrar soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the control section and have less than 18 percent clay in the upper one third of the series control section. Frontenac soils have 35 to 75 percent rock fragments in the lower third of the series control section.  Garmore soils have free carbonates at depths of more than 50 inches.  Limecreek and Rossfield soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Neeper soils do not have free carbonates in the control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Omsrud soils have convex or linear slopes on ground moraines.  Slopes gradients range from 5 to 40 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous loamy glacial till of late Wisconsin age.  Mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 30 inches.  Frost free days range from 125 to 165.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1600."

The poorly drained Canisteo and somewhat poorly drained Crippin soils are calcareous and are lower on the landscape.  The well drained Clarion soils are on nearly level summits, sideslopes or convex rises.  The somewhat poorly drained Nicollet and poorly drained Webster soils are lower on the landscape.  The very poorly drained Okoboji soils are in closed depressions.  The well drained Storden and Swanlake soils are on higher lying convex knolls and shoulder slopes."
