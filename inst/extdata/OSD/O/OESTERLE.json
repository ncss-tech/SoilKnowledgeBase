  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle, depth to the base of the argillic horizon, and depth to sandy outwash all range from 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section averages 7 to 17 percent clay and 50 percent or more, fine sand or coarser.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle but is typically less than 15 percent.  The volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 3 to 50 percent as a weighted average, and from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.  Redox features are throughout the solum below the Ap horizon.  Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and aquic conditions are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture of the Ap or A horizon is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture typically is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs. Less typically, it is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand or the gravelly analogs.\nOesterle soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.  Below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon, some pedons have a Btg horizon with dominant chroma of 2 or less.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt or 2BC horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8.  Texture is sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has color like the 2BC horizon described above.  It is typically stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.  Some pedons have strata of loamy sand or loamy coarse sand or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs."

Brennyville, Mora, and Stinnett soils have a densic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Fallcreek, Hatley, Magnor,  Plover, and Rosy soils average less than 85 percent sand  in the lower part of the series control section.  Glendenning soils have a densic contact at a depth of 60 to 80 inches and have less than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Magroc soils have a lithic contact with igneous or metamorphic bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Maincreek soils have a densic contact at a depth of 20 to 36 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oesterle soils are on outwash plains, valley trains, stream terraces, glacial lake plains, and in outwash areas on moraines.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in loamy alluvium overlying sandy outwash.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 135 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1950 feet."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to low.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy alluvium and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Flooding is none to rare.  These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet for 1 month or more per year at some time during the period October to June in 6 or more out of 10 years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Many areas are used for cropland or pastureland.  Corn, small grain, and hay are the principal crops.  Many areas are used for woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Eastern white pine, red maple, bigtooth aspen, paper birch, northern red oak, American hornbeam, white spruce, eastern hemlock, sugar maple, yellow birch, American elm, white ash, balsam fir, and quaking aspen are the major tree species."
