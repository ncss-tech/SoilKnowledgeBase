  "OVERVIEW": "The Odo series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from basalt with an influence of loess and minor amounts of  volcanic ash in the surface. Odo soils are on hillsides and canyonsides. Slopes are 0 to 40 [SW1]percent. The mean annual precipitation is about l6 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
