The reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid in all horizons except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.\nThe E portion of the E and Bh horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The Bh portion has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is discontinuous and ranges from 15 to 75 percent of the E/Bh horizon.  Weakly to strongly cemented Bh concretions range from 15 to 35 percent of the Bh portion of this horizon.  In some pedons the Bh horizon is destroyed by tillage but the Bh concretions remain in the plow layer as evidence of this horizon.\nThe E' horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A, E,  and E/Bh horizons are loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, and sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or rarely 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8 or is mottled in shades of these colors.  Mottles in shades of gray, brown, and red are in most pedons with a dominant matrix color.\nThe Btg and BCg horizons have hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 2.  Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, and red are in most pedons.  The Bt, Btg, and BCg horizons are sandy clay loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam, and sandy loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Mottles in shades of yellow and brown are in some pedons.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, and sand or is stratified with these textures.  Some pedons have clayey or silty IIC horizons."
