  "STATES": "UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ojavan series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone.  Ojavan soils are on escarpments and structural benches.  Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches (381mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F (8.9 degrees C).",
