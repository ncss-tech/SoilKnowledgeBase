  "OVERVIEW": "The Omega series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in sandy glacial outwash on outwash plains or valley trains.  These soils have rapid permeability.  Their slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates is greater than 80 inches.  The solum and C horizon typically do not have rock fragments, but gravel ranging from 2 to 5mm in diameter comprise as much as 10 percent of the solum and C horizon in some pedons.  Mineralogy of the sand fraction is mixed, but dark colored minerals comprise 40 to 60 percent or more of that fraction. The average texture in the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section is sand or fine sand.  Horizons with texture of sand or fine sand both with more than 10 percent silt and clay or with texture of loamy sand or loamy fine sand extend to depths of 10 to 30 inches.  The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe Oe and Oa horizons are comprised of partially or well decomposed organic litter of needles, leaves and flora remains.  They have hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, or are neutral with value of 2 and chroma of 0.\nSome pedons have an A horizon as much as 3 inches thick.  It has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon is discontinuous within the limits of some pedons, but it is present in some parts of all pedons.  It has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is at least one unit higher in value than the B horizon immediately below it.  Moist chroma of 3 is allowed if value dry is 7 or more.\nThe A and E horizons are loamy sand or loamy fine sand and are very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has 2.5YR or 5YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, fine sand, or sand. It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  Sand grains have cracked coatings of iron and aluminum sesquioxides.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture, reaction, and coatings are like the Bhs horizon above.\nWhen present, the Bw or BC horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 5.  Sand grains do not have cracked coatings.  It is sand or fine sand.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe C horizon has 2.5YR or 5YR hue, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 5.  It is sand or fine sand.  It is moderately acid to neutral."

Furlong soils have a lithic contact within 60 inches.  Kalkaska and Springlake soils have hue of 7.5YR or yellower below 30 inches or the lower one-half of the series control section.  Liminga soils have 5 percent or more cemented material (ortstein) in the series control section."

They formed in thick sandy outwash sediments.  These sediments are derived from the Superior or Rainy lobes of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 120.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 1600 feet."

They are on lower lying terrain. Also, organic soils such as Dawson, Loxley, and Greenwood are associated in some places."

Note:  the Soil Taxonomy Amendment Number 14 changed the criteria of spodic material.  This soil now has a Bs or Bhs which meets the definition of spodic materials.)"
