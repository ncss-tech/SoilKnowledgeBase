  "OVERVIEW": "The Ovidcreek series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvium on lake and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Permeability is slow. Average annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Bear Lake soils are in poorly drained depressional to flat positions. Lago soils are on slightly convex to smooth areas on low terraces and are in complex with Bear Lake soils. Thatcherflats soils occur on terraces on positions slightly lower than Ovidcreek soils."
