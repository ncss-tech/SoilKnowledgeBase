Bear Lake soils have an aquic moisture regime. Lago soils have water tables at 18 to 36 inches. Thatcherflats soils lack a mollic epipedon and are somewhat poorly drained. Bear Lake soils are in poorly drained depressional to flat positions. Lago soils are on slightly convex to smooth areas on low terraces and are in complex with Bear Lake soils. Thatcherflats soils occur on terraces on positions slightly lower than Ovidcreek soils."
