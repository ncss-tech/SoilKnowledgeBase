  "OVERVIEW": "The Odenson series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in glaciolacustrine sediments and a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. These soils are on low positions of terraces and adjacent to terrace drainageways and have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 33 inches and average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
