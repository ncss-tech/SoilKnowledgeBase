  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series was formerly included in the Mustang series. The series was separated based on differences in water table depth, salinity, and vegetation.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 25 to 100 cm (10 to 40 in)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in) (Ag horizon)\nEndosaturation and aquic conditions: 0 to 203 cm (0 to 80 in) (Ag, Cg1, Cg2,2Cg1 and 2Cg2 horizons)\nLithologic discontinuity: 115 to 203 cm (45 to 80 in).\nAdditional Comments: The lithologic discontinuity is evident as an increase in clay due to the Beaumont Formation and ancient Brazos River. This paleo-surface is deeper in pedons on Galveston Island and shallower on the southwest end of Follets Island. Some areas are firm enough during low tide to allow light vehicular traffic.\nADDITIONAL DATA: MLRA Soil Survey Office data are available on S2020TX0397171 at the series type location.\nTAXONOMIC VERSION: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
