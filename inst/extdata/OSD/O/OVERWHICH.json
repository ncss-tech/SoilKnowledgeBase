  "OVERVIEW": "The Overwhich series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium or outwash. These soils are on stream terraces, outwash fans, and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm. Mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
