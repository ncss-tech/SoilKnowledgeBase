    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification changed from Typic Ochraqualfs to Aquic Haplustalfs 11/2000 based on typifying pedon description.  The series type location was moved and series concept revised after study and transects during the update of MLRA 150A in 2007.  Randomly placed transects and pedon descriptions indicated that theses soils are predominantly mollisols and not alfisols.  Also, in the past, these soils were considered to have a hard and massive surface which caused this soil to fail the mollic epipedon requirement.  Laboratory data confirmed these soils have a mollic epipedon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 26 to 76 cm (10 to 30 in). (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 39 cm (0 to 15 in). (A and Bt1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 26 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btk1, Btk2, Btk3, and Btk4 horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data on pedon number S05TX-355-001 from an Orelia sample taken from Nueces County, Texas.  Additional laboratory data available from sample S06TX-025-001 in Bee County.\nTaxonomic Version:  Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
