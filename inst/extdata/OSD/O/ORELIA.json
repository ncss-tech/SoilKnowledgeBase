  "OVERVIEW": "The Orelia series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are on flats on coast plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 21 degrees C (71 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in).",

The series type location was moved and series concept revised after study and transects during the update of MLRA 150A in 2007.  Randomly placed transects and pedon descriptions indicated that theses soils are predominantly mollisols and not alfisols.  Also, in the past, these soils were considered to have a hard and massive surface which caused this soil to fail the mollic epipedon requirement.  Laboratory data confirmed these soils have a mollic epipedon.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section: 26 to 76 cm (10 to 30 in). (Bt1, Bt2, and Bt3 horizons)\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 39 cm (0 to 15 in). (A and Bt1 horizons)\nArgillic horizon: 26 to 203 cm (10 to 80 in). (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btk1, Btk2, Btk3, and Btk4 horizons)"
