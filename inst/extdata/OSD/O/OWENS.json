  "OVERVIEW": "The Owens series consists of shallow to moderately deep over claystone bedrock  or dense clay well drained, very slowly Permeable soils that formed in residuum from claystone bedrock. These soils are on gently sloping to steep escarpments and plains. Slopes range from 1 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 18.3 degrees C (65 degrees F).",
