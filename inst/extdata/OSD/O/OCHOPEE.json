    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ochopee series occur primarily on low lying prairies in southern Hendry county and central and eastern Collier County.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 72 degrees F.  Mean annual rainfall is about 55 inches."

    "content": "SERIES ESTABLISHED:  Hendry County, Florida; 1986.  The proposed series name has not been used in any soil survey that meets the standards of the NCSS.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The mineralogy of this soil is mixed due to 20 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  However, the sand mineralogy is siliceous.  The carbonates are due to recharge from a fluctuating ground water table.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 6 inches - the A horizon\nCalcic horizon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 10 inches - the A and Bk horizons\nLithic contact - at a depth of 10 inches - the surface of hard limestone\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
