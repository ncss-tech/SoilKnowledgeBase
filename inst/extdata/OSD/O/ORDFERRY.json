Slickensides range from few to common in the Bss and Bss horizons.  A fluctuating water table can occur from the top of the duripan to 6 inches, (15 cm) below the surface of the soil from December through May.  Redoximorphic features such as manganese nodules, manganese masses and oxidized iron masses may occur throughout all horizons.  Some pedons have accumulations of carbonates and or carbonate concretions in chimney areas.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/2.  Texture is silty clay or clay.
