The 2C horizon contains 25 to 60 percent gravel.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The solum can contain up to l5 percent pebbles by volume.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or sandy loam and is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It contains common or many, fine or medium accumulation of carbonate.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 7 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very gravelly sand, very gravelly loamy sand or gravelly sand and is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Akaska soils are fine-silty in the solum. Durrstein soils are on adjacent bottom lands and have a natric horizon.  Ree soils are on similar landscapes and terraces, have an argillic horizon and do not have sand and gravel above 40 inches.  Talmo soils are on crests and knolls of ridges and on terrace scarps and have sand and gravel within 14 inches of the surface."
