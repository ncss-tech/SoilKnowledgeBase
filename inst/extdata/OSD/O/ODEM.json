  "OVERVIEW": "The Odem series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvial sediments of Holocene age. These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on natural levees along streams and rivers. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 895 mm (35 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
