Depth to a lithic contact with basalt is 40 to more than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak granular, subangular blocky or prismatic structure.  This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It has weak or moderate structure.  This horizon is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nA Bk horizon is present in some pedons having color value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and a chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  It is silt loam, or loam and is gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly or very cobbly."

Oliphant soils formed in loess over slope alluvium and colluvium from basalt and loess over lacustrine sediment.  Summers are warm and dry, winters are cool and moist.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The average July temperature is 68 to 73 degrees F.  The average January temperature is 22 to 32 degrees F.  The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 180 days."

Chard soils are coarse-loamy. Spofford and Weissenfels soils have a natric horizon.  Walla Walla soils lack a Bk horizon within 44 inches."
