  "OVERVIEW": "The Oliphant series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in loess over slope alluvium and colluvium from basalt and loess over lacustrine sediment.  Oliphant soils are on plateaus, hillslopes terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 55 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 14 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Depth to a lithic contact with basalt is 40 to more than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak granular, subangular blocky or prismatic structure.  This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It has weak or moderate structure.  This horizon is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nA Bk horizon is present in some pedons having color value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and a chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  It is silt loam, or loam and is gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly or very cobbly."
