  "OVERVIEW": "The Ohke series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granite, gneiss, and schist.  Ohke soils are on low stream terraces of valley floors.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
