Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Elevation ranges from 6,100 to 7,700 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 15 inches, with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Altazano soils are coarse-loamy, do not have ochric epipedons, and occur on adjacent flood plains of valley floors and also on inset fans of erosional fan remnants.  Buckhorse soils are coarse-loamy, have argillic horizons, and occur on toeslopes of erosional fan remnants.  Dondiego soils are fine-loamy, have thick mollic epipedons, and occur on adjacent lower portions of low stream terraces."
