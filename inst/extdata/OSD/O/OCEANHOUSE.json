    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oceanhouse soils are on concave backslope positions on mountain slopes dominated by earthflows. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. Elevations are 10 to 750 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from strongly cemented sandstone, mudstone, and metasedimentary rock. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1270 to 2030 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days."

Forhaux soils have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section and are on convex summit and shoulder positions. Peaked soils have redoximorphic features between 50 and 100 centimeters and are on linear to slightly concave or convex summit, shoulder, and backslope positions."
