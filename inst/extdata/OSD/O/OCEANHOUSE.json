  "OVERVIEW": "The Oceanhouse series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone, mudstone, and metasedimentary rock. Oceanhouse soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1525 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
