  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to the indurated duripan range from 10 to 20 inches. Olson soils are usually dry during most years, mainly during the summer and early autumn, but are moist more than 1/4 of the time the soil temperature is more than 41 F. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 45 to 47 F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 to 65 F. The solum ranges in pH from 6.5 to 7.0.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak or moderate, thin or medium platy structure, or is massive. Transitional A3 or Bt horizons are in most pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4. It is commonly sandy clay loam, but is clay loam or loam in some pedons. Gravel content ranges up to 35 percent. The B2t horizon has weak fine or medium prismatic, weak or moderate very fine to medium subangular blocky structure, or is massive.\nThe duripan has value of 6, 7 or 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2, 3 or 4. Coatings in some pedons have chroma of 1 through 6. The duripan ranges from 6 to 26 inches thick, but the indurated part ranges from 2 to 9 inches thick. The upper part of the duripan is normally noncalcareous but ranges to slightly calcareous. pH values range from 7.0 where noncalcareous, to 8.8 where calcareous. The remainder of the profile is calcareous and ranges in pH from 8.O to 9.0. Unconformable very gravelly or gravelly, sandy or loamy materials underlie the duripans. These are weakly cemented in some pedons and range from hard to loose. Cementation decreases as depth increases."

Bellavista soils have mean annual soil temperatures more than 47 F., and are calcareous and moderately alkaline throughout the solum. Cortez and Usave soils have sola 22 to 36 inches thick, clay B2t horizons, and lime in the lower part of the solum.  Fertaline soils have 20- to 30-inch sola, abrupt AB boundaries, and columnar B2t horizons of clay texture. Minu soils are calcareous and moderately alkaline in the lower part of the solum, and have 1/8 to 1/4 inch silica-indurated laminae in a strongly cemented matrix. Umil soils have more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in their B2t horizons, are calcareous throughout the profile, and are moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline in the solum."
