  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ohana soils are on convex glaciated mountain slopes and broad ridgetops at elevations of 2,800 to 3,700 feet. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. These soils formed in mantle of volcanic ash and pebble-size rounded and subangular pumice over colluvium from glacial till and weathered tuff breccia over dense glacial till. The climate is characterized by cool dry summers and cool wet winters. Average annual\nprecipitation is 70 to 80 inches including considerable snow. Mean annual temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F. The growing season (28 F.) is 70 to 140 days."

Assume 5 to 11 inches has 15 bar dry of less than 15 percent and 15 bar moist of less than 30 percent. Assume 11 to 35 inches has 15 bar dry of more than 15 percent and 15 bar moist of less than 30 percent. (Vitric from 5 to 11 and non-vitric from 11 to 35 inches). The zone from 5 to 16 inches is considered medial and 16 to 35 inches is considered medial-skeletal. The thickest part is\nmedial-skeletal.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
