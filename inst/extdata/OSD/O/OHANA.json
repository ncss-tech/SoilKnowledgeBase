  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ohana series consists of moderately deep to densic material, well drained soils formed in a mantle of volcanic ash and pumice and colluvium and residuum from glacial till and tuff breccia over dense glacial till. Ohana soils are on convex mountain slopes and broad ridgetops at elevations of 2,800 to 3,700 feet. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 75 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 39\ndegrees F.",
