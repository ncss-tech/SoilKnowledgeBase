  "OVERVIEW": "The Oxendine series consists of shallow to a hardpan, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  These soils are on terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to duripan is 10 to 14 inches and the duripan is 10 to 15 inches thick over soft lacustrine tuff.  Depth to soft lacustrine tuff is 20 to 39 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from early March to early December (275 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F. from mid April to early November.  The soil moisture control section (8 inches to the duripan) is dry in all parts from early June to early November (145 to 155 days) and is moist in all parts from mid December to early May.  The particle-size control section (0 to 14 inches) averages 25 to 35 percent clay and 25 to 35 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  Base saturation by sum of cations ranges from 95 to 100 percent throughout. Organic matter ranges from 2 to 3 percent to a depth of 10 inches.  Some pedons have light colors on the surface but when mixed are dark enough for mollic colors. Rock fragments, mostly gravel, on the surface range from 35 to 75 percent.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/3 or 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.   Texture is very gravelly sandy loam, extremely gravelly sandy loam, or very cobbly sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 20 percent. Rock fragments range from 30 to 70 percent gravel and 5 to 30 percent cobbles.\nThe Bt horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, or 7.5YR 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 3/3 or 7.5YR 3/2.  Texture is sandy clay loam, clay loam,or very gravelly sandy clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 25 to 35 percent.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent gravel in the upper part and 10 to 30 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent cobbles in the lower part."
