  "OVERVIEW": "The Oklark series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly and moderately permeable soils that formed in calcareous alluvium of Tertiary age.  These soils are on very gently sloping to steep side slopes and foot slopes of uplands in the Southern High Plains Breaks (MLRA 77E).  Slopes range from 1 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Between the base of the A horizon and depth of 40 inches the soil contains a zone of accumulation of calcium carbonate that is greater than 5 percent visible carbonates and has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 percent or more.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 8 to 28 inches.  Below a depth of 24 inches, some pedons have a layer of calcium carbonate that is partially indurated, but do not contain a petrocalcic horizon.  The average clay content of the 10 to 40 inch section ranges from 10 to 18 percent.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 13 inches.  Coarse pebbles less than 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to 5 percent of all horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, clay loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons lack Bk horizons.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe BCk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Ck horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons contain strata of clay loam."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Pyeatt (AZ) series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Clark, Engle, Mansic, and Portales series.  Pyeatt soils occur at elevations above 4500 feet and have fewer frost free days. Clark, Engle, Mansic, and Portales soils have a fine-loamy control section.  In addition, Clark soils have a mesic temperature regime and Portales soils are dry for longer periods of time.  Engle soils have a Cr horizon and are moderately deep over calcareous sandstone."

Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 61 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 32 to 40.  Frost free days range from 190 to 210."

Abbie soils occur on slightly higher landscapes and have argillic horizons and have a fine-loamy control section.  Case soils do not have mollic surfaces and occur on slightly higher landscapes.  Fortyone soils occur on slightly higher landscapes and have argillic horizons and do not have calcic horizons.  Irene soils occur on slightly higher landscapes and have argillic horizons, have fine-silty control section, and do not have a calcic horizon. Farry soils occur on slightly higher landscapes and have argillic horizons, have a fine-loamy control section, and do not have a calcic horizon.\nTeagard, Wellsford and Woods soils have clayey textural control sections and occur at lower positions on the landscape."
