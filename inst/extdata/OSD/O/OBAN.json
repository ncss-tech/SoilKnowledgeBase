  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum is 24 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The soil between depths of about 4 and 12 inches is usually dry and in most years is not continuously moist for as long as 60 consecutive days in winter or spring.  Rock fragments of fine gravel size make up less than 5 percent of the A horizons and B horizons and less than 25 percent of the C horizons.  The A horizon is pale brown, light yellowish brown or very pale brown in 10YR hue.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam.  This horizon is massive in some or all parts or it has platy structure in some or all parts and is soft or slightly hard.  Vesicular pores occur just below the upper plates in pedons with platy structure near the surface.  This horizon is noneffervescent or is effervescent in some or all parts depending upon kind of local dust.  Some pedons have a thin or discontinuous thin A2 horizon.  The B2t horizon is pale brown, brown or yellowish brown in 10YR hue or light olive brown in 2.5Y hue.  It is heavy clay loam, heavy silty clay loam or light clay with about 35 to 45 percent clay absolute.  The upper part of this horizon has moderate or strong columnar or prismatic structure and an abrupt upper boundary.  The lower part of this horizon has moderate or strong columnar or prismatic structure and an abrupt upper boundary.\nThe lower part of this horizon has moderate or strong prismatic or angular blocky structure and a gradual lower boundary or a transitional horizon or both.  It is strongly or very strongly alkaline and has 15 to 40 percent exchangeable sodium.  Some or all parts are effervescent and lime segregations are only in the lower part.  The C horizon is somewhat stratified and is sandy loam to clay loam.  Some pedons have lenses with weak cementation in the C horizon within 40 inches of the surface.  Dominant cementing agent is calcium carbonate."

Pond soils have less than 35 percent clay in the natric horizon and have a xeric moisture regime.  Tray soils have less than 18 percent clay in an argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Oban soils are nearly level and are in valley troughs and basins at elevations of 2,300 to 2,500 feet.  They formed in alluvium derived mostly from granitic rock sources.  The climate is arid with long hot dry summers and cool somewhat moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches.  Average January temperature is 43 degrees F., average July temperature is 82 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 240 to 260 days."
