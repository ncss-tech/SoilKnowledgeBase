    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are extremely acid to slightly acid throughout.  They are fine sand or sand to depths of more than 80 inches.  Silt plus clay totals less than 5 percent between 10 and 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe upper part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Few to common, fine to coarse mottles or pockets of white or light gray uncoated sand grains occur in these horizons in some pedons, but are not indicative of wetness.  In some pedons, reddish yellow, strong brown, or yellowish brown redox features occur in the lower part of the C2 horizon below a depth of about 48inches.\nThe lower part of the C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 6 to 8; or value 7 or 8, chroma 1 or 2; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 7, and chroma of 4.  This horizon has redox features in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray.\nIn some pedons below a depth of about 60 inches, the Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2, with or without redox features in shades of red, yellow, gray, or black.  Some pedons have few to common particles of heavy mineral present in this horizon."

Leon, Lynn Haven, Pottsburg, and Ridgeland soils are poorly drained and have Bh horizons at depths of less than 30 inches.  In addition, Lynn Haven soils have umbric epipedons.  Mandarin soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a Bh horizon."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

A water table is between 48 and 80 inches in depth for 6 to 8 months during most years but recedes to depths greater than 80 inches during droughty periods.  The water table is above depths of 48 inches for periods of about 1 to 10 days duration after heavy rains during wet periods."

Natural vegetation consists of second growth slash and longleaf pine, turkey and blackjack oak, and scattered saw palmetto with an understory of pineland threeawn, low panicums, and grassleaf goldaster."
