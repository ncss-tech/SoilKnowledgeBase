Koko soils have hue of 5YR in the A horizon and upper part of the B horizon and lack prismatic structure in the B horizon.  Makena soils have an ochric epipedon.  Pakini soils have an epipedon too thin for a mollic epipedon, have weak structure in the B horizon and are high in olivine sand.  Waikaloa soils are silty clay loam in the IIB horizon and a mean annual soil temperature of 62 degrees F."

The landscape is made up of narrow ridges of Aa lava and moderately wide valleys.  Elevation ranges from 100 to 800 feet.  The soils formed in volcanic ash and cinders over Aa lava.  Annual rainfall is 15 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.; average January temperature is 70 degrees F.; average July temperature is 76 degrees F."
