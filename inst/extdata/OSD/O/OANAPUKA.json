  "OVERVIEW": "The Oanapuka series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash and cinders over Aa lava.  Oanapuka soils are on uplands and have slopes of 7 to 25 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 73 degrees F.",
