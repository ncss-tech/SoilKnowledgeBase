  "OVERVIEW": "The Ozark series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium over residuum from redbed clays and claystones of Permian age. These nearly level or very gently sloping soils are on treads and interdunal areas of sand sheets on stream terraces on alluvial plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.",
