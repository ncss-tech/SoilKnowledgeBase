  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 40 inches or more.  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.  Texture is sand or fine sand to depths of 80 inches or more.  Silt plus clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section is less than 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue N, value of 4 to 6.  A mixture of dark organic matter and light gray sand grains gives this horizon a salt-and-pepper effect when dry.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y,, value 6 of 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bw part of the B/E and Bh horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  The tongues of E horizon have the same colors as the E horizon.  The Bh parts of this horizon have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Tongues of the E horizon extending into the B horizon range from none to common. Thus only a Bw would be in pedons without tongues.   The Bh portion of the horizon occurs at the contact of the E and B horizon as discontinuous layers or lenses 1/4 to 2 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4 with or without mottles in shades of gray, red, yellow, or brown."

Dade soils have a Cr horizon at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Paola soils lack evidence of wetness within depths of 80 inches.  Welaka soils have mixed sand and shell fragments below depths of 40 inches.  Astatula, Candler, and St. Lucie soils are better drained and lack evidence of Bh horizons.  In addition, Astatula soils lack E horizons, Candler soils have lamellae, and St. Lucie soils lack B horizons.  Tavares soils lack E horizons and evidence of Bh horizons."

Precipitation averages 50 to 60 inches annually and mean annual air temperature is about 70 to 74 degrees F."
