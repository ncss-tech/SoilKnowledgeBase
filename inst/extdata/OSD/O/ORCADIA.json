Runoff is very high unless the glossic horizon has a saturated hydraulic conductivity of 0.6 or greater that extends below a depth of 50 cm (20 in); in which case, the runoff is high.  The soil is rarely flooded for very brief to brief periods. Flooding occurs as a result of storm surge during tropical storms which occurs in areas less than 4.6 m (15 ft) elevation. These soils have episaturation from 20 to 100 cm (8 to 40 in) below the soil surface from January to March and endosaturation from 122 to 203 cm (48 to 80 in) below the surface during the same period."
