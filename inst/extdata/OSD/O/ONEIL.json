  "OVERVIEW": "The Oneil series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on rolling to steep foothills.  They have formed in material weathered from calcareous sandstone and shale and have slopes of 8 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

The soil between the depths of 4 and 12 inches is moist throughout from about December 1 to May 1 and dry throughout from about July 1 to November 1 most years.  The soil temperature is warmer than 47 degrees F. from January 30 through December 1.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 62 degrees F.  Particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay content and 45 to 66 percent silt content and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Twenty five to 50 percent of the surface has been removed by erosion.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent and the silt content ranges from 50 to 70 percent.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent.  Typically is slightly effervescent but ranges from slightly to strongly effervescent.\nThe Ck horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/6 or 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 5/4.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The clay content ranges from 20 to 35 percent and the silt content ranges from 50 to 70 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 14 percent.
