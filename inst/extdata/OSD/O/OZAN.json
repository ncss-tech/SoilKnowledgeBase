  "OVERVIEW": "The Ozan series consists of deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium.  These level soils are on flood plains and concave depressional low terraces along streams in the Western Coastal Plain.  Mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 49 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",
