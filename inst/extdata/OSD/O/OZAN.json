    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Gessner series in the same family and Clodine, Colita, Plank, Sorter, Vimville, and Waller in closely related families.  Gessner soils are neutral to moderately alkaline in the argillic horizon.  Colita, Vimville, and Waller soils are in a fine-loamy particle size class.  Clodine and Sorter soils do not have glossic properties and Plank soils are in a coarse-silty particle size class."

Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 49 inches."

Kirkville soils, which occur on adjacent terraces, do not have an argillic horizons and are better drained.  Sardis soils, which occur on similar landscapes, do not have argillic horizons and are better drained.

Some areas of these soils commonly flood a few times each year, usually during winter and early spring.  A seasonally high water table is within 6 inches of the soil surface from December through April."
