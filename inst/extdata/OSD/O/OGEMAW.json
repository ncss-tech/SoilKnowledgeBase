  "OVERVIEW": "The Ogemaw series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy outwash and in the underlying till or lacustrine deposits on ground moraines, lake plains, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
