    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ogemaw soils are on ground moraines, lake plains, and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. These soils formed in sandy outwash 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick and in the underlying till or lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 838 mm (27 to 33 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 8.3 degrees C (41 to 47 degrees F)."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is very low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high above the Bsm horizon, moderately high or high in the Bsm horizon, and moderately high or moderately low in the C horizon. Permeability is rapid in the A, E and Bs horizons, moderate or moderately rapid in the Bsm horizon and slow or moderately slow in the C horizon."
