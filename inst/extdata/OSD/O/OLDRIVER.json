Elevations are 280 to 500 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 7 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 85 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."

Kimberlina and Wasco soils are on adjacent low alluvial fans, are coarse-loamy and have a regular decrease in organic matter.  Panoche soils are on adjacent low alluvial fans and have a regular decrease in organic matter.  Weedpatch soils are on adjacent relic basin floors and have a calcic horizon."

Oldriver soils have been artificially drained and protected from flooding in most areas by dams, levees, and diversions.  The partially drained phase of this soil has a water table at a depth of 4 to 6 feet from March through August as a result of irrigation and below 6 feet during the rest of the year."
