  "OVERVIEW": "The Oldriver series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stream alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rock.  This soil is now artificially drained.  Oldriver soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
