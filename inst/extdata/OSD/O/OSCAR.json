  "OVERVIEW": "The Oscar series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from loamy alluvium.  These nearly level to very gently sloping soils are on flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Prairies.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 33 inches. Mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.",

Soft powdery secondary lime is within a depth of 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam. Structure ranges from massive to weak fine platy or weak fine granular.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 75 percent. Electrical conductivity ranges from 0 to 16 mmhos/cm.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 24 to 35 percent.  Structure is columnar, prismatic, or blocky.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 15 to about 80 percent and the electrical conductivity ranges from 4 to about 16 mmhos/cm.  Reaction ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe BCn or C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 24 to 35 percent. Exchangeable sodium and electrical conductivity are about the same as the Btn horizon.  Reaction ranges from slightly to very strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have buried A or Bw horizons below 30 inches, but these are not diagnostic.  Where present, hue is 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

Crot soils have more than 15 percent material that is coarser than very fine sand.  Drummond, Pawhuska, and Wing soils have more than 35 percent average content in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  Drummond and Pawhuska soils also have dark A1 horizon and Wing soils have 2 chroma mottles within 20 inches of the surface."

Oscar soils occur in roughly circular areas from 20 to 100 feet in diameter.  Oscar soils are formed in loamy alluvium that was either high in sodium or received additions of sodium after deposition.  The climate is moist subhumid.\nMean Annual Precipitation: 26 to 40 inches;\nMean Annual Temperature: 58 to 64 degrees F.\nThornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 44 to 64."
