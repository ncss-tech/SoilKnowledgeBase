Depth to carbonates ranges from 43 to 114 cm (17 to 45 in). Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent. Reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral in the surface layer, from moderately acid through slightly alkaline in the subsoil, and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction  is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay. Structure is medium granular, but is weak or moderate fine subangular or angular blocky in some pedons. Consistence is friable or firm.\nE horizons up to 4 inches thick are in some pedons. They have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2. The E horizons  have textures similar to the Ap horizons, and have weak subangular or angular blocky or platy structure.\nThe Bt/E, when present, has colors similar similar to the E and the Bt horizons for their respective parts. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. The composition of the E material is less than 15 percent of the layer.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R through 5YR, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Subhorizons of some pedons may have 7.5YR hue. Texture of the fine-earth fraction  is silty clay loam, silty clay,  or clay. Structure is coarse or very coarse angular blocky or subangular blocky, or it is prismatic that parts to blocky. Consistence is very firm or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10R through 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is  silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. Some pedons have thin or very thin, (varved) sub-horizons of very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, or silt. Structure is thick platy, very coarse prismatic, or it is massive. Consistence is very firm or firm."

Brockport and Lockport soils have bedrock within depths of 102 cm (40 inches). Churchville soils have a lithologic discontinuity and 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the series control section. Caneadea, Remsen and Rhinebeck soils have hues of 7.5YR or yellower throughout the subsoil horizons.\nThe Bennington, Blount, Del Ray, Fulton, Kimmel, Mahoning, Nappanee. Bennington, Blount, Del Ray, Fulton, Kimmel, Mahoning, and Nappanee series are in related families, and all these soils have hues of 10YR or yellower throughout the subsoil."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Some mapped areas have inclusions of an unrecognized series that are in the subgroup Glossaquic Hapludalfs. Original classification placed Odessa in the great group of Ochraqualfs. Because of changes established in the 8th edition of `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the new great group of Endoaqualfs. Competing series are expected to increase as similar soils are reclassified.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to  20 cm (Ap horizon)\n2) Argillic horizon - from  20 to 64 cm (Bt/E, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons)\n3) Aeric subgroup - as evidenced by a horizon having hue of 7.5YR or redder of the matrix and chroma of 2 or more on the exterior of peds in a subhorizon between the base of the Ap horizon and 76 cm (Bt1 horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
