Reaction ranges from moderately acid to extremely acid in A horizon and from strongly acid to extremely acid in the B, BC and C horizons.  Ironstone fragments range from 0 to 5 percent by volume throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has dominant hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles with chroma of 3 to 6, if present, range from few to common.  Texture is sandy clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have thin sandy clay subhorizons in the upper part of the Bt horizon.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Mottles with chroma of 2 to 6 range from few to many.  The BC horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam,  Some pedons have thin strata of clay loam, sandy clay loam, or clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4, or has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.

Apison, Hartsells, Linker, and Pirum soils are underlain by hard bedrock.  Cahaba soils have Bt horizons in hue of 5YR or redder.  Cowarts soils have low activity clays in the control section.  Durham and Granville soils have fragments of igneous rocks in the control section.  Emporia, Marvyn, and Suffolk soils do not have mottles in the BC horizons.  Euharlee soils contain more silt and are developing from cherty limestone.  Kempsville and Vaucluse soils have subhorizons that contain 10 to 60 percent brittle bodies.  Nauvoo, Sipsey, and Stringtown soils are underlain by soft sandstone or shale at depths of 60 inches or less.  Spadra and Smithdale soils have Bt horizons with hue of 5YR or redder.  Bowie soils have more than 5 percent in subhorizons of the lower argillic horizon.  Ruston soils have thicker sola and Bt horizons with hue of 5YR or redder.  Sacul soils have more than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon."

Cadeville soils are at slightly higher elevations and they have a fine particle size-control section.  The Larue soils, on similar landscape positions, have sandy epipedons 20 to 40 inches thick.  Savannah soils have a fragipan and are typically on less sloping areas.  The competing Smithdale soils are on similar landscapes and the competing Ruston soils are on less sloping areas."
