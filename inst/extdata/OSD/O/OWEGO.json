  "OVERVIEW": "The Owego series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in clayey and silty alluvium. These soils are on flood plains in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 810 millimeters.",
