  "OVERVIEW": "The Ontrail series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and till from sedimentary and volcanic rock sources of the Ventura Member of the Midnight Peak Formation, with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on backslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 35 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 days following the summer solstice.  These soils do not meet the organic carbon content of 0.6 or more for mollic epipedons.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 10 to 20 inches, and has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.40 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 5 to 12 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hues of 5YR and 7.5YR, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hues of 5YR and 7.5YR, values of 5 or 6 dry, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is gravelly ashy sandy loam or very gravelly ashy sandy loam. It has 15 to 35 percent gravels.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, and chromas of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very cobbly sandy loam.  It has 30 to 45 percent pebbles and 5 to 20 percent cobbles."

Brevco, Kamela, Redpeak, Santop and Thout soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact.  Coxit soils lack red hues and have 8 to 18 percent clay.  Elkrock soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 45 to 47 degrees F. and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the C horizon.  Highhorn soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and bedrock at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.   Huntrock soils have 27 to 35 percent clay and 60 to 80 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Jimbluff soils lack red hues and have extremely gravelly loamy sand 3C horizons.  Longort soils lack red hues and have Cd horizons.  Merkel soils lack red hues and have Cd horizon."
