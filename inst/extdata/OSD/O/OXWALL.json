    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C. (51 to 56 degrees F.).  Depth to the indurated duripan is 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches).  Bedrock is at a depth of 154 centimeters (60 inches) or more.  The mollic epipedon is 18 to 38 centimeters (7 to 15 inches) thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or loam with 0 to 50 percent surface stones, 0 to 30 percent cobbles and 5 to 35 percent gravel.\nSome pedons have a AB or BA horizon which has color similar to the A horizon.  It is loam or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 25 percent rounded rock fragments.\nThe Btss horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It has 40 to 60 percent clay.  It has moderate or strong prismatic and angular blocky structure.  Rounded rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent and are dominantly gravel.\nThe 2Bqm horizon is indurated and has 30 to 80 percent rounded rock fragments.  Stratified gravelly to extremely gravelly loamy and sandy material which may range from strongly to weakly cemented, underlies the indurated horizon."

The soil formed in mixed alluvial sediments.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches).  The mean annual temperature is about 7 to 10 degrees C. (45 to 50 degrees F.).  The frost-free period is 70 to 140 days."

The Belshaw soils are on side slopes of hills, are very deep, and formed from volcanic tuff. Prill soils are on benches and side slopes of hills and are moderately deep to volcanic tuff.  Starkey soils are on benches and side slopes of hills and are shallow to volcanic tuff.  Oxbow soils are 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to a duripan and are formed on old alluvial fans.  Tub soils are on hillsides and are deep over volcanic tuff.  The Zweygardt soils are on old fan terrace side slopes, are clayey-skeletal, and very deep."
