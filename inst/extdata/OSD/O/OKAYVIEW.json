  "OVERVIEW": "The Okayview series consists of shallow to soft bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from welded tuff. The Okayview soils are on rock pediments and mountains. Slopes are 4 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
