These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  The climate is humid with cool moist summers and cold moist winters.  Elevations are 6,400 to 7,300 feet.  Average annual precipitation ranges from l8 to 24 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 1/4 F; average January temperature is 26 1/4 F.; average July temperature is 64 1/4 F.  Frost-free season varies from 75 to l00 days."

McVickers soils lack an abrupt boundary between the A2 and argillic horizons.  Soldier soils are medium to very strongly acid in the lower solum."

Some update was made to horizon nomenclature, competing series section, etc.  Other placements may be more appropriate after a complete update.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 1 to 3 inches (A horizon)\nAlbic horizon - The zone from 3 to 11 inches (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 11 to 43 inches (Bt horizons)\nAbrupt textural change and Pale- feature - The increase of more than 20 percent clay with an abrubt boundary at 11 inches. (E to Bt1 horizons)\nClassified according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth edition, 2006\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
