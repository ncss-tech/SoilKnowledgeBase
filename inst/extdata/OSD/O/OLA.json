Slopes are 6 to 80 percent.  Elevations range from 900 to 2,000 meters in Idaho.  Elevations are as high as 2,300 meters on south-facing slopes in northern Nevada.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 600 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 65 to 100 days."

Brownlee soils are fine-loamy, deep or very deep, have argillic horizons, and have a mesic temperature regime.  Brownlee soils are on dissected terraces and fans. Lochsa soils are deeper than 100 cm to bedrock and are on mountains. Rainey soils are coarse-loamy, moderately deep, have thin mollic epipedons, a mesic temperature regime, and are on south-facing mountain slopes. Yakus soils are loamy, very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts, and are on south and west-facing canyon walls."
