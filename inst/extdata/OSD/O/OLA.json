  "OVERVIEW": "The Ola series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from intrusive igneous and metamorphic rocks. Ola soils are on pediments, hills, and mountains. Slopes are 6 to 80 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

Lochsa soils are deeper than 100 cm to bedrock and are on mountains. Rainey soils are coarse-loamy, moderately deep, have thin mollic epipedons, a mesic temperature regime, and are on south-facing mountain slopes. Yakus soils are loamy, very shallow and shallow to lithic contacts, and are on south and west-facing canyon walls."
