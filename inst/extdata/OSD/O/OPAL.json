  "OVERVIEW": "The Opal series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in clayey sediments weathered from clay shale on dissected upland plains and hills.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 460 millimeters (18 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).",

They do not have mollic epipedons and contain more salts.  Dupree and Sansarc soils typically are on steeper areas on the landscape.  They have bedrock at depths of 25 to 50 centimeters (about 10 to 20 inches).  Hurley soils are on less sloping landscapes.  They have a natric horizon.  Lakoma soils are on similar landscapes.  They do not have a mollic epipedon or intersecting slickensides."
