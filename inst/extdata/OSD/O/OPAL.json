Bullcreek and Promise soils are on toeslopes and flats below the Opal soils.  They are more than 100 centimeters (about 40 inches) deep to shale.  Chantier soils are on steeper landscapes.  They do not have mollic epipedons and contain more salts.  Dupree and Sansarc soils typically are on steeper areas on the landscape.  They have bedrock at depths of 25 to 50 centimeters (about 10 to 20 inches).  Hurley soils are on less sloping landscapes.  They have a natric horizon.  Lakoma soils are on similar landscapes.  They do not have a mollic epipedon or intersecting slickensides."
