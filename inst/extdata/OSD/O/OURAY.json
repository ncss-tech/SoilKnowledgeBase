  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 62 to 65 degrees F.  These soils are usually noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 80 to 100 percent.  Depth to the sandy C or 2C horizon ranges from 12 to 30 inches.  The upper part of the particle size control section is usually sandy loam but clay averages 5 to 18 percent, silt 0 to 40 percent, and sand 50 to 95 percent with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  Loamy very fine sand or finer textures are excluded from the above range except sandy loams may be included on a weighted average basis.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume and are usually 3 inches in diameter.  The soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4."

Kippen soils lack moderately coarse textured layers 15 inches thick or less in the upper part of the control section and have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick.  Lonetree soils have hue of 5YR or redder in a major part of the control section."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium or glacial outwash.  The average annual precipitation is 12 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F.  Elevation is 6,600 to 7,700 feet and frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."
