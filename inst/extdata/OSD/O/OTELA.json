  "OVERVIEW": "The Otela series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately slowly to slowly permeable soils on broad uplands.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments over limestone on karst topography.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is 68 degrees and the mean annual precipitation is 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A and E horizons, and from extremely acid to slightly alkaline in the upper Bt horizons and from extremely acid to moderately alkaline in the lower Bt horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown or yellow range from none to common.  Some pedons have many pockets of white uncoated sand grains.  Thin lamellae having texture of loamy fine sand or sandy loam are present in most pedons.  Pebble-sized ironstone nodules, less than about 5 percent by volume, occur in the lower parts of the E horizon in some pedons.  Pebble to cobble-sized limestone or chert fragments, less than about 5 percent by volume, may be present in the E and EB horizons in some pedons.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe EB horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Bt horizon.  Texture is loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, red, or yellow range from few to many.  The weighted average clay content is 15 to 35 percent in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  In some pedons, less than about 5 percent, by volume, pebble to stone-sized limestone or chert fragments may be present.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, yellow, brown, or red range from none to many.  In some pedons, about 5 percent, by volume, pebble or cobble-sized limestone or chert fragments may be present in the lower part.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay.  Some pedons have a 2Btg horizon that has texture of sandy clay or clay.\nThe BC horizon, where present, is at depths greater than 60 inches.  It has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Cr horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is composed of soft, weathered, fractured limestone that can be dug with a spade, has very firm to extremely firm rupture resistance with low to high excavation difficulty.  It usually contains soft carbonate accumulations and few to many hard limestone or chert fragments.  It is highly irregular and complex, interspersed with solution holes 4 to 12 inches in diameter, are variable within short distances, and are filled with sandy loam to sandy clay textured soil material.\nThe R horizon, where present, consists of hard, unweathered limestone that has slightly rigid to very rigid rupture resistance with very high to extremely high excavation difficulty.  Some areas have solution holes."
