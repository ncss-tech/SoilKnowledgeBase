  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist throughout unless drained and not irrigated. Mottles and matrix chroma of 1 or 2 occur within 20 inches of the surface. Drained areas generally have a water table between depths of 20 and 48 inches. The soils are generally calcareous in all parts. The mean soil temperature is about 61 degrees F. All or some of the upper part of the profile shows stratification and the organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.\nThe A horizon ranges from gray to grayish brown and olive gray in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral and has mottles in the lower part in some pedons. It is silty clay loam or clay. This horizon has about 2 percent organic matter. It is blocky or prismatic.\nThe B2 horizon ranges from light gray and gray to pale olive and light olive gray in hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or neutral. The B2 horizon and the 10 to 40 inch zone average silty clay or clay. They are moderately or strongly alkaline and have accumulations of lime in upper portions that decrease with depth. Many soft masses and concretions of pale yellow (5Y 7/3) to red (2.5YR 4/8) are typical in the lower portion of the horizon being more pronounced in some pedons than in others.\nThe C horizon, if present, is mottled in hue of 5Y or 2.5Y with chroma of I to 3. It ranges from light clay loam to silty clay. Lime may or may not be present. The buried horizons are typically stratified in color and texture."

Alviso and Egbert soils are not calcareous in the 10 to 20 inch section. Bayshore, Castro, and Sunnyvale soils have horizons of marked lime Accumulation or calcic horizons. Glann, Maria, Reyes, Tyndall, and Valdez soils lack mollic epipedons; all but Reyes have less than 35 percent clay. Merritt soils have less than 35 percent clay. Sacramento soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches thick that are noncalcareous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Omni soils are in nearly level concave basin areas at elevations of 5 to 150 feet. The sediments are of mixed origin. The climate is dry subhumid, mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual rainfall is 17 to 18 inches. Mean annual temperature is 58 degrees F., average January temperature about 42 degrees F., and average July temperature about 75 degrees F. Frostfree season averages about 265 days."
