Amanda, Chili, Gallman, Kanawha, and Mocksville soils do not have rock fragments dominantly of igneous lithology. Belmont, High Gap, Lumberton, Military, and Woodbine soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Belmore soils have more than 5 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Caprell soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Cliftycreek soils have more than 32 percent clay in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Conestoga and Hickory soils have less than 45 percent sand in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Crouse, Greybrook, Martinsville, Skelton, and Wawaka soils have less than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon. Hollinger, Kidder, Kosciusko, LeRoy, Relay, Senachwine, Strawn, and Wawasee soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Princeton soils do not have rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ockley soils are commonly on stream terraces and outwash plains, and less commonly on kame moraines and eskers. Slope gradient commonly is 0 to 6 percent on stream terraces and outwash plains, and 2 to 30 percent on kame moraines and eskers. The soils formed in as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash. They are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1143 mm (30 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 13 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 122 to 335 meters (400 to 1,100 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: They are commonly associated with Fox, Rush, Sleeth, and Westland soils on outwash plains and stream terraces. They are less commonly associated with Miami and Russell soils which are on adjacent till plains. The well drained Fox soils are moderately deep to stratified gravelly and sandy outwash and are typically on shoulders and backslopes. The moderately well drained Miami and well drained Russell soils are on summits, shoulders, and backslopes of dissected till plains. The well drained, more silty Rush soils are on similar landforms as the Ockley soils. The somewhat poorly drained Sleeth soils are on nearly level summits of outwash plains. The poorly drained and very poorly drained Westland soils are in depressions on outwash plains and stream terraces."

These will likely be proposed as new series when the subset surveys with these phases are updated.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for the typical pedon, S1979IN139009, from the Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory (KSSL), Lincoln, Nebraska. Data for pedons sampled by the Agricultural Experiment Station at Purdue University and at The Ohio State University are also available from KSSL.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
