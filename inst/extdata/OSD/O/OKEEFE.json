  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Okeefe series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy materials and the underlying loamy materials on outwash plains, moraines and lake basins.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and moderate in the loamy material.  Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",
