The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days; udic moisture regime.  Depth to outwash material is 20 to 40 inches.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has andic soil properties with phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron of 2 to 4 percent, and 15 to 25 percent apparent clay.  The lower part of the particle-size control section has 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The soils may have an ochric or umbric epipedon.\nThe A horizon has 0 to 5 percent gravel and has 10 to 20 percent organic matter.  Value is 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is extremely or very strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is very strongly acid or strongly acid.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel and has 5 to 20 percent organic matter.\nThe 2Bw or 2C horizon contains 35 to 60 percent gravel and has 1 to 5 percent organic matter.  Moist bulk density is 1.25 to 1.35 g/cc.  Value is 4 or 5 moist, 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is loam, sandy loam or silt loam."

They occur in a coastal marine climate with cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers. Annual precipitation is 90 to 120 inches. The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F., mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. The growing season is 180 to 220 days."
