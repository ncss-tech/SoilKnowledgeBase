  "STATES": "IN,MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ormas series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in wind reworked sandy outwash on high terraces or uplands with a plane or convex surface. They are deep or very deep to calcareous gravelly and sandy deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
