Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days.

The somewhat poorly drained Brady soils and the moderately well drained Branch and Bronson soils are on lower positions and in drainageways. The excessively drained Chelsea soils are on knolls and ridges and are sandier and do not have an argillic horizon. The well drained Fox and Kosciusko soils are on similar landforms and have loamy surface layers and a more clayey argillic horizon. The well drained Oshtemo soils are on similar landforms and do not have sandy surface layers more than 51 cm (20 inches) thick."
