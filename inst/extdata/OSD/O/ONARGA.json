Ade soils have argillic horizons that consist of lamellae or bands. Jasper soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. The somewhat poorly drained La Hogue soils and the poorly drained Selma soils have more clay in the particle-size control section and are on slightly lower positions in the landscape. The somewhat poorly drained Ridgeville soils form a drainage sequence with the Onarga soils and are on adjoining lower elevations."
