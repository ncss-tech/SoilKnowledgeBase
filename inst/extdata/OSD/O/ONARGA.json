Malardi soils have free carbonates within 46 cm (18 inches) of the surface and contain more than 2 percent coarse fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Norborne soils have mollic epipedons greater than 61 cm (24 inches) thick.  Rasset soils have, in the lower part of the series control section, more coarser sand and very coarse sand than fine sand and very fine sand."

They are on summits, shoulders and backslopes on stream terraces, outwash plains, beach ridges and lake plains. Slope gradients range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 8.9 to 12.8 degrees C (48 to 55 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1016 mm (32 to 40 inches), frost free days ranges from 160 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 107 to 213 meters (350 to 700 feet) above mean sea level."

Ade soils have argillic horizons that consist of lamellae or bands. Jasper soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. The somewhat poorly drained La Hogue soils and the poorly drained Selma soils have more clay in the particle-size control section and are on slightly lower positions in the landscape. The somewhat poorly drained Ridgeville soils form a drainage sequence with the Onarga soils and are on adjoining lower elevations."

The percent clay in the particle-size control section has been expanded from 12 to 18 percent.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nmollic epipedon -zone from the surface to a depth of 46 cm (18 inches) (Ap and A horizons);\nargillic horizon -zone from approximately 46 to 84 cm (18 to 33 inches) (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nAdditional Data: Site of typical pedon 85IL-125-046 from Mason County Illinois, University of Illinois Soil Characterization Lab.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
