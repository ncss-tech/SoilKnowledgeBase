  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle and depth to loamy till ranges from 36 to 60 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches. The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 18 to 27 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent. The ratio of coarse silt to fine silt in the silty mantle ranges from about 1.25 to 2.50. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle and from 3 to 35 percent in the underlying till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the till. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the silty mantle, but it ranges to neutral in Ap horizon where the soil is limed. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the till.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Where value moist is 3, value dry is 6 or more. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon 1 to 4 inches thick, with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nOtterholt soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a C horizon in the silty mantle with color like the Bt part above. It is silt loam.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6. It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or their gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.65 to 1.90 g/cm3.\nThe 2C horizon has color and texture like the 2Bt horizon above. Some pedons have a 2Cd horizon below a depth of 60 inches. Bulk density ranges from 1.70 to 1.95 g/cm3. Some pedons have small pockets or thin strata of loamy sand or gravely loamy sand."
