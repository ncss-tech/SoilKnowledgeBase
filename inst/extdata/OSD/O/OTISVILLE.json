  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 14 to 36 inches. Rock fragments mainly consist of acid siltstone and shale, with some quartz.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. In forested areas the A horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick. Texture ranges from loam to loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction. Consistence is friable or very friable. Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to medium, granular. Rock fragments range from 0 to 40 percent, and include up to 5 percent cobbles and stones. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid. Areas that have been limed range to neutral.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is very weak or weak, very fine to coarse, granular or subangular blocky, or is single grain. Rock fragments range from 20 to 75 percent, and include up to 10 percent cobbles and stones. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture ranges from loamy sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction, and is commonly stratified. Rock fragments range from 30 to 70 percent, and include up to 15 percent cobbles and stones. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bonaparte, Hinckley, Manchester, Mecosta, Multorpor, Quonset and Riker (T) series. Bonaparte soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the substratum. Hinckley soils have rock fragments consisting of granite, gneiss and schist. Manchester soils have hues of 5YR or redder in the substratum. Mecosta soils have carbonates within a depth of 15 to 40 inches. Multorpor soils have mean annual precipitation ranging from 80 to 120 inches. Quonset soils have rock fragments consisting of phyllite, shale, slate, schist and gneiss. Riker soils have carboliths and pieces of coal or coal slag in the series control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Otisville soils formed in Wisconsinan age outwash and are on long narrow ridges, summits, shoulders and sideslopes on terraces, kames and eskers on outwash plains, and on beaches and offshore bars on lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 50 inches. The frost free period ranges from 135 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 570 to 860 feet above msl."
