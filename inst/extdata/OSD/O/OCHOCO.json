Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.\nThe A and BA horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 dry and moist.  Phosphate retention is 15 to 25 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 0.4 to 0.8 percent.  It has 10 to 30 percent glass.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has weak or moderate medium subangular blocky and weak moderate prismatic structure.  It has 0 to 10 percent sand-size pumice decreasing with depth.  It has 0 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe 3B horizon is stratified sand to sandy loam with 35 to 70 percent gravel and cobbles.  It is loose and single grained or massive."
