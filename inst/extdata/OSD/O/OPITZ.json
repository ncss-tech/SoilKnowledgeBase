  "OVERVIEW": "The Opitz series consists of well drained soils that are moderately deep to grus, and deep to hard bedrock.  These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium, and residuum from coarse grained igneous rocks and coarse grained metamorphic rocks.  These soils are on ridges, plateaus, and sideslopes of mountains. Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
