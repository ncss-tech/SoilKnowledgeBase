  "OVERVIEW": "The Overshue series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial sediments overlying till. Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and moderately slow in the underlying till.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 46 degree F, and mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches.",

Thickness of the mollic epipedon is typically 10 to 24 inches, but ranges from 10 to 30 inches and extends into the Bw horizon in most pedons.  Depth to carbonates typically correspond to the depth to the till.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is fine sandy loam, but is very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It has few to common faint to prominent redox features.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is typically fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, but some pedons have a thin loamy sand or loamy fine sand layer in the lower part of the Bw horizon.
