  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to till ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is typically 10 to 24 inches, but ranges from 10 to 30 inches and extends into the Bw horizon in most pedons.  Depth to carbonates typically correspond to the depth to the till.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is fine sandy loam, but is very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.  It has few to common faint to prominent redox features.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is typically fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, but some pedons have a thin loamy sand or loamy fine sand layer in the lower part of the Bw horizon.  It has few to many, faint to prominent redox features.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a thin C horizon above the till that is typically loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe 2Bkg horizon has hue or 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4. It is clay loam or loam.  Redox features range from common to many and faint to prominent.  It has common or many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonates.  It is slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.  Few fine or medium accumulations of carbonates are present in some pedons. Redox features range from common to many and faint to prominent.  It is slightly to strongly alkaline."

The moderately well drained Carthage and Forestburg and well drained Ethan and Hand soils are on nearby upland positions.  In addition, Ethan and Hand soils are fine-loamy and the Forestburg soils are sandy over loamy. The somewhat poorly drained Elsmere soils are on nearby swales and are sandy.  The poorly drained Toko soils are in deeper and commonly larger depressions and are fine-loamy."
