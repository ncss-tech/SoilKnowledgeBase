  "OVERVIEW": "The Ossineke series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy basal till on ground moraines, disintegration moraines, and drumlins. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
