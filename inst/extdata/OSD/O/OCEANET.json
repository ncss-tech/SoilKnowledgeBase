  "OVERVIEW": "The Oceanet series consists of well drained soils that are shallow and very shallow to soft, calcareous sandstone.  These soils formed in residuum and local alluvium weathered from the underlying bedrock.  Oceanet soils are on low rolling and steep hillslopes and summits.  Slopes are typically complex and range from 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact ranges from 4 to 20 inches.  Organic matter content ranges from 0.5 to 2 percent in the upper few inches and decreases rapidly and uniformly with depth.  The particle size control section is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam with 5 to 18 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, and 52 to 80 percent sand with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser excluding any loamy sand textures.  Rock fragments are typically less than 15 percent but may range from 0 to 35 percent flat channers or semirounded sandstone fragments.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from about 47 to 52 degrees F.  EC is less than 2 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  The surface may be covered with a gravel or channery lag from colluvial action upslope.  Reaction ranges from mildly through strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Calcium carbonate ranges from 1 to 5 percent with no continuous horizons of visible secondary accumulation.  A thin Bw horizon may be present in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon consists of soft, calcareous sandstone interbedded with thin lenses of siltstone and shale.  Thin, discontinuous lenses of hard sandstone occur in some pedons.  This material is many 10's of feet thick in most areas."

Celeton soils have 80 to 100 percent diatomaceous earth fragments in the C horizon and a mean annual soil temperature of 53 to 57 degrees F.  Roic soils have less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the particle size control section and formed in lacustrine sediments.  Shalet soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle size control section, mean annual soil temperature of 54 to 59 degrees F., and occur in areas of 10 to 13 inches of precipitation\nand 165 to 175 frost-free days."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum and local alluvium weathered from soft, calcareous sandstone.  Elevations range from 4,800 to 6,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and ranges from 5 to 9 inches with about half falling as rain or snow in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 43 to 50 degrees F.  Estimated frost-free season is 110 to 140 days depending upon aspect, elevation, and air drainage."
