These soils have a marine climate with cool, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The annual precipitation is 90 to 120 inches. The mean January temperature is 38 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 59 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 180 to 220 days."
