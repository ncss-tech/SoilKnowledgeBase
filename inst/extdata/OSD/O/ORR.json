Bjork, Dodes, Indiano, Madras, Pahrange, Quiero, Shoebend, Simcoe, and Uhaldi soils have bedrock within 100 cm.  Cowiche soils have an A horizon and an upper Bt horizon formed in loess 46 to 100 cm thick over unconformable residuum and are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Fernpoint soils have argillic horizons that are less than 89 cm thick and have extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly 2C horizons.  Hullsgulch soils have horizons with lamellae below the argillic horizon.  Jerusalem soils have rock fragments that are mainly fine gravel of granitic lithology.  Margerum soils have 20 to 40 percent ash and pumice.  Quailridge soils are 30 to 64 cm to the base of the argillic horizon and have horizons with lamellae below the argillic horizon.  Ralls soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and are influenced by loess.  Truax soils have argillic horizons less than 81 cm thick, silica cementation in the C horizon, and average less than 15 percent rock fragments."
