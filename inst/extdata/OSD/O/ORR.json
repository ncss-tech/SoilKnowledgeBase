  "OVERVIEW": "The Orr series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Orr soils are on fan remnants, stream terraces, inset fans, and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Fernpoint soils have argillic horizons that are less than 89 cm thick and have extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly 2C horizons.  Hullsgulch soils have horizons with lamellae below the argillic horizon.  Jerusalem soils have rock fragments that are mainly fine gravel of granitic lithology.  Margerum soils have 20 to 40 percent ash and pumice.  Quailridge soils are 30 to 64 cm to the base of the argillic horizon and have horizons with lamellae below the argillic horizon.  Ralls soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and are influenced by loess.
