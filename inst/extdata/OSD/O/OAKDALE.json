  "OVERVIEW": "The Oakdale series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic rock sources.  They are on nearly level to gently sloping alluvial fans and terraces and in slightly depressed stream channels traversing alluvial fans with slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 61 degrees F.",

The soil between the depth of 10 and 29 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to October 15 and is moist in all parts from November 15 to May 15.  Very coarse plus coarse sand is greater than 15 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has dry colors of 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/4, 5/3, or 5/2 dry and 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3 3/4 or 7.5YR 3/4 moist.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam and fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.  Organic matter content is 1.2 to 2 percent above 4 inches and is less than 1 percent below that depth.\nThe Bt horizon has colors of 10YR or 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4, 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3 dry and 10YR or 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/4 or 4/3 moist.  Texture ranges from coarse sandy loam to light sandy clay loam with 15 to 25 percent clay and a average in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon of less than 18 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 5/4, 4/4, or 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4 or 4/3 dry and 10YR or 7.5YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3 or 3/3 moist.
