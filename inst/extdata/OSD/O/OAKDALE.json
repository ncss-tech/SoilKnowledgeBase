The soil between the depth of 10 and 29 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to October 15 and is moist in all parts from November 15 to May 15.  Very coarse plus coarse sand is greater than 15 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Ap or A horizon has dry colors of 7.5YR 5/4; 10YR 5/4, 5/3, or 5/2 dry and 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3 3/4 or 7.5YR 3/4 moist.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam and fine sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay. Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.  Organic matter content is 1.2 to 2 percent above 4 inches and is less than 1 percent below that depth.\nThe Bt horizon has colors of 10YR or 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4, 5/2, 5/3, 4/2, 4/3 dry and 10YR or 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/4 or 4/3 moist.  Texture ranges from coarse sandy loam to light sandy clay loam with 15 to 25 percent clay and a average in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon of less than 18 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 5/4, 4/4, or 7.5YR 6/4, 5/4 or 4/3 dry and 10YR or 7.5YR 5/4, 4/4, 4/3 or 3/3 moist.

Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  They formed from coarse textured granitic alluvium.  They occur at elevations of 50 to 150 feet in a climate with hot dry summers and cool moist foggy winters.   Mean annual rainfall is 18 to 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 61 to 63 degrees with average January temperature of 45 degrees F and average July temperature of 76 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."
