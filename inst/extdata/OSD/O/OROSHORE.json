  "OVERVIEW": "The Oroshore series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks.  Oroshore soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on metamorphic Sierra Nevada foothills.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches, (965 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F, (16 degrees C).",
