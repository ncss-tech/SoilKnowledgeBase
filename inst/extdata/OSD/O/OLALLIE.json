The drainage class should be reviewed also, because the water table is at the surface in spring; very poorly drained might be more appropriate.\nThe Olallie official series was used in an update project of some riparian areas southeast of Pendleton in Umatilla County, Oregon. In drainageways of dissected foothills in the Blue Mountains, flooding occurs in December through April as a result of snowmelt and seasonal springs and seeps when the water table is highest. Wide ranges in climate were populated in NASIS due to the nature of the lotic riparian areas along several km of a stream. Small areas of Olallie soils near seeps and springs may have an overstory of alder, ponderosa pine, and black cottonwood.\n6/2016--This official series description was updated according to SSR1 Technical Note 11--Content and Format of Official Series Descriptions (revised 12/2015).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
