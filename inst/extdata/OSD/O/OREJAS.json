    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Orejas soils are on plateaus, mesas and breaks at elevations of 5,500 to 7,800 feet.  Slopes range from 1 to 75 percent. These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium and eolian material derived from basalt.  The annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with a significant proportion resulting from intense late summer thunderstorms.  Mean annual temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F. Frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."
