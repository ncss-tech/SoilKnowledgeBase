  "OVERVIEW": "The Orejas series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium and eolian material derived from basalt. Orejas soils are on plateaus, mesas, and breaks and have slopes of 1 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

These soils formed in alluvium, colluvium and eolian material derived from basalt.  The annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches with a significant proportion resulting from intense late summer thunderstorms.  Mean annual temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F. Frost-free period is 110 to 140 days."
