Content of silt in the particle size control section is less than 20 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 2\nor 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 10YR, value\nof 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand or loamy sand in the A and E horizons.  The Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Some pedons have few to common mottles in\nshades of brown and red, and some pedons have grayish mottles in\nthe lower part.  Texture is sandy loam.  The BC horizon, where present, has colors like the Bt horizon.  It is loamy sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 5 to 8,\nand chroma of 1 to 8 with common to many mottles in shades of\nbrown, yellow, or gray.  It is sand or loamy sand."

Benndale, Dellrose, Dragston, Foreston, Harleston, Harpeth, Humphreys, Johns, Latonia, Rumford, and Sequatchie soils are\nsimilar series in other families.  Benndale and Harleston soils\nhave sola thicker than 60 inches and Bt horizons with more than 20 percent silt.  Dellroe, Harpeth, and Humphreys soils have Bt\nhorizons with more than 18 percent clay.  Dellrose, Dragston, and Harpeth soils have mixed mineralogy.  Foreston, Johns, Kalmia, Latonia, and Rumford soils have Ap horizons with color values of 4\nor higher, or the A horizon is less than 6 inches thick if its\ncolor value is less than 3.5.  Johns and Stallings soils have gray mottles in the upper Bt horizon.  Porters and Tusquitee soils have mixed mineralogy and mean annual soil temperatures of less than 59 degrees F.  Sequatchie soils have Bt horizons with loam or sandy\nloam textures and more than 20 percent silt."

Near the type location, the mean annual air\ntemperature is 64 degrees F., the average annual rainfall is 45 inches; and the frost-free growing season is about 219 days.  GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the similar Foreston\nand Johns series, plus the Chipley, Kenansville, Lumbee, and\nScranton series.  Chipley, and Scranton soils have a sandy\nparticle size control section.  Lumbee soils are poorly drained.  Kenansville soils have a sandy A horizon more than 20 inches\nthick."
