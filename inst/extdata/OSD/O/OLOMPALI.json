These soils are moist in all parts of the moisture control section from November through June. It is dry in some parts the rest of the time. Organic matter is more than 1 percent to a depth of 20 inches. Base saturation is 35 to 50 percent in some parts of the A horizon, and is 50 to 75 percent by sum of cations in all parts of the argillic horizon. Clay increase between the lower boundary of the A horizon and upper boundary of the Bt horizon is more than 15 percent absolute within 1 inch.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3 or 6/3 and moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 4/3.
