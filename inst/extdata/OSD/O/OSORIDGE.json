  "STATES": "NM",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Osoridge series consists of shallow to sandstone, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in slope alluvium over residuum derived from sandstone and shale of the Chinle Formation. Osoridge soils are on hills, ridges, and cuestas. Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
