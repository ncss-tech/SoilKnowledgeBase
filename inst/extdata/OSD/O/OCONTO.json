Millersburg soils have a sandy mantle that is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick. Omena soils are less than 61 cm (24 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon and are loamy throughout the series control section. Perote soils are more than 102 cm (40 inches) deep to sandy outwash."

These soils formed in loamy alluvial deposits over stratified calcareous sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 5.6 to 7.2 degrees C (42 to 45 degrees F)."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most gently sloping and sloping areas are used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. The moderately steep areas are generally used for pastureland or woodland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forests. Northern red oak, sugar maple, American basswood, and white ash are the dominant species."
