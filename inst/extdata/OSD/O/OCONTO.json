  "OVERVIEW": "The Oconto series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are moderately deep to calcareous sandy outwash. These soils formed in loamy alluvial deposits over sandy outwash that is stratified in some pedons. They are on outwash plains, glacial lake basins, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
