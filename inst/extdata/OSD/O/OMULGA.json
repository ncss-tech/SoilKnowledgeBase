  "OVERVIEW": "The Omulga series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess, colluvium, or old alluvium, and in most areas by underlying lacustrine sediments. These soils are on valley fill terraces from valley fills in abandoned preglacial drainage systems in the Allegheny Plateau. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow in the fragipan. Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F near the type location.",

Some pedons have an A horizon, 2 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches) thick, that has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2, and an E horizon, 8 to 20 cm thick, that has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. The A and E horizons are very strongly acid to moderately acid, but range to neutral where limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to extremely acid. Some pedons have a Btx horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to extremely acid. In some cases, B't or BC horizons occur and have colors and textures similar to the Btx horizon. These horizons are very strongly acid to moderately acid. Btx horizons extending below a depth of 40 inches may range to clay loam.\nThe 2Btx horizon has hue of 7.5 YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to extremely acid.

The 2B't horizon is typically silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay. The 2BC and 2C horizons are often stratified and range from sandy loam to clay. They commonly are very strongly acid to moderately acid but range to neutral in thick layers of silty clay and clay.\nIn pedons that have a 2B horizon at a depth of less than 24 inches, a 3B or 3C horizon commonly is identified at the contact with underlying stratified materials."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Apalona, Ava, Bedford, Boston, Cincinnati, Fountainville, Grantsburg, Hildebrecht, Hosmer, Lawrenceville, Nicholson, Otwell, Otwood, Solsberry, Weisburg, and Zanesville series. A similar soil is the Monongahela series. Apalona soils have primarily channers that are non-water-worked sandstone and siltstone below the lithologic discontinuity. Ava soils have bisequal soil development. Bedford soils have redder hue and higher clay content in the lower control section. Boston soils typically have limestone bedrock at 50 to 70 inches. Cincinnati soils have mixed coarse fragments from glacial till in the lower part of the solum. Fountainville, Nicholson, Otwood and Weisburg soils formed partly in residuum from bedrock and do not have stratification in the lower part. In addition, Weisburg soils have some coarse fragments of mixed lithology from glacial till. Grantsburg and Hosmer soils formed in loess, do not have stratification in the lower part of the solum, and do not contain coarse fragments. Hildebrecht soils have fragments of chert in the lower part of the solum. Lawrenceville soils have a more mottled fragipan and do not have silty coatings in the upper part of the fragipan. Otwell soils have stratified materials at depths of less than 40 inches and typically are less acid in the B and C horizons. Sollsberry and Zanesville soils contain sandstone channers in the lower solum. Monongahela soils contain more sand in the control section and have a lower base saturation at 30 inches below the top of the fragipan."
