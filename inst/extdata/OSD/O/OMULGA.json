  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 115 to 230 cm. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 45 to 90 cm. Volume of rock fragments, generally water-worn gravel, ranges up to 5 percent above the fragipan, up to 10 percent in the Btx, or B't horizons, where present, and up to 15 percent in the 2Btx, 2B't, 2BC, and 2C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have an A horizon, 2 to 10 cm (1 to 4 inches) thick, that has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2, and an E horizon, 8 to 20 cm thick, that has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. The A and E horizons are very strongly acid to moderately acid, but range to neutral where limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to extremely acid. Some pedons have a Btx horizon that has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to extremely acid. In some cases, B't or BC horizons occur and have colors and textures similar to the Btx horizon. These horizons are very strongly acid to moderately acid. Btx horizons extending below a depth of 40 inches may range to clay loam.\nThe 2Btx horizon has hue of 7.5 YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is strongly acid to extremely acid. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam or loam.\nThe 2B't, 2BC, and 2C horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6. The 2B't horizon is typically silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay. The 2BC and 2C horizons are often stratified and range from sandy loam to clay. They commonly are very strongly acid to moderately acid but range to neutral in thick layers of silty clay and clay.\nIn pedons that have a 2B horizon at a depth of less than 24 inches, a 3B or 3C horizon commonly is identified at the contact with underlying stratified materials."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Apalona, Ava, Bedford, Boston, Cincinnati, Fountainville, Grantsburg, Hildebrecht, Hosmer, Lawrenceville, Nicholson, Otwell, Otwood, Solsberry, Weisburg, and Zanesville series. A similar soil is the Monongahela series. Apalona soils have primarily channers that are non-water-worked sandstone and siltstone below the lithologic discontinuity. Ava soils have bisequal soil development. Bedford soils have redder hue and higher clay content in the lower control section. Boston soils typically have limestone bedrock at 50 to 70 inches. Cincinnati soils have mixed coarse fragments from glacial till in the lower part of the solum. Fountainville, Nicholson, Otwood and Weisburg soils formed partly in residuum from bedrock and do not have stratification in the lower part. In addition, Weisburg soils have some coarse fragments of mixed lithology from glacial till. Grantsburg and Hosmer soils formed in loess, do not have stratification in the lower part of the solum, and do not contain coarse fragments. Hildebrecht soils have fragments of chert in the lower part of the solum. Lawrenceville soils have a more mottled fragipan and do not have silty coatings in the upper part of the fragipan. Otwell soils have stratified materials at depths of less than 40 inches and typically are less acid in the B and C horizons. Sollsberry and Zanesville soils contain sandstone channers in the lower solum. Monongahela soils contain more sand in the control section and have a lower base saturation at 30 inches below the top of the fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Omulga soils are in valley fills in an abandoned preglacial drainage system of the Allegheny Plateau. Slope gradients are 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in loess, colluvium or old alluvium and in most areas by underlying lacustrine sediments. The loess mantle ranges up to 24 inches in thickness. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 38 to 43 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 52 to 56 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Allegheny, Doles, Gallia, Tygart, Vincent and Wyatt soils. Allegheny, Gallia, Vincent and Wyatt soils are on similar landscape positions. Allegheny and Gallia soils are fine-loamy and Wyatt and Vincent soils are fine. Doles soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on nearly level areas. Tygart soils are nearly level, somewhat poorly drained, and have more clay."

The study resulted in recorrelation of map units in 16 counties.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - 0 to 38 cm (Ap and BA horizons);\nargillic horizon - 38 to 201 cm (Bt1 through 2B't3 horizons);\nfragipan  76 to 109 cm (2Btx horizon);\nredoximorphic features  51 to 201 cm;\nlithologic discontinuity at a depth of 76 inches (top of 2Btx horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data from the Ohio State University on SC-10, the typical pedon, is available. Other data from the same source includes AT-6, BT-8, JK-4, JK-13, JK23, MN-15, PK-4, PK-5, PK-6, and PK-7.\nRevised: 01/2001-AR, DRM; 07/2007-GMG, NHM, DHK; 11/2009-DHK\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
