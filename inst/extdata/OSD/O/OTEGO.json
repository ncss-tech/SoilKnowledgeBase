Consistence is friable or very friable.\nIn some pedons a thin E horizon is present with hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or fine sandy loam. Structure is granular, platy, or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Iron depletions are present in some part between a depth of 12 to 24 inches with chroma of 2 or less. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse, subangular blocky or weak very coarse prismatic. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. In some pedons thin strata of fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand are below 40 inches. Structure is weak, coarse or very coarse, subangular blocky, or is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam. In some pedons thin strata of fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand are below 40 inches. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe 2C horizon, if present, is massive or single grained with hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8, or it is multicolored. Texture ranges from loam to very gravelly loamy sand and, in some pedons, is stratified. Consistence is loose to friable, and non-sticky and non-plastic."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nArkaqua, Bash, Basher, Codorus, Cornish, Hamplain, Lovewell, Pootatuck, Philo, and Rowland series are similar soils in related families. Arkaqua, Codorus, and Rowland soils have fine-loamy particle size control sections. Cornish and Lovewell soils are frigid. Bash, Basher, Pootatuck, and Philo soils have coarse-loamy particle size control sections. Hamplain soils do not have low chroma mottles within 24 inches of the soil surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Otego soils formed in post-glacial alluvium derived mainly from regolith containing sandstone, siltstone, and shale and are on flood plain steps on flood plains near till plateaus and glacial outwash terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 45 inches, and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 105 to 198 days. Elevation ranges from 570 to 1300 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bath, Chenango, Hamplain, Mardin, Scio, Trestle, Tunkhannock, Unadilla, Valois, Wakeville and Wayland soils. Otego soils are the moderately well drained member of a drainage sequence that includes the well drained Hamplain soils, the somewhat poorly drained Wakeville soils, and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Wayland soils. Well drained and somewhat excessively drained Chenango and Tunkhannock soils are on nearby glacial outwash terraces. Unadilla and Scio soils are on adjacent higher lacustrine or old alluvial terraces and plains. Well drained Trestle soils are on adjacent floodplain areas that are gravelly in the subsoil and substratum. Bath, Mardin, and Valois soils are on nearby till uplands."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Moderately well drained. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Permeability is moderate in the solum and upper substratum, and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower substratum. Depth to an\nintermittent apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 1.5 to 2.0 feet from December to April in normal years. Otego soils are subject to frequent flooding."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are cleared and are used for growing corn for silage, small grains, hay, and pasture. A few areas have reverted to woodland or brush. Native vegetation is sugar maple, white ash, and willows. Brushy areas often contain dogwoods, willows, spirea, Hawthorne (thorn apple), and poplar."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series is the low base saturation equivalent of the Teel series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 13 inches (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 35 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nAquic subgroup - evidenced by low chroma mottles within 24 inches of the soil surface (Bw1 horizon) Udic moisture regime.\nThis revision reflects a change in taxonomic classification from Coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Fluvaquentic Dystrochrepts to Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Dystrudepts due to updates contained in the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified.\nSoils mapped as Chagrin silt loam, classified as Fine- loamy, mixed, mesic Dystric Fluventic Eutrochrepts, and as Lobdell silt loam, classified as Fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Fluventic Eutrochrepts in the Soil Survey of Ashtabula County, Ohio, published 1973, were correlated to the Otego series during the modernization project of that survey.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Cornell University Soil Survey Laboratory base saturation data is available for this pedon (84-29), and other pedons from Otsego County, New York. Characterization data is available from Ashtabula County, Ohio. Refer to pedon AB-127, sample numbers 26862 to 26870; samples analyzed by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
