  "OVERVIEW": "The Otego series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in post-glacial alluvium derived mainly from regolith containing sandstone, siltstone, and shale and are on flood plain steps on flood plains near till plateaus and glacial outwash terraces. Permeability is moderate in the solum and upper substratum, and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches.",

Arkaqua, Codorus, and Rowland soils have fine-loamy particle size control sections. Cornish and Lovewell soils are frigid. Bash, Basher, Pootatuck, and Philo soils have coarse-loamy particle size control sections. Hamplain soils do not have low chroma mottles within 24 inches of the soil surface."

Otego soils are the moderately well drained member of a drainage sequence that includes the well drained Hamplain soils, the somewhat poorly drained Wakeville soils, and the poorly drained and very poorly drained Wayland soils. Well drained and somewhat excessively drained Chenango and Tunkhannock soils are on nearby glacial outwash terraces. Unadilla and Scio soils are on adjacent higher lacustrine or old alluvial terraces and plains. Well drained Trestle soils are on adjacent floodplain areas that are gravelly in the subsoil and substratum. Bath, Mardin, and Valois soils are on nearby till uplands."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This series is the low base saturation equivalent of the Teel series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 13 inches (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 35 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\nAquic subgroup - evidenced by low chroma mottles within 24 inches of the soil surface (Bw1 horizon) Udic moisture regime.\nThis revision reflects a change in taxonomic classification from Coarse-silty, mixed, mesic Fluvaquentic Dystrochrepts to Coarse-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Fluvaquentic Dystrudepts due to updates contained in the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified.\nSoils mapped as Chagrin silt loam, classified as Fine- loamy, mixed, mesic Dystric Fluventic Eutrochrepts, and as Lobdell silt loam, classified as Fine-loamy, mixed, mesic Fluventic Eutrochrepts in the Soil Survey of Ashtabula County, Ohio, published 1973, were correlated to the Otego series during the modernization project of that survey.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Cornell University Soil Survey Laboratory base saturation data is available for this pedon (84-29), and other pedons from Otsego County, New York. Characterization data is available from Ashtabula County, Ohio. Refer to pedon AB-127, sample numbers 26862 to 26870; samples analyzed by the Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, Ohio.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
