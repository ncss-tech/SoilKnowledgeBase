  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is commonly 26 to 35 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 32 inches.  Depth to accumulations of calcium carbonate is typically 10 to 31 inches.  The soil has less than 10 percent rock fragments throughout.  The moisture control section is usually moist in some or all parts in March through June.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is commonly clay loam and less commonly loam.  It has 20 to 35 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent fine and coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is typically part of the argillic horizon. It is clay loam or loam.  It has 3 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is commonly loam or clay loam and less commonly silt loam or fine sandy loam.  It has 4 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon consists of sandy or silty shale, or interbedded shale and sandstone.  In a few pedons it is primarily sandstone. The bedrock may be strongly effervescent throughout, inconsistently effervescent in various layers, or noneffervescent."

In addition, Arnor soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments.  Bigbow soils have buried horizons at depths of less than 40 inches.  Bosonoak soils occur above elevations of 6500 feet and receive most of their precipitation between July and October.  Carri, Celavar, Evpark, Nyjack and Ribera soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Celacy soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section during the 120 days following the winter solstice.  Elwop soils have more than 35 percent fine sand and coarser sand in the particle-size control section.  Gateson soils have an E&B horizon.  Toluca soils have secondary calcium carbonate accumulations at 10 inches or less and the base of the argillic horizon is less than 15 inches.  Olnest soils have a frost-free period of more than 135 days.  Rockybutte soils are moderately deep to porcellanite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oldwolf soils are on fan remnants, plateaus, ridges and hills.  They formed in alluvium over residuum derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow in March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
