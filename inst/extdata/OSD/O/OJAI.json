  "OVERVIEW": "The Ojai series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from material weathering from mostly sandstone or related sedimentary rocks.  Ojai soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 600 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
