  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Occoquan Series are deep, somewhat excessively drained to well drained soils with moderate to rapid permeability.  They formed in residuum that weathered from granite gneiss and schist of the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The poorly drained Baile, the somewhat poorly drained Hoadly and the moderately well to well drained Meadowville soils are on lower positions in the landscape and are subject to seepage and runoff from the soils on adjacent higher landscape positions.  The Fairfax soil is developed partly in coastal plains sediments and partly in residuum from mica schist and gneiss and has a higher clay content in the control section.  The Glenelg soil developed in mica schist and has a thicker solum."
