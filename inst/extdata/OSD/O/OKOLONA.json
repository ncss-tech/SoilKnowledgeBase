  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The combined thickness of the A and Bw horizon ranges from 40 to more than 65 inches.  Depth to chalk ranges from 48 to more than 100 inches.  Intersecting slickensides are at a depth ranging from 15 to 33 inches below the surface.  Cycles of micro-lows and micro-highs are repeated about every 7 to 20 feet.  Thickness of horizons with a color value of less than 3.5 and chroma of 1.5 or more ranges from 16 to 25 inches in the center of the micro-lows and from 8 to 14 inches in the center of the micro-highs.  The extremes of amplitude of waviness of the boundary between the A and Bw horizons vary from 8 to 33 inches from the center of the micro-highs to the center of the micro-lows.\nThe A horizon has in the upper 12 inches of more than half of each pedon a matrix in hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3; other colors, if present, have hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2; and hue of 2.5Y and 5Y, with value of 4, and chroma of 2.  Texture is silty clay or clay.  Some pedons have a silty clay loam Ap horizon.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw and C horizons have hue 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4; or they are mottled in shades of brown and gray.  Texture of the Bw and C horizons is silty clay or clay.  The particle size control section, from 10- to 40-inches, has 40 to 55 percent clay.  Brown and black concretions range from few to common.  The Bw and C horizons are neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Closely related soils are the Beaumont, Brooksville, Burleson, Eutaw, Heiden, Houston, Houston Black, Kipling, and Lela series.  The Beaumont and Eutaw soils are grayer and have a dominant chroma of less than 1.5 throughout the control section.  Brooksville soils have distinct or prominent mottles in shades of red and brown within 20 inches of the surface and are more acid in the upper part of the soil.  Burleson, Heiden, and Houston Black soils have an ustic moisture regime.  Houston soils have more than 60 percent clay and are less silty in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  Kipling soils have a yellowish brown Bt horizon mottled with gray.  Lela soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Okolona soils are on uplands in the Blackland Prairie Major Land Resource Area.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  These are nearly level to gently sloping soils that formed in calcareous clayey material, which is underlain by marly clay and chalk.  The climate is warm and humid.  Average annual precipitation is about 48 inches and average annual temperature is about 63 degrees Fahrenheit near the type location."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brooksville and Kipling soils listed in the competing series and the Binnsville, Demopolis, Griffith, and Sumter series.  Somewhat poorly drained Brooksville and Kipling soils are on similar landscape positions as the Okolona soils.  Well drained Binnsville and Demopolis soils, which have a solum less than 20 inches thick over chalk, commonly are in slightly higher positions on ridgetops and hillsides.  Well drained Griffith soils, which have amplitude of waviness between the A and Bw horizons of 6 to 10 inches and have an A horizon 24 to 48 inches thick, are on flood plains.  Well drained Sumter soils, which have a solum 20 to 40 inches thick and do not have intersecting slickensides, are mainly in small areas on ridges and hillsides."
