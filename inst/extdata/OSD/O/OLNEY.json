  "OVERVIEW": "The Olney series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits.  Olney soils are on plains, hills, and ridges in the Upper Arkansas Valley Rolling Plains MLRA 69.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 13 inches (330 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is 52 degrees F. (11 degrees C.)",
