Halawa soils have silt loam texture in the upper part of the B horizon and thin nearly continuous clay films in the argillic horizon. Honolua soils have 5YR or 7.5YR hue in the argillic horizon. Kalae soils have an ochric epipedon and silt loam texture in the lower part of the B horizon. Leilehua soils have thin patchy clay films throughout the argillic horizon.  Makawao soils have 5YR or yellower hue and patchy clay films in the argillic horizon.  Paaloa soils have nearly continuous moderately thick clay films in the upper part of the argillic horizon and thin continuous clay films in the lower part."

The soils formed in residuum from basic igneous material.  Annual rainfall is 1524 to 2540 millimeters (60 to 100 inches) and is fairly well distributed throughout the year.  The mean annual temperature is about 18 degrees C. (65 degrees F.); average January temperature is about 17 degrees C. (63 degrees F.); and the average July temperature is about 19 degrees C.

Naiwa soils do not have an argillic horizon and have silt loam or loam texture in the B horizon."
