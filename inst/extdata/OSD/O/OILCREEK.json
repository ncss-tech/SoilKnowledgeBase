  "OVERVIEW": "The Oilcreek series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed on mountain sideslopes.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mudstone, sandstone, and siltstone.  Slope ranges from 15 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1285 millimeters Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
