The climate is humid, characterized by cool, foggy summers and cool wet winters. Mean precipitation is 1040 to 1530 millimeters (41 to 60 inches).  The mean annual air temperature is 9 to 12 degrees C (49 to 54 degrees F).  The mean January temperature is about 8 degrees C.  The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C.
