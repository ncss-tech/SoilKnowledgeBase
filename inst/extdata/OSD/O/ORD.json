  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 43 centimeters (0 to 17 inches) (Ak1 and Ak2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 12 inches) (Ak1 horizon)\nAquic soil conditions: 43 to 200 centimeters (17 to 79 inches)\n3/2009 RRH: Ord soils were formerly classified as coarse-loamy, mixed, mesic Fluvaquentic Haplustolls and were included in the Wann series. About half of the pedons of the Ord soils in the sandhills have the aeric subgroup and the rest have the typic subgroup. About 72 percent of the Ord soils in the sandhills have depths to the sandy material less than 102 centimeters (40 inches) and about 28 percent have depths more than 102 centimeters (40 inches).\n3/2009 RRH: Ord soils were first mapped on floodplains of valleys and most are outside of MLRA 65. The old type location in Logan County, Nebraska, was on a floodplain along the South Loup River between MLRA 65 and MLRA 71. It may be a stream terrace as of present because of down cutting of the river. The Ord soils may be better represented by the Wann series on floodplains of valleys and by the Ovina series on stream terraces of valleys.\n3/2009 RRH: Reformatted the Ord OSD using Central Great Plains MLRA Office (MO5) Instruction No. 430-381, Official Series Descriptions. All sections were revised, including the typical pedon to reflect the original pedon description.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data is available from the National Soil Survey Center, Soil Survey Laboratory for pedon 79NE089005 which is the type location for the series. Pedons 08NE005043 and 08NE005042 have been sampled for the SSL in Arthur County, Nebraska.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
