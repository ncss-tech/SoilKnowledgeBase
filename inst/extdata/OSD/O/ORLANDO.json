  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Texture is uniform sand or fine sand to 80 inches of more deep except for a few pedons that have loamy sand or fine sandy loam lamellae below 60 inches.  Silt plus clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section is less than 12 percent.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid throughout except where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or less and chroma of 2 or less.\nThe A/C horizon, where present, is mixed color in hues 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 or less.  Small pockets, lenses or streaks of gray to white uncoated sand grains are in this horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  In some pedons, there are few to common, fine to coarse mottles or splotches of gray to white uncoated sand but they are not indicative or wetness.  A few distinct mottles in shades of brown to yellow, and lamellae are in the lower part of this horizon in some pedons."

All of the associated soils lack an umbric epipedon.  Arrendondo and Millhopper soils have argillic horizons between depths of 40 to 80 inches and Millhopper soils are not as well drained.  Kendrick soils have argillic horizons between depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Lake soils have 5 to 10 percent silt plus clay in the control section.  Gainesville soils have 5 to 15 percent silt plus clay in the control section.  Astatula and Candler soils have less than 5 percent silt plus clay in the control section.  In addition, Candler soils have thin, discontinuous laminae below depths of 40 inches in the C horizon.  Immokalee and Myakka soils are poorly drained and have spodic horizons."
