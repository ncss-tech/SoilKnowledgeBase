    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Similar series include Gladewater, Nahatche, Navasota, and Sandow soils.   Gladewater and Navasota soils are clayey throughout, and have aquic conditions within 20 inches of the surface.  Nahatche soils have aquic conditions within 20 inches of the surface, and do not have cambic horizons.  Sandow soils do not have gypsum in the control section and have loamy surface textures."
