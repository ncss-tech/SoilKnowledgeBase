    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist but are dry between 8 and 24 inches for 30 to 45 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 46 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F with an O horizon. Solum thickness and depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches. The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, of which 15 to 25 percent are gravel and 20 to 35 percent are cobbles and stones. The control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay It has a moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.00 g/cubic centimeter. Andic soil properties are present throughout the solum. Acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 3 to 5 percent. Phosphate retention is 75 to 100. Glass content is 30 to 60 percent. The dry 15 bar water content is 15 to 20 percent throughout the solum. Acid oxalate silica is 2 to 3 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry and value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry. It is very cobbly medial sandy loam or very cobbly medial loam. It is moderately acid or slightly acid."

These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from andesite and volcanic ash. Elevation is 4,800 to 6,600 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F. The frost-free period is less than 100 days. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent."
