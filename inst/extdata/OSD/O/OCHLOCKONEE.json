  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A or Ap horizon and is very strongly acid or strongly acid in horizons below the A.  Buried soil horizons, present in most pedons below a depth of 25 inches, have the same range in color and texture as the A horizon.  Some pedons have gravelly strata below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loam, or silt loam.\nThe C and C' horizons have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Thin strata of finer or coarser textured materials are in most pedons.  Some pedons have mottles of brown, yellow, and gray below a depth of 20 inches.  Content of mica flakes ranges from none to common."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no series in the same family. Competing series in closely similar families are the Cartecay, Dela, Hatliff, Iuka, Madill, Oklared, Robinsonville, Toccoa, Tribbey, and Tullahassee series.  The Cartecay, Tribbey, and Tullahassee soils are nonacid, have mixed mineralogy, and have low chroma mottles within 20 inches of the surface.  The Dela soils are nonacid.  Hatliff soils are nonacid and have low chroma mottles within 20 inches of the surface.  Iuka soils have low chroma mottles within 20 inches of the surface.  The Madill, Oklared, Robinsonville, and Toccoa soils are nonacid and have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The climate is warm and humid.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 56 to 62 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 48 inches to 56 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Iuka series on lower positions and the Bibb, Cahaba, Eunola, Kalmia, and Mantachie series.  The poorly drained Bibb series is in lower positions of stream flood plains.  The Cahaba, Eunola, and Kalmia soils are on adjacent stream terraces and are fine-loamy.  The somewhat poorly drained Mantachie soils are in lower positions of stream flood plains and are fine-loamy."
