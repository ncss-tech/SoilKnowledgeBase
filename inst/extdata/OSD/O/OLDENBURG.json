The somewhat poorly drained Holton soils are in channels and lower lying flood-plain steps. The well drained Wirt soils are on natural levees adjacent to stream channels and on higher lying flood-plain steps. The well drained Bonnell and Hickory soils are on shoulders and backslopes. The well drained Cincinnati and moderately well drained Nabb soils are dominantly on summits and shoulders."

The potential for surface water runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the subsoil and moderately high or high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the subsoil and moderate or moderately rapid in the underlying material. These soils are subject to occasional to frequent periods of flooding."
