Laird soils have the loamy, lacustrine material at depths of 5 to 20 inches, and are usually on slightly lower, concave landscape positions.\nValent soils are excessively drained, sandy throughout the series control section, and are on hummocky dunes."

The iron masses in these soils are not due to present soil-water conditions.  The seasonal high water table is currently at depths below 10 feet.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  National Soil Survey Laboratory data available for pedon S88NE-057-21 (sampled as Laird).\nModified format by LRM in 10/2005 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
