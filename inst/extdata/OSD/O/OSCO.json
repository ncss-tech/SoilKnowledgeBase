Ashdale soils formed in thinner loess, the lower part of the control section formed in residuum weathered from limestone, and limestone bedrock is at depths of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Broadwell, Dinsdale, Meadowbank, Mendota, Ogle, Parkway, Plano, Proctor, Richwood, Sidell, Tecumseh, and Toddville soils all have more than 7 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Douglas soils have till at 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). Elkhart soils have carbonates within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Elmont soils have a paralithic contact within 152 cm (60 inches). Gymer soils have a matrix hue of 5YR or 7.5YR in the lower half of the series control section. Healing soils formed in alluvium from limestone and have chert and sandstone fragments in the series control section. Lycurgus soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loamy sediments with 10 to 40 percent sand over loess. Malcolm soils have 12 to 18 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section.  Mickle soils formed in silty slope alluvium.  Ripon soils have limestone bedrock within 102 cm (40 inches). Sibley soils have mollic epipedons that range from 61 to 91 cm (24 to 36 inches thick). Tama soils do not have a zone of periodic saturation within a depth of 183 cm (6 feet). Wakenda soils are in a warmer temperature and a wetter moisture regime. Waupecan soils have Beta B horizons in sandy and gravelly outwash."

Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Osco soils formed in loess. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.8 to 12.2 degrees C (46 to 54 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 864 to 1016 (34 to 40 inches). Frost-free period ranges from 160 to 180 days. Elevation ranges from 168 to 305 meters (550 to 1000) feet above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Biggsville, Muscatune, Newvienna, Rozetta, Sable, and Tama soils. Biggsville soils are on similar positions closer to the river valley. The well drained Tama soils, somewhat poorly drained Muscatune soils, and poorly drained Sable soils in Illinois are in drainage sequences with the Osco soils. The Muscatune and Sable soils commonly are in less sloping positions. The moderately well drained Newvienna soils have thinner A horizons. The well drained Rozetta soils occupy similar landscape positions and have thinner A horizons and have E horizons. Osco soils are in a bio-sequence with the Newvienna soils and the Rozetta soils."
