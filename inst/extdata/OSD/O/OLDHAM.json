Seasonal high saturation occurs at depths of 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 1 foot) and typically occurs from October through June in normal years.  The upper 15 cm is not saturated for at least one month during the months of July to September. Most areas of Oldham soils have some type of artificial drainage."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: cumulic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 102 centimeters (40 inches) (Ap, Bg, Bkg, Bkgy horizons); Vertic features - a linear extensibility of more than 6 cm in the upper 100 cm.\nThe previous classification of this series was fine, smectitic, calcareous, frigid Cumulic Vertic Epiaquolls.  However, there was no data to support a perched saturation on this soil.\nThis soil competes with the Southam series based only on depth to saturation.  Additional studies are needed in the future to see if both series are needed, or if ponded and drained phases of one of these series would be appropriate."
