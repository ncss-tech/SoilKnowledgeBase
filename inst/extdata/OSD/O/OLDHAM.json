    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from 0 to 25 centimeters (0 to 10 inches). The particle size control section is silty clay loam or silty clay with an estimated clay content of 35 to 45 percent and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 61 to 152 centimeters (24 to 60 inches).\nThe Ap horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry; and chroma of 1 or less. It is silty clay loam or silty clay. It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry; and chroma of 1 or less. It is silty clay loam or silty clay. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkg and Bkgy horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 to 5 and 3 to 7 dry; and chroma of 2 or less. They are silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay. Silt loam is restricted to below depths of 102 centimeters (40 inches). They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons do not have a Bkg horizon. Typically the contain few to many accumulations of gypsum and other salts, or calcium carbonate.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2. Few to many, faint to prominent redoximorphic features are in the lower part of the Bkg and Cg horizons. The Cg horizon is silty clay loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a 2Cg horizon with glacial till between depths of 102 and 203 centimeters (40 and 80 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Oldham soils are mainly in flat upland depressions and basins of shallow lakes and ponds having plane or slightly concave surfaces. Slopes gradients range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in local clayey alluvium. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 485 to 735 millimeters (19 to 29 inches). Growing season is about 120 to 160 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 330 to 457 millimeters (13 to 18 inches); and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000. Elevation ranges from 305 to 649 meters (1000 to 2130 feet)."

Parnell and Southam soils are in similar positions in the landscape as the Oldham soils. The Parnell soils are leached of carbonate to a depth of more than 64 centimeters (25 inches). The Poinsett and Waubay soils are fine-silty and are on adjacent uplands."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is .15 to 1.5 centimeters (.06 to .6 inches) per hour. Seasonal high saturation occurs at depths of 0 to 30 centimeters (0 to 1 foot) and typically occurs from October through June in normal years.  The upper 15 cm is not saturated for at least one month during the months of July to September. Most areas of Oldham soils have some type of artificial drainage."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: cumulic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 102 centimeters (40 inches) (Ap, Bg, Bkg, Bkgy horizons); Vertic features - a linear extensibility of more than 6 cm in the upper 100 cm.\nThe previous classification of this series was fine, smectitic, calcareous, frigid Cumulic Vertic Epiaquolls.  However, there was no data to support a perched saturation on this soil.\nThis soil competes with the Southam series based only on depth to saturation.  Additional studies are needed in the future to see if both series are needed, or if ponded and drained phases of one of these series would be appropriate.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
