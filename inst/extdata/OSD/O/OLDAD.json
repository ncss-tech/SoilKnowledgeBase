  "OVERVIEW": "The Oldad series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over alluvium from granitoid, gneiss, diorite and limestone. Oldad soils are on sand sheets over fan remnants. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
