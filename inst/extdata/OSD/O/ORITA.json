  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have an overwash from one or two to 19 inches thick.  Solum thickness ranges from 26 to 60 inches.  The soil is somewhat stratified and calcareous throughout.  Most horizons are gravelly, but within the solum gravel ranges from none to about 55 percent by volume.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 75 degrees F., and the soil is usually dry.  An open to continuous but not closely fitted gravel pavement is at the surface.  The gravels have little to no desert varnish, but some have carbonate coatings.\nThe overwash and 2A horizon are similar.  They have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist.  The overwash ranges from loamy sand to fine sandy loam, and the 2A horizon is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. The surface horizon commonly has platy structure except that those of loamy sand may be single grained.  The lower part of the overwash and the 2A horizon may be massive.\nThe 2Bt horizon has 10YR through 5YR hue and tends to be redder than the overlying horizons.  It ranges from heavy fine sandy loam to clay loam, and contain between 18 and 30 percent clay.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.  All parts of the 2Bt horizon may contain some bodies and concretions of lime but they are greater in number and larger in the lower part, which commonly contains nodules and weak cementation.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, and value and chroma similar to the overlying horizons.  It ranges from sand to fine sandy loam.  Some gravels have carbonate coatings. Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Aco soils lack argillic horizons and contain less than 18 percent clay.  Adelanto soils have less than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Chuckawalla soils are very gravelly or very cobbly in the lower part of the B2t horizon.  Cornville, Dona Ana and Mohave soils have mean annual soil temperature of less than 72 degrees F."

The soils formed in somewhat stratified and gravelly alluvium derived from many kinds of rock.  The climate is arid.  Mean annual precipitation is about 3 to 5 inches.  The average January temperature is about 53 degrees F., the average July temperature is about 90 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 70 to, 73 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 270 to 360 days."
