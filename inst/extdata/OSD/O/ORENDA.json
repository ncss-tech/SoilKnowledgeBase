  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from about 24 to 50 inches. Depth to bedrock is from 5 to 15 feet. Rock fragments of angular vein quartz range from 0 to 15 percent throughout the soil. Content of partially weathered hornblende gneiss or hornblende schist fragments range from 0 to 25 percent throughout. Rock fragments do not average more than 35 percent in the particle-size control section. Mica flakes are few to common in the Bt and C horizons. Reaction is strongly acid through slightly acid, unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6 and chroma of 3 through 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8. High and low chroma parent material mottling is common in the lower B. It is clay or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8. High and low chroma parent material mottling is common in the lower B. It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay.\nThe C horizon is commonly multicolored in shades of red, yellow, brown, white and black. It is loam, silt loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam in the fine earth fraction."

Fauquier soils are more than 40 inches deep to Greenstone bedrock. Lenberg and Needmore soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock. Montalto soils formed from diabase or gabbro and have these rock fragments throughout the profile. Norton soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock and B horizon is 2.5YR or 10R. Peabody soils have soft bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Pisgah soils are developed in limestone residuum and the solum ranges to more than 60 inches. Poplimento soils solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches and they are developed in residuum of limestone and shale. Saucon soils are in Triassic Basins of the northern part of the Piedmont Plateau."

These soils developed in residuum from hornblende gneiss or hornblende schist and other mixed basic and acidic volcanogenic materials. Annual temperature ranges from about 53 to 57 degrees F. Annual precipitation ranged from about 39 to 43 inches."

The Minnieville soils have redder colors in their B horizons. The Spriggs soils have thinner sola and are shallower to bedrock. The Buckhall developed in materials that weathered from granite or granite gneiss and the Elioak in materials that weathered from quartz muscovite schist."
