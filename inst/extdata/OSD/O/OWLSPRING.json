  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Owlspring soils are on toeslopes of calderas and mesas. They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from Tertiary basalt and basaltic tuff. Slopes range from 1 to 10 percent. Elevation ranges from 8,500 to 9,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 22 inches with more than 50 percent falling as snow from winter storms. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 42 degrees F. The average frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Sonsela, Todacheene, Viewpoint, and Washpass soils. Sonsela soils are loamy-skeletal, lack mollic epipedons, and occur on south-facing backslopes. Todacheene soils are fine-loamy, well drained, and occur on adjacent footslopes.  Viewpoint soils are loamy, shallow to basalt, and occur on adjacent shoulders and knolls. Washpass soils are coarse-loamy, have thin mollic epipedons, and occur on north-facing slopes in a cryic soil temperature regime."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained; medium runoff; moderately slow permeability.  These soils have frequent, very brief periods of flooding between April and September. This flooding is in response to snowmelt in spring and heavy rainfall in summer following prolonged, high-intensity convective thunderstorms."

The particle-size control section of the typifying pedon at the type location, was wet sieved to determine percent of size fraction larger than very fine sand (less than 0.1 mm). The weighted average of the control section was 4 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nUpdated and revised for the correlation of Ft.
