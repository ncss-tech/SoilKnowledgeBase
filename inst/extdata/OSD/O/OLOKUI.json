The ironstone sheet ranges in thickness from 1/8 to 2 inches.  On slopes greater than 15 Percent, the ironstone sheet is commonly weakly developed.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 58 degrees F.\nThe 01 horizon ranges in hue from 10YR to 5YR.\nThe A1g and A2g horizons have a range in hue from 10YR to 5Y."

The soils formed in residuum from basic igneous rock with possible volcanic ash influence in the upper part.  Annual rainfall is 75 to 150 inches.  Fog and cloud cover are present during moist days throughout the year.  The average January temperature is about 54 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 64 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 58 degrees F."
