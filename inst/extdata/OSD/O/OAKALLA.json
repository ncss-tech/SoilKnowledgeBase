  "OVERVIEW": "The Oakalla series consists of soils that are very deep. These well drained soils formed in loamy alluvium derived from limestone of Cretaceous age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping on flood plains on perennial streams in river valleys. They are subject to flooding by overflow from streams for short periods after heavy rains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 19 degrees C (67 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 in).",

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are being used for farmland, pastureland, and rangeland. The areas farmed are mainly in sorghums and small grains. Some areas are used for improves pastures. The climax plant community is a semi-wooded flood plain that has trees shading as much as 15 percent of the area along the water courses. Native trees are scattered elm, pecan, hackberry, and cottonwood.  Away from the water courses, there are tall and mid grasses with occasional trees.  The dominant plants are big bluestem, little bluestem, and vine mesquite. Other grasses include yellow Indiangrass, eastern gamagrass, switchgrass, southwestern bristlegrass, Canada wildrye, purple tridens, broadleaf uniola, Scribners panicum, plains lovegrass, Texas wintergrass, sideoats grama, cane bluestem and buffalograss. Woody plants include pecan, walnut, oaks, elms, mulberry, sycamore, wafer ash, button willow, wild grape, hackberry, greenbriar, honeysuckle, peppervine, and poison ivy or poison oak. Forbs include Maximilian sunflower, bushsunflower, Engelmann daisy, blood ragweed, and yellow neptunia.  With heavy stocking rates the site could potentially deteriorate to a plant population of meadow dropseed, vine-mesquite, silver bluestem, sideoats grama, buffalograss, and mesquite. If this destructive grazing practice is continued the site will deteriorate to an understory plant community of prickly pear, buffalograss, threeawn, Texas wintergrass, red grama, and annual weeds and grasses with a dense overstory of oak, elm, mesquite, and hackberry. Extensive shading by trees and thicket-forming plants is a major management problem on this site."
