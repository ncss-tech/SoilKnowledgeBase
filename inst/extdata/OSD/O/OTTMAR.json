These soils are continuously dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches from about May 1 to October 1, unless irrigated.  Depth to secondary lime ranges from 16 to 36 inches.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and 2 or 3 moist.  It has medium granular or coarse platy structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 dry.  It has coarse prismatic or subangular blocky structure.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It has medium or strong subangular blocky structure or is massive and finely laminated.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 2 to 10 percent."

Very deep phases occur at elevations of 350 to 500 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.  They formed in loess mixed with alluvium in the upper part and in alluvium and residuum from Ringold siltstone and shale in the lower part.  These soils are over semi-consolidated siltstone and shale sediments of the Ringold Formation.  These soils are in an arid climate that borders on xeric with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 180 to 200 days."

Wiehl soils are coarse-loamy and are moderately deep to a semi-consolidated sandstone paralithic contact. Warden soils are coarse-silty, very deep and lack a paralithic contact.  Sagehill soils are very deep, coarse-loamy and lack a paralithic contact. Taunton soils have a duripan at 20 to 40 inches."
