Depth to the top of the fragipan ranges from 25 to 64 cm (10 to 25 in). Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume in the mineral soil above the fragipan, from 15 to 50 percent in the fragipan, and from 15 to 60 percent in the substratum. Redoximorphic features are present beginning at a depth of 20 to 36 cm (8 to 14 in). Reaction is very strongly acid through slightly acid in the mineral solum, unless limed, and strongly acid through slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe E horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam or silt loam. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe Eg horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the fine earth fraction is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, clay loam or silty clay loam. Structure is coarse or very coarse prismatic with platy, blocky, or massive interiors. Consistence is firm or very firm. Common or many redoximorphic masses are present. Prism streaks have low chroma interiors and high chroma edges.\nThe C or Cd horizons are massive, or have platy or prismatic structure. Color and texture is similar to the Bx horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Camroden and Norchip series. Camroden soils are dominated by shale rock fragments and occur in areas having higher rainfall and at slightly lower elevations. Norchip soils are poorly drained and are less acid in the Bx and C horizons.\nThe Erie, Marcy, Napoli, Onteora, Trussel, and Volusia series are similar soils in related families. Onteora soils have a coarse-loamy particle size control section and have hues redder than 7.5YR in the fragipan and substratum. Erie and Volusia soils have a mesic temperature regime. Marcy soils have chroma of 2 or less in 60 percent or more of the matrix in the upper 30 in. Trussel soils formed in colluvium derived from residual soil material, are at higher elevations, have more angular rock fragments, and have lower bulk density in the fragipan. The Napoli soils have an argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ontusia soils are on concave landforms and depressions on summits and the lower part of hillsides in the uplands of glaciated dissected plateaus. Due to frigid soil temperatures, these soils occur on landscapes and landforms at higher elevations in the MLRA. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The soils developed in till derived from brownish or gray colored sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F).  Annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm (32 to 70 in) and the frost free days range from 110 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 1100 m (1394 to 3608 ft) above sea level."

Moderately deep, well drained Mongaup soils, and shallow, somewhat excessively drained and well drained Hawksnest soils are closely associated on nearby landforms where the soil mantle is thinner over bedrock. The somewhat poorly drained and moderately deep Gretor soils can occur on nearby landforms."

The limited data available is split between active and superactive.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 20 cm (8 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 20 to 41 cm (8 to 16 in) (Bw and Eg horizons).\n3. Fragipan - the zone from 41 to 145 cm (16 to 57 in) (Bx1, Bx2, and Bx3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available for this pedon from the Cornell University Soil Survey Laboratory and the NSSC Soil Characterization Database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
