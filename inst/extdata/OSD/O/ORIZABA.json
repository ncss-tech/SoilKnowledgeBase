  "OVERVIEW": "The Orizaba series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. The Orizaba soils are on alluvial flats, lake plains, floodplains and beach plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent The mean annual precipitation is about 150 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
