  "OVERVIEW": "The Oceano series consists of deep, excessively drained soils that formed in material weathered from sandy eolian deposits.  Oceano soils are on rolling dune-like topography, near the ocean and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 58 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F., and usually the temperature is not below 47 degrees F.  at any time.  Soil between the depths of about 12 and 35 inches usually is dry all of the time from late April or May until November and usually is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  The soil is sand or loamy sand throughout and rock fragments are lacking.  It is mostly moderately acid but the range is slightly to strongly acid.  There is no clear reaction trend with depth except that the uppermost and lowermost horizons commonly are less acid.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, brown, light brownish gray, pale brown or light yellowish brown.  In uncultivated soils the organic matter content ranges from 2 to 4 percent in the uppermost 2 to 4 inches, but decreases with depth and the average for the upper 10 inches is about 1/2 to 1 percent.\nLower horizons are either B or C horizon.  They are light gray or light yellowish brown to brown with hue 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 3 or 4.  A few weak and somewhat discontinuous lamellae 1/8 to 1/2 inch thick are present.  The first lamellae occur at a depth of about 25 to 32 inches and continue to a depth of about 60 to 90 inches.  They have stronger chroma, redder hue of lower value, or a combination of these features, compared to the matrix color.  The matrix is soft or loose and the lamellae are slightly hard or hard, Some of the lamellae are slightly brittle.  Lamellae have few to common very thin or thin clay bridges between mineral grains.  In some pedons are lamellae 1/4 to 3/4 inches thick below 40 inches."

Arnold soils have a paralithic contact of soft sandstone and lack lamellae.  Baywood soils have mollic epipedons.  Corralitos and Tujunga soils are stratified and lack lamellae.  Delhi soils are neutral and lack lamellae.  Garey soils have argillic horizons made up of lamellae.  Marina soils have B horizons with slightly hard matrix and hard lamellae.  Metz soils are alkaline and are not sandy in all parts of the 10- to 40-inch section.  Tangair soils are saturated within 40 inches of the surface part of the year."
