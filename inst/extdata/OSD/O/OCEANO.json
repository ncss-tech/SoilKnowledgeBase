  "OVERVIEW": "The Oceano series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in material from old eolian deposits. Oceano soils are on sand dunes near the ocean and have slopes of 0 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
