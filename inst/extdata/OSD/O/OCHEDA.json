  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ocheda series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 40 to 60 inch thick mantle of clayey glacial lacustrine sediments and in underlying loamy calcareous glacial till on ground moraines or lake plains. These soils have slow or moderately slow permeability. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to carbonates ranges from18 to 44 inches. Thickness of the lacustrine mantle over glacial till ranges from 40 to 60 inches. The upper sediment typically lacks rock fragments but in some pedons it contains up to 5 percent by volume of rock fragments. The glacial till contains 2 to 8 percent by volume of rock fragments. The rock fragments are mixed in lithology, but shale is a significant component. A thin stone line or loamy or sandy layer is at the base of the upper sediment in some pedons. The mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 24 inches in thickness. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages between 35 and 48 percent clay and 15 and 35 percent sand. The upper sediment averages between 35 and 60 percent clay and between 10 to 30 percent sand. The sand is mostly fine and very fine.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Typically it is silty clay or silty clay loam, but clay loam is in the range. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw or Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It is firm or very firm. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bk or Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silty clay loam or silty clay. It has common masses of secondary carbonates. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nA 2Bw or 2Bk horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 3. It is loam or clay loam, but has a thin sandy layer in the upper part of some pedons. It has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 10 to 18 percent. It has few masses of secondary carbonates in the upper part in some pedons. The bulk density ranges from 1.35 to 1.6 g/cc. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
