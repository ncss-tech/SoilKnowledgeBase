  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Oakhill Series are moderately deep, well drained with moderate permeability.  They formed in residuum that weathered from diabase and basalt in the Culpeper Basin.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  Depth to Cr horizon, which is usually present, ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments of basalt gravel from 0 to 35 percent in the A horizon, from 35 to 55 percent in the B horizon and 35 to 90 percent in the C horizon.  Angular basalt cobbles range from 0 to 15 percent in the solum.  This soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid in the A horizon, unless limed, and moderately acid through neutral in the lower B and C horizons.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.\nThe thin A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, or neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 through 6.  The A horizon is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  Redder mottling is common in some pedons.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is variegated in shades of yellow, olive, brown, red and white.  It is sandy loam, silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nSome pedons may contain a thin Cr horizon of partially weathered basalt or diabase."

Conotton soils are formed in stratified sandy and gravelly materials and have a solum from 40 to 80 inches thick.  The Dorerton soils have free carbonates from 16 to 45 inches deep and limestone rock fragments in the lower part of the solum.  Hawksbill soils are more than 6 feet to bedrock and have greenstone, sandstone and phyllite rock fragments.  Leoni and Lutzke soils are formed in stratified outwash plains and have free carbonates in some part of the solum."
