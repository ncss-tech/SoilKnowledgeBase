The moisture control section (7 to 26 inches) is dry throughout from about mid-August to about mid-October (60 to 90 days) and is moist throughout from about November 15 to about May 15.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from about May 15 to about November 15 and exceeds 47 degrees F. from about July 1 to about October 1.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/3, 5/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/4, 5/4; 5YR 3/3, 4/3, or 4/4.

Reaction ranges from slightly or moderately acid.  Organic matter ranges from 4 to 20 percent but does not average higher than 10 percent in the top 20 inches.\nThe Bw horizon color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, or 6/4.
