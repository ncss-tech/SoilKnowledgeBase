  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Oysterlake series consists of very deep, moderately well and somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in a loamy mantle and underlying sandy-skeletal glacial outwash. They are on pitted outwash plains and end moraines. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the loamy mantle and very rapid in the underlying outwash. Mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.",

Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2. It is loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 1 to 15 percent gravel, 2 to 40 percent cobbles, 2 to 35 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture, rock fragment content, and reaction are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 1 to 30 percent gravel, 2 to 40 percent cobbles, 0 to 25 percent stones and 0 to 20 percent boulders. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC or 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture averages coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or sand in the fine-earth fraction. The upper part is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam in some pedons. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or sand in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."

Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 27 to 30 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. Elevation above sea level is 1400 to 1900 feet."
