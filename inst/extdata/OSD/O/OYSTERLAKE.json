  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The loamy mantle is 20 to 35 inches thick. The depth to free carbonates is greater than 80 inches. The rock fragment content averages 10 to 55 percent in the loamy mantle. The rock fragment content in the underlying outwash averages 35 to 90 percent with 15 to 65 percent gravel, 10 to 55 percent cobbles, 5 to 35 percent stones and 0 to 30 percent boulders.\nSome pedons have an O horizon up to 2 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 2. It is loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 1 to 15 percent gravel, 2 to 40 percent cobbles, 2 to 35 percent stones and 0 to 10 percent boulders. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture, rock fragment content, and reaction are similar to the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content ranges from 1 to 30 percent gravel, 2 to 40 percent cobbles, 0 to 25 percent stones and 0 to 20 percent boulders. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC or 2Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture averages coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or sand in the fine-earth fraction. The upper part is coarse sandy loam or sandy loam in some pedons. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is coarse sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or sand in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oysterlake soils are on convex to concave surfaces of pitted outwash plains and end moraines. They formed in a mantle of eolian or glacio-fluvial sediments and underlying glacial outwash deposited by the Rainy Lobe of late Wisconsin age. Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 27 to 30 inches. The frost-free period is 90 to 120 days. Elevation above sea level is 1400 to 1900 feet."

Runoff is low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate in the loamy mantle and very rapid in the underlying outwash."
