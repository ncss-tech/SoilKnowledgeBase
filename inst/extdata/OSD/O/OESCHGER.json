  "OVERVIEW": "The Oeschger series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone with minor amounts of siltstone and gravelly conglomerate. Oeschger soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 110 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1525 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
