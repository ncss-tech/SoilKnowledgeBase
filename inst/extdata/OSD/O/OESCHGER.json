    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oeschger soils are on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 15 to 110 percent. Elevations are 30 to 640 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone with minor amounts of siltstone and gravelly conglomerate. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1140 to 2160 millimeters. Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C, mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C, and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 300 days."
