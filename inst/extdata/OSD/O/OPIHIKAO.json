Slopes are dominately 2 to 12 percent, but range up to 20 percent.  The soils formed in a thin mantle of organic material overlying pahoehoe lava.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 1,524 to 3,048 millimeters (60 to 120 inches).  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1,270 to 1,905 millimeters (50 to 75 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 21 to 25 degrees C (70 to 77 degrees F).  The mean annual soil temperature is 22 degrees C or above (72 degrees F)."
