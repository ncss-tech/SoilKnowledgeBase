  "OVERVIEW": "The Oscura series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in fine textured sediments. These soils are on floodplains with slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
