  "OVERVIEW": "The Odell series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to dense till. Odell soils formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of silty material and in the underlying loamy till. They are on moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
