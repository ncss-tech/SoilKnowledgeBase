  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 through 32 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 through 40 inches. Rock fragments, dominantly channers of shale, siltstone or sandstone, range from 0 through 15 percent in the surface layer, 0 through 20 percent in the subsoil, and 0 through 35 percent in the substratum. The Cr has a rock fragment content of up to 90 percent. Unless limed, reaction throughout is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR of 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from loam to silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular. Consistence is very friable or friable. Some undisturbed pedons have black or very dark grayish brown A horizons, that are up to 5 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon up to 5 inches thick.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4 with a subhorizon having dominant chroma of 3 or more within 30 inches. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or silty clay loam. The B horizon has weak or moderate, fine through coarse subangular blocky structure, or prismatic parting to subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe 2C or C or Cr horizon has color range the same as the B horizon. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with channery analogs in thin subhorizons. It has plate like divisions which is inherited from the weathered bedrock.\nThe 2R horizon is soft shale or siltstone bedrock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Fremont series is the only other series in the same family. Fremont soils do not have bedrock within 40 inches.\nGreene, Jamestown, Kilmangh, Painesville, and Punsit series are in related families. Greene soils have a CEC activity class of active and are underlain by sandstone. Jamestown, Kilmangh, Painesville, and Punsit are all less acid than Orpark soils. In addition, Punsit soils are in the coarse-loamy family."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 through 45 inches; mean annual air temperature from 46 through 50 degrees F.; and the frost-free period ranges from 120 through 180 days. Elevation ranges from 250 through 1500 feet above sea level."

Alden and Chippewa soils are in wetter depressions. The Allis and Hornell soils are fine textured soils on similar landscapes. Blasdell and Chenango soils are very deep and occupy nearby gravelly terraces. The Derb soils are fine-silty soils on similar landscapes. Erie and Volusia soils are deep soils that contain a fragipan and are associated on similar landscapes. Tuller soils are in similar landscapes but contain more rock fragments and have bedrock at depths of 10 to 20 inches. Towerville soils are better drained associates on nearby ridges and hillsides."

Cambic horizon - the zone from 9 through 22 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons).\n3. Aquepts suborder - the zone between 13 and 20 inches has faces of peds with chroma 2 or less and redoximorphic concentrations. (Bw2 horizon.)\n4. Aeric subgroup - as evidenced by a zone between the base of the Ap horizon and a depth of 30 inches that has 50 percent or more of the matrix with chroma and value of 3 or more with redoximorphic features present (Bw1, Bw2 and C horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Sample No. NSSL 76P0461-75PO464.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
