    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ormsby soils are on low stream terraces.  These soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,400 to 1,465 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods year-round."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This revision updates the taxonomic subgroup from Aquic Durinodic Xeropsamments to Haploduridic Torripsamments.  The Ormsby soils mapped in the soil survey of Sierra Valley Area, California, have mollic epipedons and lack the duric feature, and need correlation in the future to another soil series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (Ap horizon).\nDuric feature - The zone from 60 to 112 cm (Cq1 and Cq2 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 91 and 152 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the Cq2, Cq3, and C' horizons).\nParticle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (C and Cq1 horizons and parts of the A and Cq2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location was sampled in 1959 and characterized by the soil survey laboratory in Riverside, CA as sample number S59Nev-3-7.  A separate adjacent pedon was also characterized as sample number S59Nev-3-8.  Data for both pedons is published in SSIR No. 23 (pages 146-149).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
