  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the four-month period following the summer solstice in most years in all parts of the soil between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  Depth to the water table ranges from 3 to 4 feet during periods in the winter.  The thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  Mottles that have chroma of 2 or less are at depths of less than 30 inches and commonly are throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.  It has weak platy or granular structure or is single grained or massive.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam and has 20 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  It has moderate or strong subangular blocky structure.  From 5 to 15 percent firm nodules or concretions are in the B2 horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Odin soils are on depressions and small basins with no natural outlets at elevations of 2,000 to 3,600 feet.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium high in ash and pumice.  The climate is semiarid with an annual precipitation of 8 to 12 inches.  Summers are warm and dry with an average temperature of 61 to 63 degrees F.  Winters are cool and moist with an average temperature of 30 to 34 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free period (32 degrees F.) is 100 to 130 days."

Deschutes soils are well drained, coarse-loamy, lack argillic horizons and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Madras soils are well drained, have duripan and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Stearns soils have natric horizons, are strongly sodic and have a duripan.  Redmond soils are well drained and lack argillic horizons."
