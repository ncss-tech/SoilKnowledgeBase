  "OVERVIEW": "The Ogden series consists of very poorly drained soils formed in herbaceous organic material over clayey lacustrine deposits or till on glacial lake plains and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The organic material is commonly 12 to 42 inches in thickness but ranges to 60 inches in some places.\nThe Oa horizon or less commonly Oe horizon has hue to 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is muck or less commonly mucky peat. Reaction is commonly moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma typically of 1 or 2 but ranges to 4. Texture is dominantly silty clay or clay, but the range includes silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay. In some places, the IIC2 horizon contains small snail shells, remnants of plants, and layers of mucky peat. Reaction is commonly neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Adrian, Carbondale, Cathro, Houghton, Palms, and Poygan soils. Adrian soils have a sandy substratum. Carbondale and Houghton soils have a thicker layer of organic materials. Cathro and Palms soils have a loamy substratum. Adrian, Carbondale, Cathro, Houghton, and Palms soils are on similar positions. Poygan soils formed entirely in till and are on slightly higher positions."

A seasonal high water table is less than 1 foot below the surface. These soils are subject to ponding. If drained, these soils are subject to subsidence and soil blowing."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Wisconsin NRCS State Office requested that null or missing OSD information be populated in the OSD Database so it can be accessed for reference. These references are critical for NRI sampling verification, program eligibility for onsite, and compliance review and checks. The status of the Ogden Series is inactive in the Official Soil Series database and no OSD is available.\nThe Ogden Series is believed to have been established in 1971 in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, based simply on the city name. Supporting historical documentation was not located to confirm this. Ogden Series has been correlated in the following counties: Brown, Fond du Lac, Kenosha, Milwaukee, Ozaukee, and Waukesha in Wisconsin, and Lenewee County in Michigan. The taxonomic classification of Ogden Series in these soil survey reports was either Histosols or clayey, euic, mesic Terric Medisaprists. No documentation located that indicates when or why the series was made inactive.\nTo satisfy the request from Wisconsin NRCS State Office, the Ogden Series is reactivated until field investigations are conducted to evaluate the range in properties and extent.\nThe ranges in this OSD are based on data available the above-mentioned soil survey reports and in NASIS (DMU Rec IDs 146359, 266933, 269778, 270213, 270839, 270982)."
