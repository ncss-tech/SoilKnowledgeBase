  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ocie series consists of deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils formed in hillslope sediments and the underlying residuum from cherty dolomite or limestone with thin interbedded sandstone.  These soils are on upland saddles, benches, and sideslopes. Slopes range from 1 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 56 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.",
