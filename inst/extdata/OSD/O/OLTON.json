  "STATES": "NM,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Olton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey, calcareous eolian sediments in the\nBlackwater Draw Formation of Pleistocene age. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping plains and upper side slopes of playas and draws. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 483 mm (19 in), and mean annual temperature is 15 degrees C (59 degrees F).",
