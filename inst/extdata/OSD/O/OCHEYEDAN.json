Based on redoximorphic features and field observations, the concept was changed to that of a soil with saturation in the lower part of the pedon in spring.\nA lacustrine substratum phase has been correlated in Clay County, Iowa and is of very minor extent. It is on a lake plain.\nIn parts of the MLRA this drainage class is called well drained based on the Soil Survey Manual.  Drainage class is a state interpretation.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
