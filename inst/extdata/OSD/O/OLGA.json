  "OVERVIEW": "The Olga series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey colluvium from shale bedrock.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep sides of valleys and have slopes ranging from 3 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 to 5 and 2 moist, and chroma of 1.  It typically is clay loam or silty clay loam, but included is clay and silty clay.  It ranges from neutral to medium acid.\nThe E horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  It has uncoated silt or sand grains on the faces of peds, which have value of 6 or 7.  The E horizon ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is clay or silty clay averaging between 45 and 60 percent clay.  It has moderate or strong grades of structure.  The Bt horizon ranges from medium to very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay or clay.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Some pedons have many shale fragments or shale bedrock within depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Chroma of 1 is allowed in the C horizons of those pedons.  A few pedons are neutral or slightly alkaline below depths of 40 inches."

Rolette and Rolla soils are on nearby glacial lake plains.  Rolla soils do not have a mollic epipedon or coarse fragments, and are very fine.  Barnes and Buse soils are on nearby till plains which were under grass.  Both soils are fine-loamy.  Bottineau, Kelvin and Waukon soils are on nearby glacial till plains.  Bottineau and Waukon soils are fine-loamy.  Kelvin and Waukon soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Brantford, Vang and Walsh soils are on nearby delta and outwash areas.  Brantford and Vang soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Walsh soils are fine-loamy."
