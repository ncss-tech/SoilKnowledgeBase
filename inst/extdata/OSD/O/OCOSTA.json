  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are saturated most of the year unless artificially drained.  The solum is 14 to 26 inches thick.  Rooting depth is normally limited to less than 20 inches because of continuous high water table.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The solum is very strongly acid or extremely acid.  The control section is dominantly clay or silty clay, averages 45 to 60 percent clay and contains less than 15 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry, and is mottled.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  This horizon has moderate or strong angular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and is mottled.  It is dominantly silty clay or clay but includes silty clay loam.  It has moderate or strong prismatic structure.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y and value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry.  It is stratified from clay to silt loam.  The Oa horizon may occur at any depth within the upper 60 inches.  Total combined thickness of the Oa horizons is less than 12 inches."

The soils formed in clayey alluvium deposited in the quiet water of coastal bays.   These soils occur in a coastal marine climate with relatively cool summers and mild wet winters.  They have an annual precipitation of 70 to 100 inches.  The average January temperature is 39 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 62 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 180 to 250 days."
