It typically is silt loam or silty clay loam, but included is loam and clay loam.  Some pedons have an ABk or ABkz horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of less than 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Salt accumulations are apparent in this horizon.  Some pedons have a Bky horizon.\nThe C horizon commonly has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY; and is variegated in some pedons.  It is laminated silt loam or silty clay loam. Stratified coarser or finer lake sediments or loam or clay loam glacial till are in some pedons below 40 inches.

Borup soils are coarse-silty.  Hegne soils are clayey. Perella soils do not have calcic horizons within 16 inches of the surface.  Vallers soils are fine-loamy.  Winger soils have glacial till within depths of 40 inches."
