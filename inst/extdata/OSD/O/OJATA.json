  "OVERVIEW": "The Ojata series consists of deep, poorly drained, moderately slowly or slowly permeable soils that formed in silty lake sediments.  These soils are on slightly depressed flats, swales, and channels in glacial lake and outwash plains and have slopes less than 1 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.",

Salt accumulations are apparent in this horizon.  Some pedons have a Bky horizon.\nThe C horizon commonly has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY; and is variegated in some pedons.  It is laminated silt loam or silty clay loam. Stratified coarser or finer lake sediments or loam or clay loam glacial till are in some pedons below 40 inches.  Visible salt accumulations are present in some pedons."

Borup soils are coarse-silty.  Hegne soils are clayey. Perella soils do not have calcic horizons within 16 inches of the surface.  Vallers soils are fine-loamy.  Winger soils have glacial till within depths of 40 inches."
