  "OVERVIEW": "The Oronoco series consists of deep well drained soils that formed in loamy aeolian sediments on dissected hilly uplands.  These soils have moderate permeability.  Their slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum and depth to free carbonates range from 48 to 84 inches.  The depth to the silty loess ranges from 50 to 100 inches or more.  Few through many krotovinas are in the upper part of the solum in some pedons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2, even 3 in some eroded soils.  This horizon is fine sandy loam or loam and is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has texture and reaction like the Ap horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  This horizon typically is fine sandy loam, but one or more subhorizons in the upper part commonly are loam.  The clay content in the control section averages between 10 and l8 percent.  In some pedons, one or more subhorizons in the upper part have as much as 22 percent clay.  The B/A clay ratios range from 1.4 to 1.8.  The Bt horizon is typically medium or slightly acid, but the lower part is neutral or mildly alkaline in some pedons.  A silt loam 2BC horizon is in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has mottles in some pedons.  A fine sandy loam C1 horizon is in some pedons.  A few pedons have loamy glacial till or limestone bedrock at depths as shallow as 60 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

The Backbone series has a 2R horizon of limestone bedrock beginning within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The Billett series has more medium sand and coarser particles in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon.  The Kingsley and Pardeeville series have more medium sand and coarse particles in their sola and C horizons and they formed in glacial till.  The Dickinson series has a mollic epipedon and a cambic horizon.  The Seaton series has a B horizon with more clay and less fine sand and coarser particles."
