The soils formed in moderately calcareous, laminated, medium textured, lacustrine material or old alluvium over these laminated sediments. The climate is semiarid and has dry summers. Average freeze-free period is 110 to 170 days, and average annual precipitation is 178 to 305 millimeters, including about 305 to 915 millimeters of snow. Average annual temperature is 9.5 to 11 degrees C."
