  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry but are moist in some part between depths of 8 and 20 inches for a period equal to more than 25 percent of the time that the soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F.  Depth to the duripan ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  The percentage of exchangeable sodium is high and decreases with increasing depth.  The control section contains less than 18 percent clay, less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and has no coarse fragments.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches and typically many feet.\nThe A and AC horizons have value of 5.5 or 6 dry and 4 to 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  The texture is commonly silt loam but ranges to very fine sandy loam.\nThe C1 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  The amount of durinodes ranges from 0 to 60 percent.\nThe duripan (C2casim horizon) ranges from strongly cemented to indurated.  It is massive or platy structured."

Burke, Minidoka, Nyssa and Stanfield soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to the duripan.  Also, Burke, Minidoka and Nyssa soils are mildly or moderately alkaline, have low exchangeable sodium, are well drained and lack a high water table.  Arritola soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the texture control section, are mildly to moderately alkaline and have low exchangeable sodium.  Crooked soils have sandy loam textured control section.  Frohman and Minveno soils are well drained, mildly to moderately alkaline and have low exchangeable sodium.  Nevoyer soils are moderately alkaline, commonly noncalcareous in the solum and have gravelly loam or fine sandy loam A and B horizons.  Scoon soils are mildly and moderately alkaline, have low exchangeable sodium and have some rock fragments ranging up to 35 percent in the textural control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Otoole soils are on nearly level low terraces at elevations from about 2,200 to 2,600 feet.  The soils formed in very deep mixed alluvium with various amounts of volcanic ash.  The climate is semiarid and has hot dry summers and cold winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 8 to 10 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 48 to 53 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 110 to 150 days."
