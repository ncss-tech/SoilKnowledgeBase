  "OVERVIEW": "The Omak series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in intermixed glaciolacustrine sediments and glacial till with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on glaciolacustrine influenced moraines and terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

Depth to the silica-cemented duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.
