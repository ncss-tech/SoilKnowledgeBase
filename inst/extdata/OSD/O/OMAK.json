These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.35 to 1.45 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.   Depth to the silica-cemented duripan ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is loam or silt loam and is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt part of the Bt/E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  The E part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 6 through 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chromas of 1 through 3 moist or dry.  Both are 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Both are slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR , value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bqm horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is stratified and crushes to sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bkqm horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 6 or 7 dry,4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It crushes to sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Omak soils are on glaciolacustrine influenced moraine and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in intermixed glaciolacustrine sediments and glacial till with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  Elevations range from 2,100 to 3,000 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 15 to 20 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 24 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 67 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
