  "OVERVIEW": "The Oran series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 30 to 66 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying loamy glacial till. These soils are on interfluves and long side slopes on dissected till plains on the Iowan Erosion Surface. Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 millimeters.",
