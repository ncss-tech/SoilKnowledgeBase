  "OVERVIEW": "The Ohwiler series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium derived from mixed sources, mostly sandstone and shale.  Ohwiler soils are on mountain slopes and mountain valleys.  Slopes range from 3 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 559 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
