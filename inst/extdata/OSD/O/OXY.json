    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. Solum thickness and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 105 consecutive days following summer solstice. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches or to a lithic contact. The texture is dominantly silt loam but many pedons have thin lenses of sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or clay loam. The organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth. The particle-size control section has 18 to 30 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel in the upper part and 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles in the lower part.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, sandy loam or clay loam. It has 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

The climate is characterized by warm and dry summers and cool and moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches. The average January temperature is 26 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."
