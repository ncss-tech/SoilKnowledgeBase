Bellehelen, Brier and Nuhelen are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July to October due to convection storms. Duco soils have a soil temperature of 10 to 12 degrees C and average 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Horseflat soils  lack secondary silica coatings over the bedrork.   Ocud soils have a lithic contact within 36 cm. Reywat soils are dry 60 to 80 days have Bt horizons that are typically slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and are calcareous in the lower part. Upatad soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
