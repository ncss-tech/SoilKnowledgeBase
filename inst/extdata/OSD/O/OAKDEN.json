  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",

These soils are usually dry but are continually moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 1/4 of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nThe Ak horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3. It usually has weak fine granular structure but has a thin platy surface in some pedons. This horizon is strongly calcareous and has common lime threads, masses or nodules.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist. It is loam or sandy loam. This horizon has weak fine subangular blocky structure or it is massive."

The soils formed in very shallow highly calcareous material over an indurated lime hardpan and limestone bedrock. The climate is dry subhumid. Mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. Mean summer temperature is 64 to 66 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches. March, April, and May are the wettest months and June is the driest. Frost-free period is 100 to 108 days."
