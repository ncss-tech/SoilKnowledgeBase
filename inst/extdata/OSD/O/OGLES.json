Average content of gravel, cobble and stone size rock fragments range from 15 to 60 percent in the A horizon, and from 35 to 85 percent in the B and C horizons. Thin layers or lenses with less rock fragments may occur. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. A horizons with value of 3 are less than 7 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.

Alonzville and Coursey soils are on low stream terraces and have a fine loamy argillic horizon. Gladehill, Irongate and Wolfgap soils have a mollic epipedon. In addition, Irongate soils are moderately well drained."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas remain in their natural vegetation. Some areas have been cleared and are used as pasture. The overstory in most forested areas consists of sycamore, red maple, black locust, white oak, Virginia pine, and yellow-poplar. The understory consists of flowering dogwood, eastern white pine, cedar, blackberry, poison ivy, Virginia creeper and greenbrier."
