Reaction is more than 4.5 in. 0.0lM calcium chloride in all parts of the organic material.  Reaction of the underlying material ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to l0YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of l to 3; or it is neutral with value of 2.  Fiber content ranges from 20 to 90 percent unrubbed and less than 30 percent after rubbing.\nThe Oe horizon has hue of 5YR to l0YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Fiber content is dominantly 50 to 90 percent unrubbed and less than 40 percent rubbed.  Texture is dominantly mucky peat.  However thin, less than l0 inches, layers may be either sapric (muck) or fibric (peat).\nThe 2Cg horizon, where present, has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of l or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay.\nThe 3 Cg horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of l or 2; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy clay or clay.  Fragments, less than 3 inches in size, of shell, snails, and secondary calcium carbonate accumulations, range up to l0 percent by volume."
