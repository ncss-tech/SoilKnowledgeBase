  "OVERVIEW": "The Olyic series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt. Olyic soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 days in the control section during the summer. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry. It commonly is silt loam but ranges to loam and clay loam in some pedons. This horizon has strong or moderate granular structure. It has 10 to 15 percent concretions and small pebbles. It is strongly to medium acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR value of 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry. It is silty clay loam or clay loam and has 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. This horizon has few to common thin clay films. It averages 5 to 25 percent gravel. It is strongly to very strongly acid.\nThe horizons below depth of 36 inches have up to 60 percent rock fragments in some pedons."

The soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt. The climate is subhumid with cool, moist winters and cool dry summers. The average annual precipitation is about 60 to 90 inches. Average July temperature is 64 degrees F., average January temperature is 34 degrees F., and the average annual temperature is 47 degrees to 52 degrees F. The frost-free season is 145 to 200 days."
