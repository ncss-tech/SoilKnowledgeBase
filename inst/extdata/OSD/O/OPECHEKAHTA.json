  "OVERVIEW": "The Opechekahta series consists of deep to very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived primarily from limestone over residuum derived from red silty shale.  Opechekahta soils are on escarpments and in canyons in foothills and mountains.  Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees  C.",
