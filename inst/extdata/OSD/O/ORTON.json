  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The depth to loose sand and gravel typically is about 24 to 28 inches and ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches in thickness and typically extends through the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 moist.  It typically is loam, but includes silt loam and fine sandy loam.  It has weak thick platy or fine or medium granular structure.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is a loam or fine sandy loam averaging less than 18 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or gravelly sandy loam.  It has common to many fine and medium accumulations of carbonate.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It contains as much 15 percent gravel by volume in the lower part.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam or gravelly sandy loam.  It contains as much as 20 percent gravel by volume.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon is multi-colored loose medium or coarse sand and gravel containing carbonates.  It is sand or loamy sand containing 20 to 60 percent gravel by volume.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Orton soils are on nearly level to moderately steep terraces or terrace remnants that cap ridges, crests, and upper slopes on undulating or rolling terrain.  Surfaces are plane or convex with slope gradients ranging from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in loamy alluvium or outwash sediments overlying sand and gravel.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 24 inches."

Betts, Glenham, and Java soils have a fine-loamy control section and formed in glacial till on uplands.   Canning and Ree soils have fine-loamy argillic horizons and are on similar topographic positions.  Lowry and Sully soils are on similar topographic positions and have a coarse-silty control section. Oahe soils are on smoother landscapes and are fine-loamy over sandy skeletal."
