  "OVERVIEW": "The Oelop series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and eolian material derived from sandstone and shale.  Oelop soils are on stream terraces, mesas, plateaus and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
