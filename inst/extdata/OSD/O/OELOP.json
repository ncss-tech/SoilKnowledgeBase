Penistaja soils are noneffervescent in the argillic. Balon soils are noneffervescent throughout.  Tamarindo soils have an argillic greater than 70 inches thick.  Blancot and Mentmore soils have hue yellower than 10YR.  Buckle, Palacid and Quagwa soils have an argillic base deeper than 40 inches.  Cerropelon, Cumacho, Gaddes, Hagerwest, Gapbutte, Gapmesa and Hagerman soils have bedrock within 60 inches.  Doakum soils have secondary carbonates in the argillic.  Chilerojo, Fort, Olney, and Sundance soils occur on the Great Plains.  Redpen and Yenlo soils contain more than 40 percent sand.
