  "OVERVIEW": "The Orrville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvium on flood plains. Permeability is moderate in the upper solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower solum and underlying material. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

They formed in alluvium from upland areas of low-lime drift, and from areas of sandstone, siltstone, shale, and limestone. They are in or bordering areas of Wisconsinan or Illinoian glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 57 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from 110 to 200 days, and elevation ranges from 340 to 1,360 feet above msl."

Chagrin, Holly, and Lobdell soils are in a drainage sequence with Orrville soils. The well drained Chagrin soils are on high positions on the landscape, the very poorly drained Holly soils are in depressions and abandoned stream channels, and the moderately well drained Lobdell soils are on slightly higher landscape positions than Orrville soils. Chili, Fitchville, Sebring, and Wheeling soils are on terraces on nearby landscapes and have argillic horizons; in addition, Chili and Wheeling soils formed in stratified outwash materials, and Fitchville and Sebring soils formed in lacustrine sediments. The poorly drained Washtenaw soils are in depressions or swales on the flood plain."

Permeability is moderate in the upper solum and moderate or moderately rapid in the lower solum and underlying material. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 0.5 to 1.0 foot from November to May in normal years. Orrville soils are subject to occasional or frequent flooding."

Narrow areas and those dissected by old stream channels are in woodland and permanent pasture. The original vegetation was deciduous forest."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A bedrock substratum phase with sandstone at 60 to 80 inches is currently recognized. Earlier surveys correlated a bedrock substratum phase with sandstone or siltstone at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. This phase will need to be evaluated during MLRA update activities.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na) Ochric epipedon - from a depth of 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon).\nb) Cambic horizon - from a depth of 9 to 41 inches (Bw, Bg1 and Bg2 horizons).\nc) Aquic conditions - from a depth of 0 to 60 inches.\nd) Udic moisture regime.\nThis revision reflects a change in taxonomic classification from Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts to Fluventic Endoaquepts due to updates contained in the 9th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified.\nAcreage based on 2004 data.\n08/2005-The competing series were compared by the 9th Edition of Keys to Soils Taxonomy following revision of taxonomic class of the series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
