  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is 50 to more than 80 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 64 to 67 degrees F at 20 inches and remains above 47 degrees F throughout the year.  The soil is dry between 13 and 36 inches in most years from June 1 to October 15, moist in all parts from December 1 to May 1 and moist in some part the rest of the year.  Weighted average clay content of the textural control section is 18 to 27 percent.  Some part of the upper 30 inches of the argillic horizon has 60 to 75 percent base saturation.  The amount of coarse plus very coarse sand is 20 to 35 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/3, 5/2, 4/3; or 7.5YR 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4, 3/3, 3/2; or 7.5YR 3/4.  Clay content is 8 to 16 percent.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral but can be moderately acid where heavily fertilized.  Organic matter content is 1 to 2 percent in the upper 4 to 9 inches, and is less than 1 percent below this depth.  An A/B horizon caused by plowing is lacking in some profiles.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 6/4, 5/6, 5/4, 4/6, 5YR 5/6, 5/4 or 4/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/6, 4/4, 3/4, 5YR 4/6 or 3/4.  A variegated color of 10YR 4/6 dry and 10YR 3/4 moist is in the lower part of some pedons.  Texture is coarse sandy loam or sandy clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay in the upper part and 15 to 20 percent clay in the lower part.  The clay percentage decreases by 20 to 35 percent from the maximum within a depth of 60 inches.  Mineralogy is mixed but dominantly kaolinitic.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nIn some pedons a C horizon occurs below 50 inches.  Color, texture, and reaction are similar to the lower part of the Bt horizon."

These soils formed in coarse textured alluvium derived dominantly from granitic rock sources.  The climate is characterized by having hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation of 19 to 24 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 60 to 62 degrees F, mean January temperature is 45 degrees F and mean July temperature is 78 degrees F.
