De Masters soils are more than 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Brinegar soils are mottled at 30 to 45 inches and have a water table within 30 inches in early spring.  Pinehurst soils are moderately acid or strongly acid in the argillic horizon.  Said soils have a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and are 20 to 30 percent hard rock fragments in the argillic horizon.  Watchabob soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact."

These soils formed in weathered sandstone mixed with loess in the surface. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 22 inches.  The average January temperature is 23 degrees F., the average July temperature is 68 degrees F., and average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
