    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is moist in all horizons but is dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F.  Weighted average of angular, granitic pebbles in the control section range from 5 to 20 percent. Sand in the control section is dominantly angular and granitic.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe E horizon, when present has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 when dry, 4 or 5 when moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist..\nThe Bw has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It has very fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  Pebble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe BC horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Angular granitic pebbles range from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  Texture is sand, gravelly sand, or loamy sand.  Angular granitic pebbles range from 10 to 25 percent.   It has few to common fine and medium distinct stainings in most pedons."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from the mineral surface to 9 inches and a cambic horizon from 9 to 18 inches.  The upper 9 inches of this pedon is estimated to have 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percnet.
