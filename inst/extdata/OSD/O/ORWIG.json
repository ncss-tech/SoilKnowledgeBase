  "BYREV": "Rev. NCD/RJE/TLA",
  "REVDATE": "06/1999",
  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Orwig series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in outwash derived from granitic rocks with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  These soils are on terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F.  Weighted average of angular, granitic pebbles in the control section range from 5 to 20 percent. Sand in the control section is dominantly angular and granitic.  The soil is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe E horizon, when present has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 when dry, 4 or 5 when moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist..\nThe Bw has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It has very fine to medium subangular blocky structure.  Pebble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe BC horizon has value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Angular granitic pebbles range from 5 to 10 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  Texture is sand, gravelly sand, or loamy sand.  Angular granitic pebbles range from 10 to 25 percent.   It has few to common fine and medium distinct stainings in most pedons."

The upper 9 inches of this pedon is estimated to have 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percnet.
