Nodular plinthite ranges from 5 to 10 percent and is within 30 to 50 inches of the surface.  Glossic materials range from 15 to 30 percent by volume in some layer at a depth of 30 to 50 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 35 to 75 percent at 60 inches below the top of the argillic horizon.  The Btvx/E horizons have 15 to about 40 percent by volume slightly brittle matrix materials.  Siliceous pebbles and ironstone pebbles range from none to about 10 percent throughout the solum.  The combined thickness of the A and E horizons ranges from 8 to 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 4.  Texture of the A and E horizons is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral except where the soil has been limed.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral except where soil has been limed.\nThe Bt horizons are typically sandy clay loam but include fine sandy loam and clay loam.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles in shades of red and brown range from none to common.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt3 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles range from few to many in shades of brown, red, yellow, and gray.  Depth to horizons having mottles with chroma of 2 or less is greater than 30 inches.  Up to 15 percent of the Bt3 horizon is brittle, mainly in the red and yellowish brown areas of some pedons.  Skeletans of clean sand make up 1 to 15 percent by volume in the lower part of this horizon in some pedons.  Reaction ranges from very strong acid to slightly acid.\nThe Btv/E and Btvx/E horizons have a brownish or yellowish matrix that is mottled in shades of brown, yellow, gray, or red.  The matrix of the Btv or Btvx horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Interfingering or pockets of clean sand grains (skeletans) range from 15 to 30 percent by volume.  The texture is typically sandy clay loam, but includes fine sandy loam and clay loam.  The reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe B't horizon, present in most pedons, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles range from few to many in shades of gray, red, yellow or brown.  Texture is sandy clay loam or clay loam with clay content of 30 to 40 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC or C horizon at depths of 60 inches or more.  The BC or C horizon, when present, have colors in shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray.  They typically are mottled or stratified with these colors. Texture is mainly fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam, but may be stratified with these textures or with unconsolidated sandstone and shaly soil materials.  Some pedons contain a few thin plates of plinthite or nodular plinthite fragments in the upper part. The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Splendora series in the same family and the similar Bernaldo, Bowie, Cuthbert, Duralde Gasil, Hockley, Kirvin, Segno, Wockley, and Warnock series.  Splendora soils have less than 5 percent by volume of plinthite, are shallower to a water table, have gray mottles within 30 inches of the surface, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Hockley, Segno and Wockley soils receive more than 30 inches of summer rainfall, have a summer moisture deficit of less than 4 inches, are shallower to a water table, and have less than 5 percent glossic materials in the lower Bt horizon.  In addition, Wockley soils have mottles of low chroma due to wetness within 30 inches of the surface.  Bernaldo soils do not have brittle subhorizons and contain less than  5 percent plinthite.  Bowie, Cuthbert, Kirvin, and Warnock soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Duralde soils are fine-silty and have mixed mineralogy.  Gasil soils have P-E indices less than 64 and are in the ustic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oakwood soils occupy broad gently sloping to moderately sloping uplands of the Coastal Plain.   Slopes range from 1 to 8  percent.  The soil formed in thick beds of loamy material that are interbedded with sandy and shaly materials of the Claiborne Geological Group and ancient fluvitile terraces.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 64 to 68 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 46 inches.  Frost free days range from 240 to 260 days and elevation ranges from 250 to 550 feet.   Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 64 to 72.  Summer rainfall ranges from 25 to 30 inches and summer moisture deficit ranges from 4 to 6 inches."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was formerly included with the Bowie soils.\nThe series was originally established and defined as a Plinthic Paleudalf.  A field study of this series throughout the area of its occurrence in 1990 has shown this soil to have 15 to 30 percent glossic material and brittleness in the lower argillic horizons.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 12 inches.  (Ap and E horizons)\nArgillic horizon - 12 to 84 inches.  (Bt and Bt/E horizons)\nGlossic materials - 38 to 67 inches.  (Bt/E horizons)\nFragic feature - more than 25 percent by volume of brittle materials.  (Btvx/E2 and Btvx/E3 horizons.)\nPlinthite - 38 to 67 inches.  (Bt/E horizons)\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Soil sampled for characterization by TAMU (Smith County, TX - S90TX-423-001) (Wood County, TX - S89TX-499-004).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
