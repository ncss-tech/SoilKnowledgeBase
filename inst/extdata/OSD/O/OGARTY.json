  "OVERVIEW": "The Ogarty series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and material weathered from andesite.  Ogarty soils are on uplands at elevations of 200 to 1,000 feet.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
