Hochheim soils occupy similar positions on the landscape where the underlying loamy till was not buried by the more recently deposited reddish clayey till.  The B horizon of Hochheim soils contains more sand and less clay.  The somewhat poorly drained Manawa and poorly drained Poygan soils occupy drainageways that separate higher areas of Omro soils."

Permeability is moderately slow or slow in the clayey till and moderate in the loamy till. These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 61 to 107 cm (2 to 3.5 feet) for 1 month or more in 6 or more out of 10 years."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was mapped as inclusions of the Kewaunee series in adjacent counties to Winnebago County.\n11/04  4700 acres with a well drained typical pedon were correlated as a temperature taxadjunct in Door County, WI because they are in the frigid temperature zone. A new series is needed.\n11/04  3020 acres are correlated in Kewaunee County, WI where the well drained typical pedon has a glossic horizon (Haplic Glossudalf). A new series is needed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 20 cm (0 to 8 inches) (Ap);  argillic horizon - 20 to 71 cm (8 to 28 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3); Oxyaquic feature  redox accumulations and saturation within 102 cm (40 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to soil survey sample number S75WI-139-001 for NSSL data on the typical pedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
