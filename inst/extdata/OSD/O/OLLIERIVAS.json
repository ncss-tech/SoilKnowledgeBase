Adios soils are calcareous in the lower part of the particle-size control section and the duripan is 6 inches or less thick.  Barnard and Seval soils are underlain by alluvial material under the duripan, have calcareous and silica mixed duripans, and are slightly to moderately calcareous within all or some part of the argillic horizon. Fleischmam soils are underlain by alluvial material under the duripan, and calcareous and silica mixed duripans.  Xerta soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the Btk horizon, have an abrupt boundary between the A and Bt horizon and have a duripan that is 4 inches or less thick."
