  "OVERVIEW": "The Ogeechee series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in thick beds of loamy fluvial and marine sediments.  The soils are on nearly level broad flats, drainageways, and slight depressions on the lower Coastal Plain generally below about 50 feet elevation.  Slopes are from 0 to 2 percent.",

Reaction of the soil is extremely acid to strongly acid, except where limed and some pedons may have moderately acid reaction in the lower B and C horizons.  Some pedons may contain few fine flakes of mica throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The range in texture is the same as the A horizon.\nThe BEg horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or the horizon is neutral with value of 4 through 7.  Masses of iron accumulation are few to many in shades of yellow and brown.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or the horizon is neutral with value of 4 through 7.  Masses of iron accumulation are common or many in shades of yellow, brown, or red.  Some pedons may have a lower Bt sub horizon without dominant matrix hue and have masses of iron accumulation in shades of yellow, brown or red and iron depletions.  It is commonly clay loam or sandy clay loam, but some pedons have subhorizons of clay or sandy clay.  The upper 20 inches of the horizon has an average clay content of 20 to 35 percent, and less than 20 percent silt.  Some pedons may have pockets of gray coarser textured material 2 to 6 inches in diameter.\nThe BCg horizon, where present, has colors the same as the Btg horizon.  It is sandy loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y, or 10YR, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 1 or 2 or the horizon is neutral with value of 5 through 8.  It ranges from sand to clay loam and commonly is stratified with sand, loamy sand, sandy clay loam, or clay."
