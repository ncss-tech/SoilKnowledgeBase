  "OVERVIEW": "The Olot series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and colluvium and residuum weathered from basalt. Olot soils are on plateaus and mountains and have slopes of 2 to 90 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils have moist bulk densities of 0.85 g/cc or less and contain 60 to 70 percent glass and less than 12 percent 15-bar moisture content (dry sample) in the ash overlay. Thickness of the ash ranges from 14 to 20 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The soils have 0 to 0.1 percent of the surface area covered with stones. The soil reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is ashy silt loam or stony ashy silt loam with 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 5 moist and dry. It has 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe buried 2Bb horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry. It is extremely cobbly or very cobbly silt loam, loam or silty clay loam and is 25 to 35 percent clay, 15 to 60 percent cobbles, 10 to 35 percent gravel, and 0 to 5 percent stones."

Brannan, Crackler, Dufort, Elbowlake, Kellerbutte, Kootenai, Natapoc, Nevine, and Saska soils are greater than 40 inches to bedrock. Capoose soils have 1 to 12 percent clay in the lower particle-size control section and 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass in the upper particle-size control section. Rouen soils are 20 to 40 inches to argillite bedrock and the 2Bw horizon has less than 10 percent cobbles and more than 30 percent gravel. Vingulch soils have less than 18 percent clay in the lower part of the pscs with sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand fine-earth textures.\nThe Crackercreek and Dufort soils have a similar classification.  Crackercreek soils are 40 to 60 inches to bedrock and have a glassy over mixed mineralogy.  Dufort soils are very deep to bedrock and have a glassy over mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Olot soils are on plateaus, canyons, mountains and structural benches.   Elevations are typically 2,800 to 5,000 feet, commonly on north and northeast-facing slopes but range to 6,200 feet on south-facing slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 90 percent. These soils formed in silty volcanic ash deposited over a buried soil that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from basalt. The climate is characterized by cold and wet winters and hot and dry summers. The average annual precipitation is 17 to 42 inches; the average annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.; and the frost free period is 30 to 110 days."
