Soil reaction is very strongly acid, or strongly acid except for surfaces that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt, silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bwl horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4. Grayish iron depletions range from none to common. It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, silt, or loam. The Bw2 horizon has a matrix color similar to the Bwl horizon, except that grayish iron depletions are few to many, or the horizon is variegated in shades of brown and gray. It is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam. Clay content in the particle size control section is 7 to 18 percent.\nThe BEb or EBb horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4, or they are variegated in shades of brown and gray.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Barling series.  Series in similar families are the Ariel, Chenneby, Chewacla, Collins, Gillsburg, Kirkville, Lobelville, McRaven, Riedtown, and Velda series. Barling soils do not have a buried solum or have clay depletions on faces of prisms. Ariel soils do not have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the surface. Chenneby soils have a fine-silty particle-size class. Chewacla soils have a fine-loamy particle-size class. Collins soils have bedding planes in the upper 20 inches. Gillsburg soils have a gray matrix color within 20 inches of the surface. Kirkville soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size class and have siliceous mineralogy, and do not have a buried solum. Lobelville soils have a fine-loamy particle-size class and have siliceous mineralogy. McRaven soils have a grayish matrix color within a depth of 20 inches, and the lower part of the B horizon is medium acid to moderately alkaline. Riedtown soils are medium acid to moderately alkaline in the B horizon. Velda soils have siliceous mineralogy and do not have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oaklimeter soils are on flood plains or flood prone low stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The soil formed in silty alluvium along streams that drain the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands, MLRA 134. The climate is warm and humid. Near the type location the mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 55 inches."

These soils are associated with each other across the nearly linear surfaces of flood plains. Ariel and Collins soils are in slightly higher positions, mainly on natural levees. Arkabutla, Chenneby, and Gillsburg soils are somewhat poorly drained and are in similar positions as the Oaklimeter soils, and in addition, Arkabutla soils have a fine-silty particle size class and are predominantly gray within 20 inches of the surface. Vicksburg soils have bedding planes and do not have iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less within 20 inches of the surface. They are well drained and are on natural levees."
