  "OVERVIEW": "The Ojinaga series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic horizon. The soils are well drained and moderately rapidly permeable above and below a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon. They formed in gravelly pedisediments and occur on fan remnants. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 70 degrees F.",
