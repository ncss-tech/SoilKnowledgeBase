  "OVERVIEW": "The Osborn Series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sandstone with a mantle of volcanic ash. Osborn soils are on mountain side slopes. Slopes are 30 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to the paralithic contact with soft sandstone ranges from 24 to 40 inches. The average annual soil temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F. The soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days during summer and fall. The particle-size control section averages 45 to 70 percent sand in the fine earth fraction. The upper 7 to 10 inches of the pedon has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 1.00 g/cc, glass content of 20 to 30 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of less than 12 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. The A2 horizon, when present, is ashy sandy loam or gravelly ashy sandy loam. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is gravelly sandy loam, paragravelly sandy loam, sandy loam or loam and contains 0 to 20 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent sandstone paragravel. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist. Texture is paragravelly sandy loam or very paragravelly loam and contains 0 to 10 percent gravel and 30 to 60 percent sandstone paragravel. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bercumb, Moscow, Moso, Paige (T), Roslyn, Smith (T) and Volperie soils. Bercumb, Roslyn and Smith soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock. Moso soils are 40 to 60 inches to paralithic granite bedrock. Moscow soils lack sandstone paragravel in the particle-size control section. Paige soils cannot be competed due to lack of an OSD within the database. Volperie soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice and have 5 to 15 percent mica in the particle-size control section. Soils with similar classification with mixed mineralogy are the Aits, Apex, Canteen, Centralpeak, Leadpoint, and Waits soils. Aits, Apex, Canteen, and Waits soils are deep. Centralpeak soils are dry 60 to 75 days and have no weathered sandstone in the particle-size control section. Leadpoint soils have a value of 2 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0 to 2 throughout and are neutral to moderately alkaline."

Elevations are 2,900 to 4,600 feet. The soils are in a continental climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches. The mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. The growing season at 28 degrees F. is 145 to 170 days and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
