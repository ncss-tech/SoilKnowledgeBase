  "STATES": "IA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ottosen series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in moderately fine textured glacial or lacustrine sediments that overlie medium textured glacial till or sediments. They are on nearly level and gently undulating ground moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The moderately fine textured sediments are 24 to 40 inches thick. In some pedons the thickness of the solum corresponds to the thickness of the sediments. In other pedons the solum extends a few inches into the underlying material. Solum thickness is typically 30 to 40 inches and ranges from 24 to 50 inches. Depth to free carbonates is about the same as the thickness of the solum but is a few inches less in many pedons. The 10 to 40 inch control section averages from 30 to 35 percent clay and from 15 to 30 percent fine sand or coarser. The moderately fine textured sediments typically average about 10 to 25 percent fine sand or coarser and about 32 to 36 percent clay, but the range in average clay content is 30 to 40 percent. The amount of rock fragments is less than 5 percent, and they are absent in many pedons.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2, and chroma of 0 or 1. The A horizon is silty clay loam or clay loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 and chroma of 2. The lower part has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silty clay loam or clay loam. The upper part of the Bw horizon typically is slightly acid or neutral, and the lower part typically is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon typically has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Crippin, Floyd, Fostoria, Kensett, Merton, Nicollet, Readlyn, Snider, and Wilmonton soils. Crippin soils are calcareous throughout. Floyd soils have a B horizon formed in stratified loamy sediments and are leached more deeply. Fostoria soils have less clay in their sola, and more stratification in the lower B and C horizons. Kensett soils have limestone bedrock within 40 inches. Merton and Nicollet soils have less clay in their sola. Also, Nicollet soils formed entirely in friable, loam glacial till and have a higher content of sand in the upper part of the solum. Readlyn soils are more acid, have less clay in their sola, and the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon are firm glacial till. Snider soils contain less clay in the solum and are leached of carbonates to a depth of 48 inches or more. Wilmonton soils have firm, clay loam or loam glacial till at depths less than 30 inches and have a more permeable solum."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Ottosen soils formed in silty clay loam or clay loam sediments that overlie friable glacial till or sediments of loam texture. In contrast to typical relief on the Wisconsin till plain, relief is low, knobs of well drained soils are less common and less distinct, and depressions are few, shallow, and indistinct. Mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 to 32 inches."

Clarion, Nicollet and Webster soils form a drainage sequence associated with the Bode, Ottosen, and Kossuth soils, but are lower in clay content. The Ottosen and Nicollet soils are on intermediate elevations. Kossuth and Webster soils are lower on the landscape, and Bode and Clarion soils are higher."
