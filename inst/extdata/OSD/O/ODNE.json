Solum thickness ranges from 45 to 80 inches.\nThe A horizons range in moist chroma from 1 to 2, in moist value from 4 to 5, in 10YR and 2.5Y hues, texture ranges from silt loam to silty clay loam, and reaction ranges from moderately acid to strongly acid.\nThe Blg horizons range in moist chroma from 1 to 2, in moist value from 4 to 5, in 10YR to 5Y hues, texture ranges from silt loam to silty clay loam, and reaction ranges from moderately to strongly acid.\nTexture of the B2gt horizons is dominantly silty clay loam, but in places it is heavy silt loam or clay loam.  Moist hue of the B2gt horizons range from 10YR to 5Y, moist value ranges from 4 or 5 and moist chroma ranges from 1 to 2.  Clay films in the B2gt horizons range from medium continuous to thick continuous on peds and in pores. Reaction of the B2gt horizons range from moderately acid to slightly acid.\nThe B3g horizons range in moist chroma from 1 to 2, in moist value from 4 to 5, in hues of 10YR to 5Y, texture ranges from loam or clay loam to silt loam or silty clay loam, and reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral.  The B2gt horizons tongue into the B3g horizons in most pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:   Odne soils occur in terrace drainageways and basins at elevations of 100 to 500 feet.  The regolith consists of mixed alluvium containing some ash.  Odne soils occur in a mild marine climate having an annual precipitation of 40 to 60 inches with relatively cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  The average January temperature is 37 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 64 degrees F.; and the mean temperature is 50.degrees F.  The average growing season is about 200 days."
