    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates is 12 to 30 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 1 to 10 percent by volume of the profile.  The particle size control section averages between 10 and 18 percent non-carbonate clay with 1 to 8 percent clay size carbonates and 45 to 65 percent total sand.  Some subhorizons may have up to 22 percent non-carbonate clay.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for as long as 45 consecutive days for the 120 days following the summer solstice.  It is also not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days per year in 6 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 0 to 2 moist.  It is typically  loam but includes fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam and sandy loam. The clay content ranges from 10 to 22 percent and the sand ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  The reaction is neutral to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist. It has redoximorphic features in some pedons.  It is typically is fine sandy loam but includes very fine sandy loam, loam, and sandy loam.  The clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent and the sand ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and typically has redoximorphic features.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or sandy loam.  The clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent and the sand ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  Carbonate filaments and masses are typically common to many.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 20 to 30 percent in the upper part and 12 to 25 percent below 40 inches..\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 6 moist and typically has redoximorphic features.  Typically it is very fine sandy loam but loam, fine sandy loam and sandy loam are included.  The clay content ranges from 10 to 18 percent and the sand ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  There are few to common carbonate filaments and masses.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 12 to 25 percent."

Firth soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for 90 or more cumulative days each year.  Hagensville soils do not have secondary carbonates in the series control section.  Ogdensburg and Sundell soils have bedrock within depths of 60 inches.  Tolna soils have sand and gravelly sand within the series control section."
