  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ocashe are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite and tuff with surficial additions of eolian volcanic ash.  The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,955 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 300 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
