    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Covert, Covertfalls, Gratten, Melita, Menominee, Ocqueoc, and Yalmer series are in related families. The Covert and Gratten soils do not have contrasting loamy textures within the series control section. The Covertfalls soils have a mesic temperature regime. Melita soils are sands overlying loamy deposits at depths greater than 40 inches. The Menominee and Yalmer soils are underlain by loamy material with argillic horizons. Ocqueoc soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the solum and lack rock fragments in the substratum. They also have redder hues in the substratum."

They are usually on slightly convex slopes or undulating landforms of outwash plains and old glacial lake shorelines. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 38 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F, and the mean frost-free season ranges from 100 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 200 to 1000 feet above sea level."

Adams, Croghan, Bice, Schroon, and Kalurah soils are also associated. The Adams and Croghan soils are on similar landscapes, but do not have a loamy substratum within a 60 inch depth. The Bice, Schroon and Kalurah soils usually occur on smoother slopes and have loamy textures throughout."

It is under study whether this is correct for Entic and Aquentic subgroups. This represents a partial update of the series to Established. Not all items were reviewed at this time.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\n2) Spodic horizon - from a depth of 6 to 13 inches\n(Bs1 and Bs2 horizons).\n3) Aquentic subgroup - redoximorphic features within 30\ninches of the soil surface, sandy PSC.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
