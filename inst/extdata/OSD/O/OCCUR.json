Redoximorphic features consisting of concentrations of Fe/Mn oxides, or Fe and clay depletions occur within 30 inches of the mineral soil surface. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the surface layer, from 0 to 30 percent in the subsoil, and from 5 to 35 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral in the solum and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nSome pedons have a thin Oi or Oe horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loamy fine sand or loamy sand, and less commonly fine sand or sand in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sand, loamy sand or sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak subangular blocky or it is single grain. Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 5 and chroma of 4 through 6. It may have faint or distinct redox concentrations in the lower part. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak subangular blocky or it is single grain. Consistence is very friable, friable or loose.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. It has faint or distinct redox concentrations or depletions. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe C horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 through 4. It has faint or distinct redox concentrations or depletions. Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand in the fine earth fraction. It is single grain and loose or very friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 4. It has faint or distinct redox concentrations or depletions.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family.\nThe Covert, Covertfalls, Gratten, Melita, Menominee, Ocqueoc, and Yalmer series are in related families. The Covert and Gratten soils do not have contrasting loamy textures within the series control section. The Covertfalls soils have a mesic temperature regime. Melita soils are sands overlying loamy deposits at depths greater than 40 inches. The Menominee and Yalmer soils are underlain by loamy material with argillic horizons. Ocqueoc soils have less than 5 percent rock fragments in the solum and lack rock fragments in the substratum. They also have redder hues in the substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They are usually on slightly convex slopes or undulating landforms of outwash plains and old glacial lake shorelines. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 38 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F, and the mean frost-free season ranges from 100 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 200 to 1000 feet above sea level."

Adams, Croghan, Bice, Schroon, and Kalurah soils are also associated. The Adams and Croghan soils are on similar landscapes, but do not have a loamy substratum within a 60 inch depth. The Bice, Schroon and Kalurah soils usually occur on smoother slopes and have loamy textures throughout."

Not all items were reviewed at this time.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1) Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\n2) Spodic horizon - from a depth of 6 to 13 inches\n(Bs1 and Bs2 horizons).\n3) Aquentic subgroup - redoximorphic features within 30\ninches of the soil surface, sandy PSC.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
