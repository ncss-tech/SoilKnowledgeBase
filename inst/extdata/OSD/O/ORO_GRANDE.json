    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arbol (NM), Faraway (AZ) and Seralin (NV) series. Arbol soils do not have a Bk horizon and have a paralithic contact above the lithic contact. Faraway soils are neutral to moderately acid. Seralin soils are derived from limestone and are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30) and receive most of their precipitation in the winter."

The parent materials are fine grained mixed igneous materials consisting mainly of rhyolite and andesite.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 57 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The frost free season is 150 to 180 days."
