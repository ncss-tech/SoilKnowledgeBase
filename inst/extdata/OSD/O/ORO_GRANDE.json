  "OVERVIEW": "The Oro Grande series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from rhyolite and andesite.  Oro Grande soils are on rocky ridges and sideslopes of mountainous foothills.  Slopes are 3 to 55 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

Faraway soils are neutral to moderately acid. Seralin soils are derived from limestone and are in the Mohave Desert (MLRA 30) and receive most of their precipitation in the winter."

The parent materials are fine grained mixed igneous materials consisting mainly of rhyolite and andesite.  The climate is semiarid.  The mean annual temperature is about 45 to 57 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The frost free season is 150 to 180 days."
