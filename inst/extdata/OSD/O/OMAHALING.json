The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The mollic epipedon is 15 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to mottling with chroma of 2 or less is 15 to 30 inches.  Below the mollic epipedon organic matter decreases irregular with depth.  The particle-size control section averages 30 to 60 percent sand and 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 moist, 4 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent rounded gravel.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  It contains 0 to 25 percent gravel.  It has common distinct or prominent mottles.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam with strata of sand.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 1 or 2 dry.  It contains 60 to 80 percent gravel, 5 to 15 percent cobbles and 65 to 95 percent total coarse fragments."
