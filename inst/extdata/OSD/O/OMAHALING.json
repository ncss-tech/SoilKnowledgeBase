Depth to mottling with chroma of 2 or less is 15 to 30 inches.  Below the mollic epipedon organic matter decreases irregular with depth.  The particle-size control section averages 30 to 60 percent sand and 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 moist, 4 dry and chroma of 2 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 10 percent rounded gravel.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 moist and 1 or 2 dry.  It contains 0 to 25 percent gravel.  It has common distinct or prominent mottles.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam with strata of sand.
