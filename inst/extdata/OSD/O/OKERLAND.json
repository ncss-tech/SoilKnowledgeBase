  "OVERVIEW": "The Okerland series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from igneous and sedimentary rocks. Okerland soils are on fan skirts and alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
