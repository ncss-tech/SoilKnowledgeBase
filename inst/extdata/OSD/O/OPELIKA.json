  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 44 inches.  Depth to secondary carbonates ranges from 16 to 30 inches.  Clay content of the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon averages 29 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon is dark gray (10YR 4/1), gray (10YR 5/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or loam.  It is massive and hard when dry.  Some pedons have weak subangular structure when moist. Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 1 to 6 and soil salinity is less than 2 mmhos/cm.   Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B21t horizon is dark gray (10YR 4/1), gray (10YR 5/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) sandy clay, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Some pedons have B21t horizons of sandy clay or clay loam with more than 35 percent clay that are less than 10 inches thick.  Prism tops are commonly slightly rounded and capped with a thin sandy layer.  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 1 to 6 and the soil salinity is less than 2 mmhos/cm.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B22t and B23t horizons are dark gray (10YR 4/1), gray (10YR 5/1), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Soil salinity increases slightly with depth but is less than 4 mmhos/cm.  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from about 2 to 10.  Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline.  Few to common soft bodies and fine concretions occur in the lower part of the B22t and in the B23t horizon.\nThe C horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1), light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), light gray (10YR 7/2), white (10YR 8/2), or pale brown (10YR 6/3) sandy clay loam or clay loam.  It contains few to common soft bodies and concretions of calcium carbonate."

Anahuac, Arol, Edna, Falba, Hasse, Mabank, Parrons, and Taloka soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section and have average annual soil temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  Emeraldo and Telferner soils have more than 35 percent clay in their control sections.  Orelia soils do not have an abrupt texture change between the A and Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Opelika soils occupy nearly level, slightly concave, weakly expressed drainageways and nearly level low terraces on uplands adjacent to the drainageways.  Slopes are less than 1.0 percent.   The soil formed in clayey and loamy marine sediments like those of the Lissie and Beaumont formation.  The mean annual temperature is 70 degrees to 75 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches and the Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 24 to 40."

All these soils except Edroy, Orelia, and Papagua soils lack an aquic moisture regime. Clareville and Lattas soils occur on adjoining plains and have more than 35 percent clay in their control sections.  Edroy, Papagua, and Racombes soils are in slightly depressed areas and Edroy and Papagua soils have more than 35 percent clay in their control Sections.  Czar and Delfina soils are on slightly adjoining plains.  Czar soils have a mollic epipedon.  Delfina soils have a thicker, lighter colored A horizon and mottled Bt horizons."
