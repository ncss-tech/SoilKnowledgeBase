  "OVERVIEW": "The Orif series consists of very deep, well drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in calcareous stratified sandy and gravelly alluvium derived from limestone.  The soils occur in nearly level to very gently sloping flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 787 mm (31 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 20.0 degrees C (68 degrees F).",
