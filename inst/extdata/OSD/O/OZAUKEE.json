  "OVERVIEW": "The Ozaukee series consists of moderately well drained soils that are moderately deep or deep to a densic contact with till (Cd). They formed in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess and in the underlying dense till on ground and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 950 mm (37.4 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 9.7 degrees C (49.5 degrees F).",
