Where the silty clay loam till of the Ozaukee borders on reddish clay drift, the well drained and moderately well drained Kewaunee and somewhat poorly drained Manawa soils occur. The well drained Theresa and Hochheim soils are nearby where the silty clay loam till borders on till with a loam texture."

Refer to Soil Survey Sample numbers 58WI059003 and 58WI101004 for data sampled as Morley which now correlates to Ozaukee. All four pedons are also in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 17 on pages 112-115 and 144-147. Also refer to Lab Pedon Numbers 63IL043001, 68IL043001, and 77IL019032 for additional NSSC-KSSL data.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
