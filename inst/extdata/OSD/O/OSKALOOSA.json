Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nSome pedons have a BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Silt coatings on the faces of peds are dominantly in the upper part of the Bt horizon and range from gray to white.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.

Prisms, polygons, or other structural units commonly have horizontal dimensions of less than 4 inches in diameter in the upper part, but very coarse structure below a depth of 40 inches is typical.\nThe 2BC, or 2BCg, where present within 80 inches, have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid. It is silty clay loam, silt loam or loam. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe 3Agb or 3Btgb horizon, where present within 80 inches, has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 1 or 2.

Oskaloosa soils formed in 30 to 55 inches of loess and the silty or loamy deposits (pedisediment) thought to be of early Wisconsin age.  Some pedons are underlain, within 80 inches, by a Sangamon age paleosol developed in Illinoisan age diamicton. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches. The frost-free days range from 180 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 350 to 700 feet above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Ava soils, somewhat poorly drained Bluford soils and the poorly drained Wynoose soils are in a drainage sequence with Oskaloosa soils.  Ava soils are on nearby side slopes and convex crests. The Bluford soils have lower chroma matrix colors in the upper part of the series control section and are on nearly level areas and toeslopes adjacent to Oskaloosa soils. Wynoose soils are on broad nearly level parts of the till plain.  The well-drained Hickory soils are fine-loamy and are on side slopes below Oskaloosa soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Hoyleton soils are mollic intergrades and are on similar nearby ridges. The well drained Parke soils are on higher convex ridges nearby."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 14 inches (Ap and E horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from 14 to 66 inches ( the Bt and 2Btx horizons);\nfragic properties - the zone from 44 to 80 inches (2Btx and 2Bx horizons)\nThe Oskaloosa series is established to replace Bluford soils in gently sloping and moderately sloping areas where the water table is slightly lower in the profile and the soils do not classify as Aqualfs.   Oskaloosa series also recognizes the  \"fragic\" properties that are common in these soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of Illinois and NSSL data is available on supporting pedons at the NRCS state office.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
