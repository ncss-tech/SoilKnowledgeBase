  "OVERVIEW": "The Oskaloosa series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on shoulders of hillslopes and knolls.  They formed in loess and the underlying silty or loamy sediments.  Permeability is moderately slow or slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 7 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

Some pedons are underlain, within 80 inches, by a Sangamon age paleosol developed in Illinoisan age diamicton. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches. The frost-free days range from 180 to 200 days. Elevation ranges from 350 to 700 feet above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Ava soils, somewhat poorly drained Bluford soils and the poorly drained Wynoose soils are in a drainage sequence with Oskaloosa soils.  Ava soils are on nearby side slopes and convex crests. The Bluford soils have lower chroma matrix colors in the upper part of the series control section and are on nearly level areas and toeslopes adjacent to Oskaloosa soils. Wynoose soils are on broad nearly level parts of the till plain.  The well-drained Hickory soils are fine-loamy and are on side slopes below Oskaloosa soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Hoyleton soils are mollic intergrades and are on similar nearby ridges. The well drained Parke soils are on higher convex ridges nearby."

Oskaloosa series also recognizes the  \"fragic\" properties that are common in these soils.\nADDITIONAL DATA: University of Illinois and NSSL data is available on supporting pedons at the NRCS state office.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
