It is 15 to 25 percent gravel.  Some pedons have a BA horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, and has mottles of value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6 moist.  It is very gravelly clay loam, and is 27 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent gravel and cobbles.\nThe C horizon is distinctly or prominently mottled and highly variegated.
