The control section averages between 14 and 18 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is 6 to 10 inches thick.\nThe E, Eb, or BE horizon has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Platy structure, not always evident, is medium or coarse.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Sand size in the Bt horizon dominantly is fine or very fine.\nSome pedons have 2BC horizons that are similar to the Bt horizon.\nThe C horizon is sand or loamy sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Brady, Dixboro, and Wasepi series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Bronson, Matherton, Poseyville, and Ulster series.  Brady soils contain up to 25 percent by volume of coarse fragments throughout the control section.  Dixboro soils are underlain at depths less than 40 inches by stratified very fine sand and silt loam and contain free carbonates within depths of 40 inches.  Wasepi soils have thinner sola and free carbonates within a depth of 40 inches.  Bronson soils have a lighter colored surface layer and do not have low chroma mottles in the upper 4 to 8 inches of the argillic horizon.  Matherton soils are fine-loamy.  Poseyville soils have thinner sola and calcareous till within a depth of 3 feet.  Ulster soils do not have low chroma mottles in the upper part of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oakton soils formed in loamy and sandy eolianand water deposited material on nearly level glaciated uplands.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent.  Many areas are downslope from other coarse-loamy soils that occur on low, mound- or dune-like areas.  Mean annual temperature ranges from about 44 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 28 to 34 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bolan, Clyde, Dickinson, Klinger, Maxfield, Oran, and Readlyn soils.  Bolan, Dickinson, and Ulster soils typically are upslope from Oakton soils and have better drainage.  Bolan and Dickinson soils also have thicker A horizons.  Clyde, Klinger, Maxfield, Oran, and Readlyn soils are medium textured, and all except Oran soils have a thicker A horizon.  They typically are downslope or adjacent to Oakton soils on the landscape."
