  "OVERVIEW": "The Origo series consists of very deep, well drained  moderately rapidly permeability on mountainsides and summits.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from rhyolite and tuff.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
