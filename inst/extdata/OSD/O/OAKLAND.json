Depth to soft bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay.  Most of the fragments are crushable.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent hard and 0 to 20 percent soft weathered gravel.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent hard and 0 to 30 percent soft weathered gravel and cobbles.  Sand and silt coatings are common in the upper B horizon, averaging 35 to 45 percent clay.\nThe BCt horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 15 to 40 percent soft weathered rock fragments and 10 to 25 percent hard gravel.  It is gravelly silty clay of silty clay."

The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sandstone, siltstone and shale.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. and the annual precipitation is 30 to 60 inches. The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."
