(A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 4 to 20 cm. (Bk horizon)\nGypsic horizon:  The zone from 20 to 60 cm.  (By and CBy horizons)\nParalithic contact:  The contact with weathered shale at 60 cm.  (Cr horizon)\nWhile individual subhorizons may contain up to 25 percent gypsum, the mineralogy control section averages 5 to 15 percent gypsum.  More soil sampling and/or lab sampling are needed to more accurately define the mineralogy.\nThe assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomic Version:  Eleventh edition, 2010\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
