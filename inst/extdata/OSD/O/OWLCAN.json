  "OVERVIEW": "The Owlcan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous, moderately fine or fine alluvium.  Owlcan soils are on gently sloping to steep fans and mountain sides.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 32 degrees F.",
