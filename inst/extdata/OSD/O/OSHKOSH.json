  "OVERVIEW": "The Oshkosh series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in a thin mantle of loess or other silty deposits and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits on stream terraces and on basins of glacial lakes. Slope ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches). Mean annual air temperature is about 8.3 degrees C (47 degrees F).",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Oshkosh was formerly a part of the old Superior series.  The Superior series is now held to the Spodosol region of northern Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota.\n12/04  495 acres correlated as a loamy substratum phase in Brown County have stratified silts and fine sands at a depth of 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). New series needed?\n12/04 A total of 43,742 acres has been correlated in 3 surveys. In 2 of these surveys, representing 42,247 of the correlated acres, the typical pedon is well drained. Therefore, this revision changes the concept of the series to well drained only and provides a new typical pedon which is well drained. A new series (Oxyaquic Hapludalf) will be needed for the moderately well drained acres when they are updated.\nLab data is needed (Cole) to determine if this soil is in a Vertic subgroup.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - 0 to 25 cm (0 to 10 inches) (Ap); argillic horizon - 25 to 71 cm (10 to 28 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3);"
