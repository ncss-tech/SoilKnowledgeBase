The soil is medium to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has moist value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or sandy loam. The B horizon has moist value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It contains distinct or prominent yellowish brown, strong brown, or yellowish red mottles.\nThe C horizon has moist chroma of 2 or 3 and has distinct or prominent yellowish red or strong brown mottles.  Boulders, stones, and cobbles are common."
