The soil is medium to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has moist value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or sandy loam. The B horizon has moist value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It contains distinct or prominent yellowish brown, strong brown, or yellowish red mottles.\nThe C horizon has moist chroma of 2 or 3 and has distinct or prominent yellowish red or strong brown mottles.  Boulders, stones, and cobbles are common."

The description of the Labounty series is old (1944) and inadequate for satisfactory differentiation."
