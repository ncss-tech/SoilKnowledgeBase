  "OVERVIEW": "The Olephant series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying paleosol in lacustrine deposits. The Olephant soils are on dissected lake plains. Slope ranges from 1 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",
