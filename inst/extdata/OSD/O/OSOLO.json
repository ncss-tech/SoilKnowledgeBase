Acquango, Aldo, Bigapple, Caesar, Chute, Dabney, Hodge, Pahuk, Penwood, Perks, Pinegrove, Poquonock, Ronda, Sardak, Scotah, Spessard, Suncook, Wapanucket, and Windsor soils are less than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of soil development. Biltmore soils have mica flakes throughout the series control section. Boplain soils have a paralithic contact between 51 and 102 cm (20 and 40 inches). Breeze soils contains 10 percent construction debris that behaves similarly to rock fragments. Oakville, Plainfield, and Sarpy soils average less than 10 percent silt plus clay in the particle-size control section. Samoa soils do not have a Bw horizon. Tyner soils average less than 50 percent fine and very fine sand in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Osolo soils are on swells on outwash terraces and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Osolo soils formed in sandy sediments of mixed lithology. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 1016 mm (32 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 130 to 180 days. Elevation is 177 to 311 meters (580 to 1,020 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "REMARKS: Series was developed to replace soils mapped as Tyner, wet substratum in the Elkhart County soil survey update.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap).\nRedoximorphic features: present in horizons below a depth of 122 cm (48 inches).\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 124293 represents the typical pedon.\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 124294 represents the 1 to 5 percent slope phase.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data for the typical pedon (S90IN-039-005) is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE. Transect data for the typical pedon (T90IN-039-017) is on file at the MLRA office in Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 95 percent Osolo soils and 5 percent Coloma soils.\nA study was conducted within the map unit of the type location using ground penetrating radar (GPR). At the time of the study the GPR showed the water table to be between 71 and 92 inches and that it generally occurred about 20 inches below the upper boundary of redoximorphic features. There are water table monitoring pipes with attached data loggers. Data has been gathered for about 2 years and shows that the water table ranges from 54.4 to 88.2 inches below the surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
