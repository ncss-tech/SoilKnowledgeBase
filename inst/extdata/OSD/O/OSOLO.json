Biltmore soils have mica flakes throughout the series control section. Boplain soils have a paralithic contact between 51 and 102 cm (20 and 40 inches). Breeze soils contains 10 percent construction debris that behaves similarly to rock fragments. Oakville, Plainfield, and Sarpy soils average less than 10 percent silt plus clay in the particle-size control section. Samoa soils do not have a Bw horizon. Tyner soils average less than 50 percent fine and very fine sand in the particle-size control section."

Transect data for the typical pedon (T90IN-039-017) is on file at the MLRA office in Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 95 percent Osolo soils and 5 percent Coloma soils.\nA study was conducted within the map unit of the type location using ground penetrating radar (GPR). At the time of the study the GPR showed the water table to be between 71 and 92 inches and that it generally occurred about 20 inches below the upper boundary of redoximorphic features. There are water table monitoring pipes with attached data loggers. Data has been gathered for about 2 years and shows that the water table ranges from 54.4 to 88.2 inches below the surface.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
