  "OVERVIEW": "The Oryx series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that formed in calcareous alluvium.  Permeability is moderately slow .  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on inset fans of fan piedmonts.  Slope ranges from 1 to 5 percent slopes. Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
