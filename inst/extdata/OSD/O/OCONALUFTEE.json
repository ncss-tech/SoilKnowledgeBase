  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The soil is extremely acid to strongly acid in the A horizon, and ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the other horizons.  Content of mica flakes ranges from few to common.  Content of rock fragments ranges up to 35 percent.  They are dominantly of channer or flagstone size.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe AB horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has the same textures as the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon, and BC horizon if present, have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  They are loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon is saprolite weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as thinly bedded metasandstone, quartzite, phyllite, and slate.  It is multicolored or variable in color and is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Breakneck, Burton, Cataloochee, Guyot, Tanasee, and Wayah series. Breakneck soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Burton and Wayah soils formed in residuum and Tanasee in colluvium from high-grade metamorphic rocks and contain fragments of those rocks. Cataloochee and Guyot soils have paralithic contacts at depths of 20 to 40 and 40 to 60 inches repectively. Tanasee and Wayah soils have bedrock at depths greater than 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oconaluftee soils are on strongly sloping to very steep side slopes and ridge tops in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  Elevation ranges from about 4,800 to 6,400 feet.  On north and east aspects this soil may occur at somewhat lower elevations.  Slope is commonly between 20 and 75 percent, but ranges from 8 to 95 percent.  Oconaluftee soils formed in residuum  that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and is weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks such as thinly bedded metasandstone, quartzite, slate, and phyllite.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches near the type location.  Moist atmospheric conditions are prevalent and fog is common in these high mountain areas."

Chiltoskie, Heintooga, and Horsetrough soils formed in colluvium. Heintooga soils are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. Horsetrough soils are in a sandy-skeletal particle-size class and are poorly drained. Clingman and Pinnacle soils are comprised of organic soil material. Pullback soils formed in residuum and have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches. Cataloochee soils have paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Nearly all of this soil is in forest.  Common trees are northern red oak, black oak, American beech, yellow birch, black cherry, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, and yellow buckeye.  In areas higher than 5,400 feet, red spruce and fraser fir are the dominant tree species.  In many areas the trees are stunted due to wind and ice damage and a \"windswept phase\" is recognized.  The understory species are serviceberry, striped maple, American chestnut sprouts,  pin cherry, rhododendron, mountain-laurel, silverbell, blueberry, and flame azalea.  Common forbs are hay-scented fern, wood fern, New York fern, Solomon's seal, yellow mandarin, and trillium.  A small acreage is covered by heath balds vegetated with rhododendron, flame azalea, blueberry, hawthorn, and mountain ash."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Oconaluftee series was formerly included with the Burton and Porters series.  However, Burton soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches below the surface, and Porters soils are mesic.  Also, Burton and Porters soils formed from residuum weathered from felsic and high-grade metamprhic rocks such as granite, hornblende gneiss, and mica gneiss and contains fragments of those rocks.\nThe Oconaluftee series has the following diagnostic horizons:\nUmbric epipedon - The zone from the mineral surface to 19 inches (Al and A2 Horizons.)\nCambic horizon - The zone from 19 to 35 inches below the surface (Bw horizon).\nRevised  02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
