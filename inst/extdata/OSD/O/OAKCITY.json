Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry or 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  Texture is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bw and C horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry or 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Conductivity of the saturation extract is 2 to 8 millimhos/cm, but may range as high as 16 millimhos/cm below a depth of 50 inches.  Reaction is moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline. The Bw horizons don't meet the definition of a cambic."
