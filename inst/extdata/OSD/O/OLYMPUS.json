The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers and cool winters. Most precipitation comes in the winter but in some areas it is sporadic. The mean annual precipitation is 2 to 6 inches. The mean annual temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. Mean July temperature is about 78 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 42 degrees F. The frost-free season is 240 to 340 days."
