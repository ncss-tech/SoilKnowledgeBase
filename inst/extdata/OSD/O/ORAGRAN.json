  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oragran soils are on mountain slopes and ridges. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 55 to 1575 meters (180 to 3500 feet). The soils formed in material weathered from serpentine or serpentinized peridotite. The climate is humid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 2286 to 3050 millimeters (90 to 120 inches). Mean January temperature is 3 degrees C (37 degrees F.), and mean July temperature is 17 degrees C (63 degrees F.). Mean annual temperature is 9 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). Frost-free season is estimated to be about 100 to 180 days."

Gasquet soils are in concave to linear positions and are on more stable positions on mountain slopes. Jayel and Weitchepec soils are on convex to strongly convex positions. Walnett soils are on concave to linear positions on mountain slopes."
