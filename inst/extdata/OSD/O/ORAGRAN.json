  "OVERVIEW": "The Oragran series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in material weathered from peridotite or serpentinite. Oragran soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 2870 milimeters (113 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
