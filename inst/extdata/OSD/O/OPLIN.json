  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to limestone bedrock ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The control section contains from 35 to 80 percent fragments of limestone that are mostly less than 10 inches across the long axis.\nThe A and Bk horizons have hue of 7.5YR and 10YR, values of 3 through 5, and chromas of 2 or 3.  The fine-earth fraction is loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam with a clay content of 20 to 35 percent.  Coarse fragments range from 15 to 65 percent in the A horizon and from 50 to 80 percent in the Bk horizon. Most fragments in the Bk horizon have pendants of calcium carbonate on the lower side.  Calcium carbonate content ranges from 10 to 30 percent in the fine-earth fraction and total calcium carbonate content is 40 to 60 percent.\nThe R layer is indurated limestone.  It is layered and fractured and has secondary calcium carbonate coatings in the upper part."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aledo, Altuda, Ector, and Lueders series.  A similar soil is the Langtry series.  Aledo, Altuda, Ector and Langtry soils are dry in the control section for longer periods of time.  In addition, Langtry soils are in the hyperthermic family.  Lueders soils occur in areas with slightly cooler temperatures, have different rangeland vegetation, and formed mainly from limestones of Permian origin."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oplin soils are on convex limestone ridgetops and breaks of erosional uplands.  Slopes are mainly 1 to 15 percent, but some are as much as 40 percent.  These soils formed in residuum over indurated limestone of the Cretaceous period.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 30 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 70 degrees F.  Frost free days ranges from 210 to 235 days, and elevation ranges from 1,200 to 2,400 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 32 to 44"

Brackett soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section and are on hillsides.  Hext and Nuvalde soils have sola more than 20 inches thick.  In addition, the Hext soils are on upland ridges and Nuvalde soils are in valleys.  Kavett soils are on divides.  Speck soils occur on nearly level and gently sloping areas and have clayey Bt horizons.  Tarrant soils have more than 35 percent clay on similar positions.  Valera soils are on divides, are more clayey, have less than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section, and have sola more than 20 inches thick."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Oplin series was proposed for soils previously considered part the Ector series.  These soils are in more moist areas with over 20 inches annual precipitation.  Oplin differs from Leuders by some chemical differences not yet measured, because there is a difference in vegetation types, especially woody species.\nThe series is in the active cation exchange activity class.  Diagnostic horizons or features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - 0 to 9 inches.  (A and Bk horizons)\nCalcic horizon - 3 to 9 inches.  (Bk horizon)\nLithic contact - at 9 inches.\nSoil Interpretation Record No:  TX0890\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
