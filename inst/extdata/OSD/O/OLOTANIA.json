Slope is dominantly 15 to 40 percent, and as steep as 70 percent along drainageways and on ridges, and cinder cones. These soils formed in volcanic ash and cinders. Elevation is 900 to 3,000 feet. The mean annual rainfall is 200 to 300 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 74 to 78 degrees F. Fog and cloud cover are common."
