The silt plus clay content of the 10 to 40 inch zone is 5 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where the value is 2 or 3, it is less than 10 inches thick.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5GY, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, and gray range from none to common.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand; and in the lower Cg horizons, can include coarse sand.  Most pedons have thin strata of material ranging from sand to sandy loam.\nIn some pedons, the C horizon is underlain or interrupted by an Ab horizon.  It has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand."

Albany, Blanton, Lynchburg, Ocilla, Paxville, Pelham, and Rains soils have argillic horizons.  Bibb and Ochlockonee soils have more than 15 percent silt plus clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  In addition, Ochlockonee soils are well drained.  The somewhat poorly to moderately well drained Chipley soils are on higher adjacent uplands.  The moderately well drained Echaw soils are on higher adjacent positions.  The excessively drained Kershaw and Lakeland soils are on higher adjacent uplands.  The very poorly drained Johnston, Pickney, and Rutlege soils are on lower positions and have umbric epipedons."
