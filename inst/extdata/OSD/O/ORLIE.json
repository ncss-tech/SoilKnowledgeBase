Potential competitors that do not yet have CEA class assigned are the Augustine, Bigbow, Carri (T), Celacy, Dermala, Goesling, Lykorly, Maia, Nyjack, Pinitos, and Ribera series. Arnor soils have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Augustine, Flugle, Parkelei and Pinitos series have more than 35 percent sand in the particle-size control section.  Bigbow soils have buried paleosol horizons.  Bosonoak soils have hue redder than 7.5YR. Carri, Celavar, Celacy, Evpark, Gateson, Nyjack and Ribera soils have a lithic or paralithic contact within 40 inch depths. Dermala soils have igneous or metamorphic parent material. Goesling and Maia soils have calcic horizons and will reclassify in the Calcidic subgroup. Iwela soils have a skeletal discontinuity within 40 inches. Lykorly soils have annual soil temperature of 54 to 56 degrees F.  The Arwite, Bigbow, Dalhart, Deekay, Elwop, Fort Collins, Oldwolf, Olnest, Rauzi, Rockybutte, Stoneham, Toluca, and Wagonhound soils are in LRR-E or LRR-G soils and are more moist in May and June."
