  "OVERVIEW": "The Otroizo series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in stream alluvium dominated by rhyolite tuff.  Otroizo soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
