  "OVERVIEW": "The Olaton series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils with moderately rapid permeability that formed in colluvium and alluvium from granitic rocks. Slopes range from 4 to 90 percent in foothills and canyons. The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
