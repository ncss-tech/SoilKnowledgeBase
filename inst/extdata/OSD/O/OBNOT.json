  "OVERVIEW": "The Obnot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are formed in alluvium derived from quartzite.  They are on mountain footslopes and fan terraces.  Slopes are 4 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.  The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
