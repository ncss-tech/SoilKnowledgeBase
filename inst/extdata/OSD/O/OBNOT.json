Bagval soils have argillic horizons and have mollic epipedons that are 30 to 60 inches thick.  Frenchollow soils do not have secondary carbonates within 39 inches of the soil surface and have clay films in the cambic horizon.  Hawkins soils are dry for less than 80 days.  Obray soils have mollic epipedons more than 30 inches thick."
