    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Occidental soils were classified as fine, mixed superactive, nonacid, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts in 2001 based on changes in Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Ninth edition. HOBO temperature data recorded 2001 to 2004 indicates moisture in the very poorly drained areas moderates the soil temperatures so that mean summer and mean winter temperatures differ by 6 degrees C or less.  These soils are reclassified as fine, mixed, superactive, nonacid, isomesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters. (Oi and Az horizons)\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 30 to 160 centimeters. (Bzg1, Bzg2 horizons)\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone between 25 and 100 centimeters (Bng1, Bng2) averages 36 percent clay.\n4. Aquept suborder - In the layer directly beneath the epipedon, there is chroma of 2 and redox concentrations from 8 to 160 centimeters.\n5. Fluvaquentic subgroup - An irregular decrease in organic-carbon content between a depth of 25 and 125 centimeters below the mineral soil surface."
