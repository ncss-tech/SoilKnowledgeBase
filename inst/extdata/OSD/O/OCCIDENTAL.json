Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters.  The mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Occidental soils were classified as fine, mixed superactive, nonacid, mesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts in 2001 based on changes in Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Ninth edition. HOBO temperature data recorded 2001 to 2004 indicates moisture in the very poorly drained areas moderates the soil temperatures so that mean summer and mean winter temperatures differ by 6 degrees C or less.  These soils are reclassified as fine, mixed, superactive, nonacid, isomesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters. (Oi and Az horizons)\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 30 to 160 centimeters. (Bzg1, Bzg2 horizons)\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone between 25 and 100 centimeters (Bng1, Bng2) averages 36 percent clay.\n4. Aquept suborder - In the layer directly beneath the epipedon, there is chroma of 2 and redox concentrations from 8 to 160 centimeters.\n5. Fluvaquentic subgroup - An irregular decrease in organic-carbon content between a depth of 25 and 125 centimeters below the mineral soil surface.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NASIS User Pedon ID: 90CA600614\nOriginal location was re-described 4/5/2001 for Field Review May 2001. Electrical Conductivity values are from Typical pedon location samples analyzed at Humboldt State University Soil Lab by Soil Survey staff on 5/15/2001.  Original location was re-described 4/5/2001 for Field Review May 2001.\nSoil-Vegetation Survey sample number s64-CA12-008 Bayside silty clay is supporting data collected in this area, from a description for the Soils of Western Humboldt County, California.\nSoil classified using Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
