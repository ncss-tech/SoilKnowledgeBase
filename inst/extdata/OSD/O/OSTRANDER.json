  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ostrander series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 75 to 150 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and in the underlying till. These soils are on summits, side slopes, or shoulder slopes on dissected till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 910 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
