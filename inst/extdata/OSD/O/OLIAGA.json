  "OVERVIEW": "The Oliaga series consists of moderately deep over sand and gravel, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived mainly from acid igneous rocks.  Oliaga soils are on alluvial fans and bottom lands and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F., and the average summer temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 65 to 74 degrees F.  The profile ranges from mildly to strongly alkaline.  The soil is somewhat saline in some pedons.  A saturation extract of this soil above 40 inches has an electrical conductivity of 1 mmhos per centimeter or greater.\nThe A horizon and upper part of the C horizon are moderately or slightly calcareous (5 to 14 percent carbonates), and the lower part of the soil is commonly slightly calcareous or noncalcareous (1 to 5 percent carbonates).  A layer of loose sand and/or gravel has its upper boundary at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  The organic matter is estimated to be 1 to 3 percent and decreases regularly with depth to less than 0.35 percent above the sand and gravel.\nThe Ap or the A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 1.\nThe C horizons have a hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 2.  Faint or distinct mottles with chroma of 2 or 3 occur."
