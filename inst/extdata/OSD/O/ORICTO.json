  "OVERVIEW": "The Oricto series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from rhyolite, andesite and granodiorite.  Oricto soils are on fan remnants, fan piedmonts and beach plains.   Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 100 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
