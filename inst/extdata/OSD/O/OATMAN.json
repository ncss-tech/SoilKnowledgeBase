The soil moisture control section is dry for 30 to 45 consecutive days.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Depth to an indurated duripan is 40 to over 60 inches. Rock fragments are subrounded. The particle-size control section has 35 to 65 percent rock fragments.  It is medial loam or medial sandy loam and averages 15 to 27 percent clay.  The solum is slightly or moderately acid.  The base saturation is 35 to 60 percent in the solum.  Thickness of andic soil properties is 40 to over 60 inches.  The zone having andic soil properties consists of acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron of 3 to 5 percent, phosphate retention of 75 to 100 and 15 to 30 percent glass.
