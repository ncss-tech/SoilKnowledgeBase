  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 4 to 8 feet. Depth to the fragipan ranges from about 13 to 42 inches. Typically, these soils contain less than 10 percent sand which is mainly very fine sand. Grayish iron depletions caused by wetness are within 10 inches of the top of the argillic horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. In some pedons the E horizon is mottled with strong brown or gray. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. In some pedons, the Bt horizon has reddish mottles. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Btx horizon and the Btx part of the Btx/E horizon have value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. The E material in the B/E horizon has value of 5 to 7 and chroma of 2 or 3. In the lower part of the Btx horizon, the vertical streaks are silty clay loam 1/2 to 1 inch wide. The streaks have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction of the Btx horizon typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid, but it ranges to neutral in some pedons."

Other competing series are the Bryson, Bude, Coteau, Dulac, Edisto, Grenada, Jay, Leverett, Longview, Loring, Providence, Splendora, and Tippo series. Bryson soils have an umbric epipedon. Bude soils have more than 10 percent fine sand and coarser in the upper 48 inches. Calloway soils have more than 15 percent albic intrusions throughout the argillic horizon above the fragipan. Coteau soils do not have a fragipan. Dulac, Loring, and Providence soils do not have aquic conditions or gray iron depletions in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Edisto soils are coarse-loamy. Grenada soils have a bisequum and do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 40 inches. Jay soils have a darker colored A horizon and do not have aquic conditions within a depth of 40 inches. Leverett and Tippo soils are coarse-silty and do not have a fragipan. Longview soils do not have a fragipan. Splendora soils are fine-loamy."

The soil formed in loess 4 to 20 feet thick under forest vegetation. The mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall is about 55 inches. Thornthwaite P-E index is about 70."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The classification of the Olivier series was changed from an Aquic Fragiudalf to an Aquic Fraglossudalf in 2002 and a glossic horizon was recognized in order to be more consistent with the description of the type location pedon and other survey area typical pedons. The series was also assigned to an active activity class. Diagnostic horizons and other significant features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 9 inches (Ap and E horizons).\nAlbic horizon: 6 to 9 inches (E horizon).\nArgillic horizon: 9 to 52 inches (Bt1, Bt2, Btx part of the B/E horizon, and the Btx horizons).\nGlossic Horizon: 30 to 37 inches (Btx/E horizon).\nFragipan: 30 to 52 inches (Btx/E and Btx horizons.\nAquic conditions: Within 10 inches of the top of the argillic horizon, 15 to 19 inches (Bt2 horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: East Baton Rouge Parish Soil Survey. Laboratory data for type location is in the Lincoln Soil Survey Laboratory Report for Selected Samples (1961) from East Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana - Profile S61LA-17-1 under the name of Calloway silt loam.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
