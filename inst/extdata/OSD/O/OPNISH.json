  "OVERVIEW": "The Opnish series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  These soils are on alluvial fans. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
