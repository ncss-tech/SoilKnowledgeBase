The mollic epipedon is 8 to 20 inches thick. The 10 to 40 inch section is clay or silty clay. The soils are slightly to moderately calcareous at some depth above 30 inches and are moderately or strongly calcareous below 30 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 43 degrees to 47 inches F. at about 20 inches.  Cracks 1/2 inch to 2 inches wide extending to depths of 40 inches or more occur when the soils are dry. The cracks open and close once each year and remain open for 60 consecutive days or more in 7 out of 10 years.\nThe Al horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is noncalcareous to moderately calcareous and contains O to 20 percent carbonate content. This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR, value of 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It has common to many slickensides. This horizon is neutral to strongly alkaline and contains 3 to 30 percent lime. Cobble and shale fragments content ranges from O to 30 percent."
