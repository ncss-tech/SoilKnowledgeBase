  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to petrocalcic horizon ranges from 4 to 20 inches and commonly occurs within a single pedon.  Surface cover of coarse fragments ranges from 5 to 75 percent and is highly variable within the polypedon.  Soil reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Fragments, that are mostly caliche and limestone, average 35 to 85 percent by volume.  Some pedons contain a few chert fragments that are dominantly pebbles and cobbles.  Fragments larger than 10 inches comprise less than about 20 percent by volume.  The fine-earth fraction is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with a clay content of 22 to 40 percent and silicate clay content of 12 to 35 percent.\nThe Bkm horizon is strongly cemented or indurated in the upper 1/4 inch to 5 inches and weakly to strongly cemented below.\nThe BCk horizon is dominantly calcium carbonate in the fine earth fraction and contains 5 to 90 percent fragments of limestone, cemented caliche, and chert.  Clay content ranges from 5 to 35 percent."

Amistad and Zorra soils are underlain by limestone bedrock.  Boracho and Cho soils have mean annual temperatures less than 72 degrees F.  Jimenez soils contain less than 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  Valco soils contain less than 35 percent coarse fragments."

The soil formed in loamy alluvium from limestone areas.  Mean annual precipitation is 18 to 32 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 69 to 74 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 250 to 300.  Elevation ranges from 300 to 1200 feet.  Thornthwaite PE indices range from 25 to about 40"

These soils, except for Knippa soils, occur on similar surfaces.  Knippa soils occur at lower elevation in valleys or on broad plains.  Knippa soils are more clayey, contain less than about 15 percent coarse fragments and have thicker sola of soft caliche.  Quemado and Zapata soils have a ochric epipedon.  Hindes and Yologo soils contain less than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used as  Native rangeland.  The native vegetation consists of mid and short grasses, about 10 percent woody plants and 5 percent forbs.  Guajillo is the dominant woody plant in most instances.  Important forbs are bushsunflower, menodora, and bundleflower.  With retrogression, common increasers and invaders are threeawn, slim tridens, Hall panicum, red grama, hairy tridens, cenizo, mesquite, and pricklypear cactus."
