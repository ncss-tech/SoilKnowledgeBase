  "OVERVIEW": "The Onionpie series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, somewhat excessively drained soils on ash flows.  These soils formed in ash flow derived from pumice and other volcanic rock.  Slopes are 2 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
