Some pedons are underlain by siltstone or sandstone bedrock below 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid.\nA thin E horizon is present in some pedons.  Color and reaction are the same as the A horizon.  Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Mottles in shades of gray or brown range from none to common.  Texture is clay, sandy clay, silty clay, or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.  Fragments of siltstone or sandstone range from 0 to 4 percent by volume.  The calcium-magnesium ratio is less than 1.\nThe C horizon has the same colors as the Bt horizon.  It is clay, silty clay, sandy clay, clay loam, silty clay loam, or sandy clay loam.  Fragments of soft sandstone or siltstone range from 0 to 4 percent by volume.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Colbert soils have very-fine lower Bt horizons and are underlain by limestone bedrock.  Eastwood soils have high aluminum saturation in the control section, and in addition commonly have browner subsoils.  Etoile soils are less acid and have calcium carbonate concretions in the lower part of the control section.  Kipling soils have a calcium-magnesium ratio of more than 1.0.  Lorman, Rayburn, Wilcox, and Woodtell soils have redder hue in the upper Bt horizon.  Boswell, Kirvin, and Susquehanna soils have redder hue and sola thicker than 60 inches.  Cadeville and Gore soils have redder hue and mixed mineralogy.  Iredell soils are less acid and do not form cracks.  Kisatchie soils have rock layers at depths of 20 to 40 inches below the surface.  Oktibbeha soils have very-fine control sections and calcium carbonate concretions in the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The parent material is acid clayey and loamy sediment of the Catahoula Formation.  The climate is warm and humid.  The mean average annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 60 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit."

Anacoco soils are on lower side slopes and are somewhat poorly drained.  Guyton soils are in drainageways, are poorly drained, and have fine-silty control sections.  Providence soils have fine-silty control sections and a fragipan.  Smithdale soils have fine-loamy control sections and reddish colors."

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils have developed in parent material which is reported in geological surveys as having abundant glass, pumice, and bentonite.  They were previously included with the Kisatchie series.  Colors of 2 chroma in the subsoil are interpreted to be relic colors of the parent material rather than wetness.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon.....0 to 2 inches (A horizon).\nArgillic horizon....2 to 43 inches (Bt horizon).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
