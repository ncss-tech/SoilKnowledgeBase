  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically, the soil is calcareous throughout but some pedons are noncalcareous in the upper 10 inches.  All horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6; hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 8; and hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  If this horizon is silty clay loam or has moist value and chroma of 3.5 or less, it is less and 10 inches thick.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6; hue of 5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The particle size control section is dominantly fine sandy loam, loam, loamy very fine sand, or very fine sandy loam with strata of finer or coarser material.  Below a depth of 40 inches, this horizon is dominantly loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam with strata of coarser or finer material."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oklared soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping flood plains of streams that carry sediments mainly from Permian and Pennsylvanian Age.  Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in calcareous loamy and sandy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 52 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 64 to 80.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Kiomatia and Severn series and the Coushatta, Idabel, Latanier, Norwood, Redlake, and Roebuck series.  Coushatta soils have a fine-silty control section and a cambic horizon.  Coushatta and Kiomatia soils are on adjacent flood plains that are lower in position and closer to the stream channel.  Idabel soils have a cambic horizon. Idabel, Norwood, and Severn soils are on similar topographic positions as Oklared soils.  Norwood soils have a fine-silty control section.  Latanier soils have a mollic epipedon and have a clayey over loamy control section.  Latanier, Redlake, and Roebuck soils are in the middle or back side of flood plains that are higher in topographic positions as Oklared soils.  Redlake and Roebuck soils have a fine control section and a COLE of more than 0.09.  In addition, Roebuck soils have a mollic epipedon and montmorillonitic mineralogy."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; negligible runoff; moderately rapid permeability.  This soil has endosaturation (apparent water table) below a depth of 40 inches of the surface most of the year and ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  These soils are rarely or commonly flooded for very brief periods mainly during January to July unless protected."
