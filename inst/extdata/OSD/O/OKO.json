  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonate ranges from 5 to 16 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches and extends into the Bt horizon.  The Bt horizon averages 40 to 60 percent clay.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  Pebbles and small stones, 1 to 12 inches in diameter, range from 0 to 15 percent by volume throughout the pedon and up to 60 percent by volume on the surface.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam or loam with analogs of gravelly to stony in some pedons.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam or clay and neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Few or common, fine through coarse accumulations of carbonate are mixed throughout the Btk and Bk horizons.   It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist; and chroma of 1 or 3.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has common fine to coarse accumulations of carbonate in some pedons.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Fragments of shale are in the C horizon and become more numerous with depth.  Bedded shale is between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Millboro, Okreek, and Witten series.  Millboro soils contain more silt and less sand and formed in clay sediments derived from shale.  Okreek soils have bedrock between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  Witten soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 20 inches thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Oko soils are on undulating to steep landscapes.  Slope gradients typically are 6 to 15 percent but range from 0 to 25 percent.  Surfaces are plane or convex.  The Oko soils formed in fine-textured, calcareous glacial till that contains many shale fragments.  The mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.   The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 21 inches."

Cavo, Demky, and Jerauld soils are on nearly level landscapes and have a natric horizon.  Gettys soils do not have an argillic horizon and are on convex slopes above the Oko soils.  The Hoven soils are in upland depressions and are wetter.  The Opal soils contain more clay and are on similar positions as the Oko soils. Peno and Raber soils crack less and are on similar positions."
