Elevations range from 4,700 to 5,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches with most of the precipitation coming in the winter months as snow.  The mean annual air temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer air temperature is 61 to 66 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 90 to 105 days."

Banida soils have more than 0.7 percent organic carbon in the surface horizon.  Yago soils are clayey-skeletal.  Manila soils have a mollic epipedon, an argillic horizon and hues of 7.5YR or yellower throughout the profile.  Ant Flat soils are along drainageways.  Banida soils are in concave areas and on north and east-facing slopes.  Manila and Yago soils are on fan remnants and foothills."
