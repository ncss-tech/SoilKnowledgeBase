  "OVERVIEW": "The Oxford series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits and alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Oxford soils are on dissected lake terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
