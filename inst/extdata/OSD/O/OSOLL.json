  "STATES": "NV,OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Osoll series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Osoll soils are on hills.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
