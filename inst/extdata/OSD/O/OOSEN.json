  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the volcanic ash mantle over the pyroclastic sands is 20 to 40 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F. The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from May 1 to November 10 and exceeds 47 degrees F from June 1 to October 20. The soil is dry between 10 and 36 inches from mid-July to mid-October and moist in all or some part the rest of the year. Rock fragments consist of gravel and cobbles and range from O to 15 percent in the particle size control section. The soil is neutral to medium acid. Base saturation ranges from 5 to 40 percent. The NaF pH ranges from 10.9 in the surface to 9.6 at depths of 40 to 72 inches. The particle size control section consists of 10 to 20 percent very coarse and coarse sands and 35 to 50 percent fine and very fine sands.\nThe A horizon is dark brown, dark grayish brown, grayish brown, pale brown, light brownish gray or liqht yellowish brown (10R 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4). Mois' color is very dark grayish brown, dark brown or dark yellowish brown (10R 3/2, 3/3, 3/4). It has dry value of 6 or moist chroma of 4 at depths of 4 to 10 inches in the lower part of the A horizon. It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe C1 horizon is brown, pale brown, yellowish brown and light yellowish brown or pinkish gray (10R S/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/2). Moist color is brown or dark yellowish brown (10R 3/4, 4/4; 7 5YR 4/4). It is loamy sand or loamy fine sand. It has very weak subangular blocky structure or is massive.\nThe IIC horizon is very dark gray, dark gray or dark brown (10R 3/1, 4/1, 4/3, 3/3). Moist color is black very dark brown, or very dark grayish brown (10R 2/1, 2/2, 3/2). The upper few inches commonly are cemented enough to be brittle but the brittle layer is discontinuous. In some pedons, multicolored bands or strata of volcanic sands are present."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oosen soils are on slopes of volcanic mountain peaks between lava flow ridges. Slopes are 2 to 50 percent. The soils formed in pyroclastic ashy materials deposited over unrelated pyroclastic sands. Elevations are 5,000 to 7,000 feet. The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 50 inches. Snowfall is 24 to 48 inches and covers the land at the higher elevations from late November to late March in most years. Mean January temperature is 23 to 28 degrees F; mean July temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F. Frost-free season is 35 to 60 days."
