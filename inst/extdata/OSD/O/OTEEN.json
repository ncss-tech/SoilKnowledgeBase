Depth to a lithic contact is more than 20 inches. The soil is very strongly acid to neutral. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the A and B horizons and from 0 to 40 percent in the C horizon. Content of mica flakes is few or common throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. A horizons that have value of 3 or less are less than 7 inches thick. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. In moderately eroded pedons, this horizon has colors similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has colors and textures similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 4 to 8, or it is multicolored. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon is multicolored, weathered, mixed felsic and mafic, high-grade metamorphic rock such as migmatitic gneiss, biotite-hornblende gneiss, and amphibolite. It is partially consolidated, but can be dug with difficulty with hand tools. The upper boundary is considered as a paralithic contact where root spacing is greater than 4 inches.\nThe R horizon, where present, is hard, mixed felsic and mafic, high-grade metamorphic rock such as migmatitic gneiss, biotite-hornblende gneiss, and amphibolite."

The slope gradient commonly is 15 to 50 percent but ranges from 8 to 95 percent. They formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and is weathered from mixed felsic and mafic, high-grade metamorphic rocks such as migmatitic gneiss, biotite-hornblende gneiss, and amphibolite. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 30 to 45 inches."

None of these soils have bedrock within 20 inches of the surface. Chestnut and Edneyville soils have less than 60 percent base saturation. Cowee, Evard, and Tate soils have argillic horizons and less than 35 percent base saturation. Marshill(T) soils are deep and Walnut(T) soils are moderately deep to bedrock. All these soils except for Tate are on mountain ridges and side slopes. Tate soils are on colluvial footslopes, fans and benches. The Mars Hill(T) and Walnut(T) soils are associated locally on the mountain landscape with Oteen soils."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The November 1992 revision of this series changed the classification from Ultic Hapludalfs to Dystric Eutrochrepts. This is based on characterization data from the typical pedon -NSSL Pedon Number 91P0226. A dominance of the soils mapped Oteen have a cambic horizon and have more than 60 percent base saturation by NH4OAc in some horizon between 10 inches and paralithic contact by 20 inches. The 8/01 revision updates classification and places this series in a superactive CEC activity class based upon NSSL Pedon 91P0226.\nDiagnostic features and horizons recognized in the typical pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 2 inches (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 2 to 11 inches below the surface (Bw horizon)\nShallow paralithic contact - the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 15 inches (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSelected NSSL data: NH4OAc\nHorizon Depth(in) Sand Silt Clay pH1:1H2O Base Sat.% CEC7\n------- --------- ---- ---- ---- ---------- --------\nAp 0 - 2 59.9 30.6 9.5 4.6 58\nBw 2 - 11 61.6 29.3 9.1 5.1 49\nC 11 - 15 71.8 20.8 7.4 6.0 76\nMLRA: 130 SIR: NC0107\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
