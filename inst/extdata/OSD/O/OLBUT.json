This is based on lab data of similar soils with similar clay contents in the area.\nThese soils have been previously recognized as an alkali phase of Butler soils.\n11/2005 JCR and LM Changed to semi-tab format, added metric conversion and saturated hydraulic conductivity.  Also, added z subscript to B horizons based on the two NSSL samples.\nOSD Modification 2/2012 DJK\nEdited climate data in introduction and geomorphic setting to fit series extent.\nChanged classification from Abruptic Argiaquolls to Vertic Argiaquolls because vertic falls out before abruptic in Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nAdded elevation to typical pedon.\nAdded the z horizon suffix to the horizons in the typical pedon that describe salt accumulations.\nIn RIC edited mollic thickness, added depth to argillic, added depth to salt, added depth to episaturation, and PSCS info. For horizons added clay, sand, EC, and SAR. Also populated redox using pedon data and added 3 to value for Ap and Bt horizons. Deleted silt loam as possible texture for BCz.\nEdited Competing Series section to fit new classification.\nAdded saturation statement to Drainage and Ksat section.\nAdded soybeans and edited native vegetation statement in Use and Veg.\nAdded LRRs and MLRAs to Distribution and Extent.\nAdded in salt accumulation depths to Remarks section.\nAdded Additional Data section with NSSL characterization data.\nOSD Modification 8/2012 DJK Added soil moisture and temperature to RIC. Lowered sand content for the Ap from 7 to 4 percent. Lowered the sand content for the Bt and Btz horizons from 4 to 2 percent. Increased lower clay content for Bt and PSCS from 40 to 42. Increased the sand content for the Cz from 8 to 10. Added calcium carbonate equivalent to RIC. Updated competing series. Added precipitation pattern to geographic setting. Added linear extensibility to remarks.\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL characterization data available for pedons 79NE059006 and 79NE059010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
