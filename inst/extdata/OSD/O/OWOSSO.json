  "OVERVIEW": "The Owosso series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy glaciofluvial deposits and the underlying loamy till on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
