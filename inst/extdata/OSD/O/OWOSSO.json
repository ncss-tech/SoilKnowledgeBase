  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Owosso soils are on till plains and moraines of Wisconsinan age. The slope gradient commonly is 2 to 12 percent but the range is 0 to 25 percent. The Owosso soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial deposits and the underlying loamy till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 11.7 degrees C (47 to 53 degrees F). Mean summer temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F)."

The Kendallville and Metea soils, the moderately well drained Miami soils, the poorly drained Brookston soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Conover soils are associated on moraines. Boyer and Oshtemo soils are on adjoining outwash plains."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the glaciofluvial deposits and moderately high in the till. Permeability is moderately rapid in the sandy loam A and B horizons, and moderately slow in the 2B and 2C horizons."

A smaller part is in permanent pasture or forest. Native vegetation is forest, chiefly of oaks, hickory, beech, and maple."
