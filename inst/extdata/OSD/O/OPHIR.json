Elevations range from 1,435 to 1,770 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Godecke, Jubilee, and Mottsville soils.  Godecke soils are fine-loamy, have natric horizons and horizons with durinodes, and have endosaturation at depths between 107 to 150 cm. Jubilee soils are coarse-loamy and have aquic conditions at depths within 50 cm of the soil surface. Mottsville soils are excessively drained and do not have redoximorphic features or endosaturation within the series control section."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 50 to 76 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for extremely brief periods throughout the year."

The present vegetation is mainly grass-legume hay or improved pasture supporting sedges, rushes, and grasses.  Caution is needed when vegetation on this soil is used for pasture because it may contain molybdenum in levels which are toxic to domestic animals."

Another pedon sampled as S61Nev-3-3 has properties that are not within the range of the series.  The data for two of the three pedons is published in Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 23.\nUser Pedon ID: 2006NV005062.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
