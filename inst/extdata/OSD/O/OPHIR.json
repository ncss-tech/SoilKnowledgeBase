  "OVERVIEW": "The Ophir series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks.  Ophir soils are on alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Godecke soils are fine-loamy, have natric horizons and horizons with durinodes, and have endosaturation at depths between 107 to 150 cm. Jubilee soils are coarse-loamy and have aquic conditions at depths within 50 cm of the soil surface. Mottsville soils are excessively drained and do not have redoximorphic features or endosaturation within the series control section."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 50 to 76 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) from December through May.  Cumulative annual duration classes are Common or Persistent.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding for extremely brief periods throughout the year."

The present vegetation is mainly grass-legume hay or improved pasture supporting sedges, rushes, and grasses.  Caution is needed when vegetation on this soil is used for pasture because it may contain molybdenum in levels which are toxic to domestic animals."
