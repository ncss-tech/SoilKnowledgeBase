  "OVERVIEW": "The Ocala series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of volcanic ash.  Ocala soils are on stream terraces, flood plains, lake plains, inset fans, fan skirts, and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 100 cm (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between February and June. Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  The water table ranges from 90 to 150 cm during the peak of the spring runoff period.  Originally all of these soils were poorly drained but entrenchment of local streams and isolation due to stream meandering has lowered the water table to depths below 210 cm.  Wet, drained, and flooded phases are recognized."

In some areas, where water is available, native meadows are irrigated and either cut for hay or pastured.  The vegetation is principally black greasewood, rubber rabbitbrush, inland saltgrass, and alkali sacaton in the more saline areas; basin wildrye, creeping wildrye and inland saltgrass are in the less saline areas."

Future study is needed to determine the amount of volcanic glass in this series and whether the taxonomic class should be changed to Ashy, glassy, calcareous, mesic Aquandic Halaquepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A and part of the C horizons).\nDurinodes - The zone from about 38 to 48 cm and 58 to 152 cm (Ckq1, Ckq3, Akqb, and 2Ckq horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 90 and 150 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the Akqb and 2Ckq horizons).\nAquic - an apparent seasonal high water table between 90 and 100 cm (part of Akqb Horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Ckq1, Ckq2, Ckq3 and parts of the C and Akqb horizons)."
