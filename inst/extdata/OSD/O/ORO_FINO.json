  "OVERVIEW": "The Oro Fino series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium or slope alluvium derived from gneiss and schist.  These soils are on hills, ridges, pediments, cuestas and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
