The soils are calcareous and strongly or very strongly alkaline throughout the A and Ak horizons.  The mollic epipedon has 1 to 4 percent organic matter throughout.  Depth to the gravelly substratum is 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has SAR of 2 to 10 and EC of 8 to 30.  The EC values are highest at the surface.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has a value 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 moist and 2 or 3 dry.  It is gravelly loam, gravelly sandy loam, loamy sand, and gravelly loamy sand. It has 10 to 30 percent gravel and 5 to 15 percent clay."
