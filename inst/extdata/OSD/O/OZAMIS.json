  "OVERVIEW": "The Ozamis series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in stratified lacustrine deposits and alluvium derived from volcanic ash and volcanic rocks. Ozamis soils are on lakebeds, alluvial flats and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Ambraw, Gansner, Settlemeyer, Sloan, and Toppenish series.\nAmbraw and Sloan soils have peak periods of precipitation in the summer and do not have a volcanic ash influence. Gansner soils do not have a volcanic ash influence and formed in alluvium derived dominantly from metasedimentary rocks. Settlemeyer soils do not have a volcanic ash influence and may have a calcareous A horizon. Toppenish soils have very gravelly materials within the particle-size control section and have cambic horizons."

These soils formed in stratified lacustrine deposits and alluvium derived from volcanic ash and volcanic rocks such as basalt and tuff. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,525 meters. The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 360 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 50 to 100 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Crump, Drews, Kewake, Lakeview, and Reese soils. Crump soils have histic epipedons and are on slightly lower positions. Drews soils are well drained, have argillic horizons, and are on adjacent higher terraces. Kewake soils are on sand dunes. Lakeview soils are moderately well drained and have thick mollic epipedons. Reese soils have ochric epipedons and an SAR of 13 or more."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 122 cm (shallow through deep free water occurrence classes) between March and June. Cumulative annual duration class is Common. A drained phase is recognized. Some phases are susceptible to frequent ponding for long duration from March through September with water up to 15 cm deep. Some phases of these soils are susceptible to rare flooding for very brief periods between March and September."
