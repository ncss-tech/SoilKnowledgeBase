  "OVERVIEW": "The Oland series consists of very deep, well drained soils on benches,\nmountainsides, and canyon slopes.  They formed in material weathered\nfrom granitic rocks.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes are 10 to 90\npercent.  The average annual precipitation is about 18 inches, and the\naverage annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
