  "OVERVIEW": "The Overlandtrail series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and/or slope alluvium derived from igneous and metamorphic rock over sedimentary rock. These soils are on hillslopes and eroded fan remnants. Slopes are 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
