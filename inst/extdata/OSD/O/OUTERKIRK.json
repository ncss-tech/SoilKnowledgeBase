  "OVERVIEW": "The Outerkirk series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Outerkirk soils are on alluvial fans and basin floors and have slopes of 1 to 6 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
