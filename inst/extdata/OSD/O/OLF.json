    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the paralithic contact is 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).  The mean annual soil temperature is about 17 degrees C (62.6 degrees F), and the difference between the mean summer and the mean winter temperature is about 5 degrees C (9 degrees F).  The soil between the depths of 20 and 46 centimeters (8 and l8 inches) becomes dry in all parts sometime in May or June to November and becomes moist in all parts from sometime in January to mid-March for about 60 to 75 consecutive days.  The soil temperature is not at any time below 8 degrees C (47 degrees F).  The moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline throughout.  Some pedons do not have organic matter coatings on the faces of prisms.  Sand is moving mostly along the cracks and coats the prisms in the Btk horizons.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3; 7.5YR 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 4/3, 5/3, or 4/4; 7.5YR 4/4.  It has 8 to 12 percent clay, and 5 to 10 percent gravel, mostly iron rich nodules.  Clay content between the E and the Bt horizon is more than 30 percent absolute.  ESP ranges from 5 to 10, and the electrical conductivity is less than 2.\nThe E horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3, 7/2, 7/3, or 7/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3, 5/3, or 5/4.  It is loamy sand or sandy loam.  Clay content is 5 to 10 percent and has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Btk horizons have dry color of 7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 6/4; 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, or 6/4.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/4; 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, or 4/4.  Texture is clay or clay loam.  Clay content is 35 to 50 percent and coarse fragments are 0 to 10 percent.  ESP is 5 to 10 and electrical conductivity is 2 to 4.\nChanneled and eroded phases are also recognized in this series."
