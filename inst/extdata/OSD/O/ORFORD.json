  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Orford soils are on broad ridges, hill slopes, benches, and plateaus.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metasediments, metavolcanics, sandstone, siltstone, and volcanic tuffs.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 100 to 3,500 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 53 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 55 to 90 inches, but may range to 130 inches in the interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon.  The frost-free period is 100 to 260 days."
