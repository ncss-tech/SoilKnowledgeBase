  "OVERVIEW": "The Orford series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sedimentary and volcanic rock.  They are on broad ridges, benches, hill slopes, and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 95 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
