    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly mapped as Positas in the Los Banos Area, series 1939 report.  They are being differentiated by having less than 1 percent organic matter and being noneffervescent.  pH determined by colorimetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog triplex indicators.  Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  Organic matter assumed to be less than 1 percent.  Base saturation determined by KC1-triethanolamine extract (sum of cations).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon- the zone from 0 to 16 inches (A1, A2, A3)\nArgillic horizon- the zone from 16 to 62 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2BCt1, 2BCt2)"
