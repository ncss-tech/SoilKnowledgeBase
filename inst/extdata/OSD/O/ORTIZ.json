  "OVERVIEW": "The Ortiz series consists of deep, well drained, slow permeable soils of low erosivity over noncemented shale bedrock,that formed from mixed alluvium of mostly granite, gneiss, and schist with fewer sedimentary rocks over residuum weathered from shale bedrock. Ortiz soils are on lower backslopes of eroded fan remnants. Slopes range from 15 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, frost free period is about 140 days and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
