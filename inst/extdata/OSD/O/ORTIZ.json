The Durango, Fikel, and Hosta do not contact a paralithic within 80 inches, the Erramouse, Hualapai, Jacee, Montecito, Nogal, Paguate, Teco, Tinian, and Wilmac soils are moderately deep or deep to bedrock.  Erramouse and Hualapai are granitic soils, and Montecito are basaltic. The Fikel, Hosta, Nogal, Prater, Teco, Tinian, and Wilmac soils formed in sedimentary rocks.  Montecito and Prater soils have more yellow hues.  Prater soils are found in slightly wetter climates and Tinian soils are found in slightly drier climates"

Altega soils are fine-silty, do not have rock fragments in their surface horizon, and occur on footslopes of eroded fan remnants. Fangio soils are fine, have a calcic horizon, and are located on lower backslopes of eroded fan remnants. Predawn soils are fine-loamy, have a fine horizon in the upper part of the argillic, and occur on summits of eroded fan remnants."
