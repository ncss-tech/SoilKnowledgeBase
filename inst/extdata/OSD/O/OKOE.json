These soils are on all hillslope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to hilly `a`a flows that are 3,000 to 5,000 years old.  Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1020 to 2030 millimeters (40 to 80 inches).  The mean annual temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees C (72 to 78 degrees F).  The mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
