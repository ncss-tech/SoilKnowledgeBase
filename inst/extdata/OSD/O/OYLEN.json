  "BYREV": "Rev. DLA-ROP-KDS-AGG",
  "REVDATE": "03/2003",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Oylen series consist of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in a loamy mantle and sandy and gravelly outwash on outwash plains or glacial beach deposits on glacial lake beaches. They have moderately rapid permeability in the loamy mantle and rapid in the substratum. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches. The depth to free carbonates typically ranges from 36 to 48 inches but may range from 24 to 60 inches or more. Depth to the sandy sediments is 15 to 24 inches. The loamy sediments contain up to 5 percent fine gravel (2 to 5 millimeters in size) by volume. The sandy sediments contain 0 to 25 percent gravel by volume.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 2 or 3 and chroma 1 to 3. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam or loam. The Bt horizon has few to common clay films on the faces of peds, in pores, and clay bridging between sand grains. It is slightly acid or neutral. Some pedons have a 2Bt horizon that have clay films bridging sand grains.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Few to many low and high chroma redox features above a depth of 40 inches. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 4. It has redox features similar to the 2Bw horizon. It is sand, coarse sand, very coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues. It is neutral to moderately alkaline."
