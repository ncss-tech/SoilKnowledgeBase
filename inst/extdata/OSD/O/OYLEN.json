  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches. The depth to free carbonates typically ranges from 36 to 48 inches but may range from 24 to 60 inches or more. Depth to the sandy sediments is 15 to 24 inches. The loamy sediments contain up to 5 percent fine gravel (2 to 5 millimeters in size) by volume. The sandy sediments contain 0 to 25 percent gravel by volume.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 2 or 3 and chroma 1 to 3. It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy loam or loam. The Bt horizon has few to common clay films on the faces of peds, in pores, and clay bridging between sand grains. It is slightly acid or neutral. Some pedons have a 2Bt horizon that have clay films bridging sand grains.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Few to many low and high chroma redox features above a depth of 40 inches. It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues. It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 4. It has redox features similar to the 2Bw horizon. It is sand, coarse sand, very coarse sand, or their gravelly analogues. It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

Clitherall, Lindvelt and Nerson have loamy textures in the lower third of the series control section. Corsair (T) soils have some strata of loamy textures in the lower half of the series control section. Langola soils are deep to a paralithic contact."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Oylen soils have plane, concave, or convex slopes on outwash plains and glacial beach ridges. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. They are formed in a thin loamy mantle over sandy and gravelly outwash or glacial beach deposits. Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 30 inches. Frost free days range from 110 to 145. Elevations above sea level range from 700 to 1400 feet."
