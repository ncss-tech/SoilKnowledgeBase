    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oboship soils formed on predominately north aspects under continuous stands of oak and chaparral in colluvium over residuum of quartz-diorite and diorite porphyry on complex side slopes of interfluves of hills and mountains on islands. This area contains some andesite dikes and fissures. Slopes range from 35 to 75 percent. Elevations are from sea level to 1732 feet (0 to 528 meters). The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with potential fog common all year. The mean annual precipitation from 7 to 17 inches (178 to 432 mm), the mean annual temperature is 59 to 66 degrees F. (15 to 19 degrees C.), and the frost free season is 355 to 365 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bosun, Nauti, Loadline, Flyer, Marpol and Express. Bosun soils are skeletal and typically found on the lower portion of slopes, Express, Nauti and Marpol soils are thermic under sage and grass and are coarse-loamy, fine-loamy and fine. Loadline soils are shallow and generally found on convex slope positions like crests of interfluves. Flyer soils are thermic and have an argillic. All these soils are found on hills and mountains."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series name is coined. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOboship soils are isothermic borderline isomesic. The iso classification dictates the moisture regime to not be xeric. These soils are possibly in the Aridic subgroup. Moisture control section data is needed for this classification.\nParticle Size Control section for this pedon is 24 to 74 centimeters.\nMollic horizon extends from 3 to 56 centimeters deep. Typically the mollic horizon is finer than loamy fine sand.\nMost pedons including the laboratory sample for the typical profile do not exhibit enough clay increase to qualify for an argillic horizon.\nThe O and surface A horizons are typically hydrophobic.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nPedon information for this type location only:\nPedon Type:   typical pedon for series            Lab Source ID:\nPedon Purpose:   full pedon description           Lab Pedon #:06N0796\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
