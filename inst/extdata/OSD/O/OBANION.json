  "OVERVIEW": "The Obanion series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments.  These soils are on alluvial fans and basin fill plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C. and the mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm.",
