    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Obanion soils are in depressions and seep areas on alluvial fans and basin fill plains.  Elevations are 1,370 to 1,524 meters.  They have formed in mixed alluvium or lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The climate is arid.  The mean annual temperature is 10 to 11 degrees C.; average annual precipitation of 150 to 230 mm; and the frost free season is l00 to l30 days."

The water table level is largely related to the artesian pressure.  Very slow or ponded runoff; moderately slow permeability; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity."
