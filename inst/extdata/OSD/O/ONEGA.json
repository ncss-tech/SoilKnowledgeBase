  "OVERVIEW": "The Onega series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in eolian or glaciolacustrine deposits on flats near dunes on glacial lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 4 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 670 millimeters.",
