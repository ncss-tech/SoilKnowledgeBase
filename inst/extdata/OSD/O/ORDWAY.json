  "STATES": "CO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ordway series consists of deep, well drained, slow to moderate permeable soils that formed in moderately thin calcareous gypsiferous and fine to moderately fine textured materials weathered from gypsiferous shales.  These nearly level to moderately sloping soils are on hills, ridges, and upland plains.  Slopes range 0 to 12 percent or more.",
