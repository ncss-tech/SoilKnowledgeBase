  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 90 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  Fragments, commonly rounded pebbles or gravel, range from 0 to 5 percent above the fragipan and from 0 to 15 percent in the fragipan and below.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe A and Ap horizon have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have an A horizon with value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3 and are less than 8 inches in thickness.  Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have a transitional horizon between the A and Bt horizons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Few to common redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, red, or yellow; some pedons have redox features in shades of gray in the lower 2 to 5 inches.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many and are in shades of yellow, brown and gray, or it is an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B't and 2Bt horizon, where present, have colors similar to the Btx horizon.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many and are in shades of brown, red, yellow, and gray, or it is an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is loam, silt loam, clay loam, silty clay, or silty clay loam.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Few to many redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, red, yellow, or gray, or it is an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color.  Texture is typically stratified layers ranging from sandy loam to clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Apalona, Bedford, Cincinnati, Fountainville, Hosmer, Otwell, Solsberry, and Zanesville series.  The Solsberry, Cincinnati, and Bedford soils formed in loess over materials of glacial origin.  The Hosmer soils formed in loess deeper than 60 inches.  Apalona, Fountainville, and Zanesville soils formed in loess over residuum of sandstone, siltstone, or shale on uplands.  Otwell soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess over lacustrine and glacial outwash materials and are well drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Otwood soils are on nearly level to moderately steep stream and river terraces.  Slopes commonly range from 0 to 12 percent, but the range allows up to 25 percent.  These soils formed in a mixture of loess and silty alluvium and the underlying clayey or loamy residuum of shale, siltstone, sandstone, or limestone.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 56.2 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 44.4 inches."

The well drained Nolin soils and the more imperfectly drained Lindside, Newark, Belnap, McGary, and Melvin soils are on adjacent flood plains.  The well drained Elk and Wheeling soils, the somewhat poorly drained Weinbach soils, and the poorly drained Ginat soils are on adjacent terraces."
