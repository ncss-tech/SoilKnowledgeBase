  "OVERVIEW": "The Otwood series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils with a fragipan.  The soil is on nearly level to moderately steep stream and river terraces.  The soil formed in a mixture of loess and silty alluvium and the underlying residuum of shale, siltstone, sandstone, or limestone.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.",

The Solsberry, Cincinnati, and Bedford soils formed in loess over materials of glacial origin.  The Hosmer soils formed in loess deeper than 60 inches.  Apalona, Fountainville, and Zanesville soils formed in loess over residuum of sandstone, siltstone, or shale on uplands.  Otwell soils formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess over lacustrine and glacial outwash materials and are well drained."
