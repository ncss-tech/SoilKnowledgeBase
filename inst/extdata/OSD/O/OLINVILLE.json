  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Olinville Series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that have formed in a shallow to moderately deep loamy mantle of human transported soil materials over alluvium. They are nearly level soils on anthropogenically altered floodplains subject to occasional flooding. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees Celsius, and mean annual precipitation is about 1196 millimeters.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the human transported fill materials ranges from 25 to 100 centimeters. The human transported fill may be any natural material ranging from till and outwash to alluvium, usually from a local source. Artifact content in the fill is less than 10 percent by volume. Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in the fill material, and 0 to 15 percent in the natural alluvium. Iron depletions with chroma of two or less are typically found between the depths of 75 and 100 centimeters from the mineral soil surface. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe ^A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 o 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. It has granular or subangular blocky structure and is friable, although compacted areas may have platy structure and/or a firm consistence.\nThe ^Bw, ^BC, or ^C horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. The texture is dominantly sandy loam, but fine sandy loam, loam and silt loam may also occur. Structure is subangular blocky, but may be platy in areas where heavy machinery has been used to spread fill materials. Consistence is friable to firm.\nMost pedons have a 2Ab horizon. It has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam. It has granular or subangular blocky structure or it is massive. Consistence friable or firm.\nSome pedons have 2Bb horizons with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 o 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. The texture is similar to the 2Ab. Structure is subangular blocky or it is massive. Consistence is friable or firm.\nThe buried 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture ranges from silt loam to sand. It is massive or single grain. Consistence is friable or very friable."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Olinville soils are located on nearly level floodplains that have been altered by anthopogenic activity. These soils are formed in transported soil material, with a natural subsoil that is either a buried pedon or shows evidence of being a truncated soil. The cap of transported soil material is relatively clean of human artifacts, with less than 10 percent by volume fragments of brick, concrete, glass, plastic, metal, coal slag, or other manufactured materials. The transported soil material is predominantly from locally excavated upland materials such as till or outwash deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1021 to 1325 millimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees Celsius."

Nearby upland soils include Greenbelt and Centralpark, both formed in greater than 25 centimeters of fill, and Charlton, Chatfield, and Hollis, all formed in till from gneiss, schist, and granite with less than 25 centimeters of fill on the surface."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Olinville soils are mapped in the soil survey areas of the Bronx River Watershed, Bronx County NY and the initial survey areas of Bronx County, NY. The soils are of minimal extent (less than 1,000 acres), however they are of unique importance to users of the soil surveys.\nThe recent human transported mantle of these soils may have colors that meet the required characteristic of mollic or umbric epipedons, however the concept of an epipedon requires that sufficient time be given to erase or act on such transient marks of deposition.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Umbric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 10 inches (0 to 25 centimeters).\n2. Cambic horizon - from 25 to 50 centimeters.\n3. Buried soil from the 2Ab horizon and below.\n4. Oxyaquic conditions - redoximorphic depletions 84 to 100 centimeters."
