  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic soil layers ranges from 16 to 50 inches.  The organic materials are comprised of herbaceous and woody materials.  Slightly decomposed woody fragments comprise 2 to 15 percent by volume of the organic materials.  Thin layers of live sphagnum moss up to 4 inches in thickness commonly occur on the surface.  The organic soil layers are neutral or have hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 1 through 4, and chroma of 0 through 2.  The value and/or chroma may increase 1 or 2 units when exposed to air.  Reaction is extremely acid.\nThe surface tier, exclusive of loose surface litter or moss, is comprised of hemic or fibric material with an unrubbed fiber content that ranges from 35 to 95 percent of the organic volume; rubbed fiber content ranges from 15 to 90 percent.  It has weak to moderate, medium to coarse granular structure.\nThe subsurface tier is dominated by hemic material.  The unrubbed fiber content ranges from 35 to 80 percent; the rubbed fiber content ranges from 10 to 40 percent.  It is dominantly massive, but ranges to include granular structure.\nThe organic bottom tier, where present, has the same range as the subsurface tier.\nThe C horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR through 5GY, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Merwin series in the same family and the Cathro, Chocorua, and Greenwood series in related families.  The Merwin soils have a thin buried soil in the upper part of the mineral substratum.  Cathro soils are dominantly of sapric material and are less acid.  Chocorua soils have a coarser textured mineral substratum.  Greenwood soils have organic materials thicker than 51 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ossipee soils occur in depressional areas within outwash and lake plains and on glacial till uplands.  The average size of these soil areas ranges from about 5 to 75 acres.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The climate is humid and cool temperate.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches."
