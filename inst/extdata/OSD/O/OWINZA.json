  "OVERVIEW": "The Owinza series consists of soils that are well drained and very deep that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  They are in depressions on terraces.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
