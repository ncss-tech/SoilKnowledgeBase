  "OVERVIEW": "The Ortello series consists of very deep, well drained soils on uplands and stream terraces.  They formed in loamy and sandy eolian deposits derived from glacial deposits, alluvium, and residuum.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 660 millimeters and mean annual air temperature is 9 degrees C.",
