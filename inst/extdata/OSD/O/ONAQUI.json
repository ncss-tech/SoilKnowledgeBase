  "OVERVIEW": "The Onaqui series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from quartzite.  These soils are on mountainsides and ridges with slopes of 10 to 60 percent.  The average annual  precipitation is about 20 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil moisture regime is Xeric with the soil moisture control section dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F.\nThese soils are 10 to 20 inches deep over fractured quartzite. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  The control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent throughout the profile. The surface is covered with 50 to 90 percent gravel, channers, cobbles, flagstones and stones.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam, cobbly loam, extremely cobbly loam, extremely cobbly silt loam, or very cobbly silt loam.  The A horizon has weak or moderate very fine or fine granular structure in the upper part and weak or moderate very fine or fine subangular blocky structure in the lower part.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline in the upper part and mildly to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nSome pedons have a Bw, Bk or C horizons."
