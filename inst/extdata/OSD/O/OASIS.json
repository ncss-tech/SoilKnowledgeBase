  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 65 to 72 degrees F.  The soil is usually dry in all parts above the base of the moisture control section for more than 50 percent of the time that the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The soil moisture regime is Aridic bordering on Xeric.\nThe exchangeable sodium is in excess of 15 percent and generally in excess of 30 percent and ranges as high as 80 percent.  There are gravelly pockets below a depth of 24 inches in some pedons.  Organic matter decreases irregularly as depth increases.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It ranges from moderately to very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3.5 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4, usually 3 or 4. It is loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam and has 7 to 18 percent clay, less than 50 percent silt plus clay and less than 20 percent rock fragments. Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 3 to 40 percent, but is 5 to 20 percent in most places. There is no calcic horizon within a depth of 40 inches.  Textural stratification is common below depth of 24 inches.  Reaction is moderately alkaline through very strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent, usually 1 to 3 percent. The surface is usually uneven due to soil accumulation around the brush.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone, shale and some limestone and igneous rocks. These soils occur at elevations of 4,500 to 6,000 feet in a semiarid climate. Mean annual temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 66 to 73 degrees F. The frost-free period is 105 to 140 days. Average annual precipitation ranges from 7 to 11 inches."
