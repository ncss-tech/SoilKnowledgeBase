These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches or lithic contact for 60 to 80 consecutive days.  The soils are slightly acid or neutral.  The solum ranges from 12 to 20 inches thick. Depth to basalt bedrock ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  The control section contains 50 to 80 percent coarse fragments.\nThe B horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 2 through 4 moist.  It is silt loam or loam and is gravelly or very gravelly.  This horizon has weak granular structure, or is massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value and chroma of 2 through 4 moist.  It is silt loam or loam and is very gravelly or very stony."

Ahl soils have sola from 20 to 36 inches thick and have smeary consistence throughout.  Brody soils have a mean summer temperature colder than 59 degrees F., with no 0 horizon.  Beausite soils have sola 20 to 36 inches thick and have gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam control sections. Alderwood, Dabob, Hoodsport, Sinclair, Whidbey, and Winston soils lack a lithic contact within depth of 40 inches.  Cathcart soils have sola 24 to 40 inches thick and contain less than 50 percent coarse fragments.  Everett soils have 10YR or 7.5YR hue in the control section.  Klaus soils have coarse apparent field textures."

These soils occur in a mild marine climate with cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters.  The mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is 38 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is about 28 to 32 inches.  The mean annual frost free growing season is about 160 to 190 days."
