  "OVERVIEW": "The Orangeburg series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A). They formed in loamy and clayey marine sediments. Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 52 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent.",

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Norfolk and Thursa series are the only known series in the same family. The Bama, Noboco, Pikeville, Ruston and Warnock series are in closely related families in the Southern Coastal Plain.  Norfolk soils are on similar positions but have yellower subsoils.  Thursa soils are on similar positions but have yellower upper subsoils that are more than 10 inches in thickness.  None of the other competing series have kandic horizons. Bama, Pikeville and Ruston soils are on similar positions but have more than 20 percent silt in the control section. In addition, Pikeville soils have more than 15 percent gravel in the profile and Ruston soils have a bisequal profile. The moderately well or well drained Noboco are on similar to lower positions and have yellower subsoils. The moderately well drained Warnock soils are on similar positions in the Western Coastal Plain, have yellower subsoils and have Bx horizons in the lower subsoil."

All of these series, except Grady and Vaucluse soils are on similar positions. The somewhat excessively drained Americus and Eustis soils have weakly expressed Bt horizons. In addition, Americus soils are Rhodic. Benevolence soils have coarse-loamy subsoils.  Dothan, Fuquay, and Tifton soils have horizons containing 5 percent or more plinthite in the subsoil.  In addition, Fuquay soils have surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness while Tifton soils have more than 5 percent, by volume, ironstone throughout the profile.  Faceville and Greenville soils have clayey control sections. In addition, Greenville soils are Rhodic.  The poorly drained Grady soils are in depressions on uplands or along shallow drainageways and have clayey control sections.  Lucy and Wagram soils have surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  In addition, Wagram has yellower subsoils.  Red Bay soils are Rhodic.  Vaucluse soils are on upland slope breaks, have yellower subsoils and have the upper boundary of a brittle layer within 36 inches of the soil surface."
