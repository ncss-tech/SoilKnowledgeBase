  "OVERVIEW": "The Owenfort series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium or outwash.  These soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces, inset fans and outwash fans.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6.0 degrees C.",
