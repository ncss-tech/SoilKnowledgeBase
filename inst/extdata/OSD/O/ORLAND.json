  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Colors range from light brownish gray to grayish brown or gray.  Textures are usually loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam and are generally free of gravel although some gravelly or sandy strata may be present.  The upper profile is slightly acid or neutral with the reaction increasing to neutral to moderately alkaline where calcareous.  Profiles deeper than 30 inches to gravel are commonly slightly calcareous.  The soils are usually moderately deep or deep to gravel but may be very deep or shallow."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Nearly level to very gently undulating recent flood plains and alluvial fans; channeled microrelief occurs in areas adjacent to actively eroding streams. The Orland soils occur at elevations below 1,250 feet in a dry subhumid, mesothermal climate having a mean annual precipitation of 15 to 25 inches with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters; an average January temperature of about 44 degrees F.; an average July temperature of about 80 degrees F.; a mean annual temperature of about 61 degrees F.; and a frost free season of about 260 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Orland soils occur in the same general area as the Arbuckle, Cortina, and Wyo soils.  They resemble the Columbia, Cortina, Elder, Molinos, Sorrento, Sycamore, Wyo, and Yolo soils.  The Columbia soils developed in alluvium of mixed origin and are imperfectly drained, being mottled in the upper C horizons.  The Cortina soils are gravelly throughout.  The Elder soils developed in alluvium from siliceous shales, are dark grayish brown or dark gray, and usually are shaly and moderately fine textured.  The Molinos soils developed in alluvium from basic igneous rocks, are moderately coarse textured, and usually dark grayish brown. The Sorrento soils are very similar to the Orland but developed in alluvium from relatively unmetamorphosed rock and contain little sericite.  The Sycamore soils are mottled in the upper C horizons but otherwise resemble the Orland. The Wyo soils occur on slightly higher stream terraces or older flood plains; they have weakly developed textural B horizons.  The Yolo soils have browner C horizons and are noncalcareous."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Well drained; runoff is slow; permeability is moderate.  Areas not protected by levees are subject to overflow during periods of high rainfall.  Water tables are normally below 6 to 8 feet, but may rise to 3 to 5 feet during periods of high stream flow if not flooded. Subsoil drainage is excessive for shallower phases."

Shallow depth phases or areas subject to flooding are used for grazing.  Annual grasses and forbs with open to dense stands of valley oak, black walnut, and cottonwood trees."
