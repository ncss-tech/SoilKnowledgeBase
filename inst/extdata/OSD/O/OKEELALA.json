  "OVERVIEW": "The Okeelala series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils in dissected uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area (133A). They formed in Upper Cretaceous to the Oligocene-age cross-bedded sandy and loamy sediments.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 60 degrees F., and the average annual rainfall is about 53 inches. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.",

Mottles in shades of red and brown range from none to many.  Chert, quartz or ironstone pebbles range from none to few. Texture is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue from 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.

Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe upper part of the C horizon ranges in hue from 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; in some places the colors are intermingled or there is a matrix with few to many mottles in shades of brown to red.  Texture is loamy fine sand, sand fine sandy loam or sandy loam; or it is irregularly stratified in a combination of these textures.\nThe lower part of the C horizon has the same range of colors and textures as the upper part. It has varying amounts of glauconite and mica.  Discontinuous thin laminae of loamy and clayey material are in the sandy matrix of some pedons. Chert, quartz, or ironstone gravel, if present, is less than 10 percent of the volume."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Okeelala soils are on maturely dissected uplands, featured by narrow winding ridges and deeply incised valleys of the Southern Coastal Plain.  They formed in thick beds of dominantly loamy and sandy marine deposits of the upper Cretaceous to the Oligocene.  These soils mainly overlie the Coffee Sand Formation, which typically consists of cross-bedded, glauconitic, micaceous, and calcareous sandy and loamy deposits with subordinate thin beds of calcareous sandstone concretions and laminated layers of clay.  The climate is warm and humid. Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 58 to 62 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 55 inches."

Brantley soils are on similar to lower positions and have clayey control sections. Luverne and Sweatman soils are on similar positions, have clayey control sections and are Ultisols.  The moderately well drained Ora and Savannah soils are on higher ridge top positions and have fragipans.  Ruston and Smithdale soils are Ultisols.  In addition, Ruston soils have a bisequum and are on broad smooth ridge tops while Smithdale soils are on similar positions as Okeelala. Saffell soils are on similar positions, are Ultisols and have a loamy-skeletal family. The well drained to somewhat excessively drained Wadley soils are on the lower positions of hill slopes, are Ultisols and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches thick."

Prior to that, these soils were included with the Cahaba series.  The unweathered parent material has thin discontinuous calcareous strata and contains appreciable glauconite and muscovite mica.\nSoil Interpretation Record Number MS0126.\nOkeelala soils are in MLRA 133A."
