  "OVERVIEW": "The Ota series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and volcanic ash mixed with colluvium over residuum from cinders and pumice. Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent on lava plains. The average annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the average annual temperature is about 11.5 degrees C.",
