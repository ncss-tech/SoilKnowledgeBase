  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Oshoto series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary sources.  Oshoto soils are on fan remnants, alluvial fans, plateaus, terraces, ridges and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

Depth to continuous accumulations of calcium carbonate ranges from 10 to 27 inches, although some pedons may be slightly effervescent to within 5 inches of the surface where intermittent recharge has occurred.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent.  The moisture control section is usually moist in some or all parts in March through June.  The average annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is commonly clay loam or silty clay loam and less commonly loam or silt loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam or silt loam.  It has 3 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.

It is assumed the Amal, Chita, Elpedro and Muncha soils are competing pending an update of the classification.  Amal, Elpedro, Moncha and Wetherill soils have a Bt horizon with hues 7.5YR or redder.  Buick soils have buried subhorizons.  Chita soils have a calcic horizon.  Keiser soils have carbonates shalloer than 10 inches.  Klinedraw, Pulpit, Roubideau, Sharps and Verde soils have a paralithic or lithic contact within depths of 40 inches.  Wiley soils have mean annual soil temperatures of 53 degrees F. or warmer."

They formed in alluvium derived primarily from silty shale and very fine grained sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,200 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches, half of which falls as rain or snow from March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
