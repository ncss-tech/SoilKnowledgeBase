    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Average annual soil temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mollic epipedon is 20 to more than 40 inches thick. The particle-size control section is dominantly silt loam, but in many pedons there are thin lenses (less than 1 inch) of very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or medium sand; however, the weighted average texture is silt loam, which has 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. The soils are neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry  and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and 1 through 5 dry.\nThe B horizon, when present, has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 5 dry.\nThe C horizon below 40 inches ranges widely in color. Textures range from silt loam to very gravelly sandy loam."

In most places, they are subject to flooding once or twice in 10 years. The alluvium is more than 40 inches deep over contrasting material. The elevation ranges from 400 to 3,400 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 16 inches with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The average January temperature is 32 degrees F., and average July temperature is 71 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 170 days."

Ahtanum soils are in basins and have a weakly cemented pan at depths of less than 40 inches. Condon, Mikkalo, Oliphant, and Walla Walla soils are on uplands and have a regular decrease in organic carbon in the particle-size control section. Also Condon and Mikkalo soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact. Umapine soils are in basins and are strongly saline and alkaline."
