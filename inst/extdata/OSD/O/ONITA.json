  "OVERVIEW": "The Onita series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils formed in local alluvium mainly on footslopes.  These soils have moderately slow and slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",

It ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silty clay averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.  It typically is slightly acid or neutral but is slightly or moderately alkaline in the Btk horizon.  Some pedons do not have accumulations of carbonates in the lower Bt horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.

Crete and Detroit soils have a more moist climate and a mean annual temperature of more than 50 degrees F.  Ladysmith soils have 15 percent or more increase in clay content within a vertical distance of 3 inches from the surface layer to the argillic horizon.  Lane soils have carbonates higher in the profile.  Rago soils have buried paleosols in the lower part of the series control section.  Spoiniker soils have a drier soil moisture control section in May and June.  Smolan soils have redder hue."

They are at elevations of 1,000 to 2,300 feet.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 10 percent but typically are less than 2 percent.  They formed in local clayey and loamy alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 26 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F."
