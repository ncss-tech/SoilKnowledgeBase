  "OVERVIEW": "The Oleman series consists of shallow over a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from ignimbrite, rhyolite and limestone.  The Oleman soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
