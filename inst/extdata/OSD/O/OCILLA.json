    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 6O to more than 80 inches.  The A and E horizons of some pedons have pebbles of ironstone up to 5 percent.  The subsoil of some pedons contain up to 3 percent plinthite.  All horizons are strongly acid, or very strongly acid, except those surface soils that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3 through 5.  Where the value is 3, the horizon is less than 7 inches thick.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy fine sand or loamy sand.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 2 through 8.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam.  The Bt2 and Bt3 horizons are multicolored in shades of gray, yellow, brown and red; or the matrix has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8; or the matrix is neutral with value of 7, and with redoximorphic features in shades of gray, red, or brown.  They are dominantly sandy clay loam, but include coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam and sandy clay.  Pockets of sandy loam or fine sandy loam occur in some subhorizons.  Some pedons contain Btg horizons in the lower part. The weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Plinthite ranges from none to about 3 percent.\nThe Btg, BC and BCg horizons, where present, have color and textures comparable to the Bt2 and Bt3 horizons.\nThe C horizon, where present, has the same colors as the lower Bt horizon.  It is sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay or clay."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competitors in the same family.  Albany, Ardilla, Coosaw, Garcon, Leefield, and Lynchburg soils are in similar families, somewhat poorly drained, nearly level, and low lying.  Albany soils have a grossarenic epipedon.  Ardilla soils have fragic properties in the lower B horizons.  Coosaw soils have mixed mineralogy and a decreasing clay content in the lower part of the argillic horizon above 60 inches.  Garcon soils have a solum less than 60 inches thick.  Leefield soils have horizons which contain 5 to 20 percent plinthite ranging from 30 to 60 inches deep.  Lynchburg soils lack an arenic epipedon."
