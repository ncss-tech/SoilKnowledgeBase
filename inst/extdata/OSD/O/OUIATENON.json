  "OVERVIEW": "The Ouiatenon series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in calcareous, sandy and gravelly alluvium on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
