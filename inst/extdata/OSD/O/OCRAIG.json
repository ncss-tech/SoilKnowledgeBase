The soils formed in material weathered from extrusive igneous rock, mainly andesite and some rhyolite.  Elevations are 500 to 2,100 feet.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 19 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F., mean July temperature is 77 degrees F., and mean annual temperature varies from 58 degrees to 62 degrees F.  Frost-free season varies from 250 to 270 days."
