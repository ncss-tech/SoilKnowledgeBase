  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness is more than 60 inches. The boundary between the ochric epipedon and the argillic horizon is abrupt or clear and the depth to the abrupt texture change ranges from 6 to 14 inches. The content of exchangeable sodium increases with depth and ranges from 5 to 15 percent in the lower part of the solum.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is typically strongly acid or moderately acid but ranges to slightly alkaline due to the addition of alkaline irrigation water. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray or brown. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown or gray. Reaction is typically very strongly acid to moderately acid but ranges to slightly alkaline due to the addition of alkaline irrigation water. Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron and manganese accumulations and depletions are in shades of brown, red or gray. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid. Texture is silty clay or clay.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Iron and manganese accumulations and depletions are in shades of gray, yellow and brown. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These include the Anacoco, Edna, Herty, Lufkin, Mabank, Oakhurst, and Zulch series in the same family. Anacoco soils have 40 to 60 inch sola and are somewhat poorly drained. Edna soils have higher ph in the argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained. Herty soils have 40 to 60 inch sola, contain gypsum, barite and other salts in the lower part of the Bt horizon and are somewhat poorly drained. Lufkin soils have base saturation of 80 to 100 percent throughout the argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained. Mabank soils contain cemented carbonate concretions, gypsum crystals, have values of 4 or less in the upper part of the argillic and are somewhat poorly drained. Oakhurst soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick and are somewhat poorly drained. Zulch soils have 30 to 40 inch sola, have values of 3 or less in the upper argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Overcup soils are on level to nearly level slightly convex slopes on braided stream terraces in the Western Lowlands of eastern Arkansas; MLRA 131. Slopes are typically 0 to 1 percent, but range to 3 percent. Overcup soils formed in alluvial sediments deposited by the Mississippi River or its ancestors. Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 61 degrees, and the mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches."

The Bonn and Foley soils occur on slightly lower landscapes, have fine-silty control sections and natric horizons. Grubbs soils occur on short escarpments to old abandon channels, have mixed mineralogy and are\nsomewhat poorly drained. Jackport soils are on slightly higher landscapes, have very-fine control sections and do not have an abrupt texture change."
