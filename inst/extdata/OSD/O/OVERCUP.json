Herty soils have 40 to 60 inch sola, contain gypsum, barite and other salts in the lower part of the Bt horizon and are somewhat poorly drained. Lufkin soils have base saturation of 80 to 100 percent throughout the argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained. Mabank soils contain cemented carbonate concretions, gypsum crystals, have values of 4 or less in the upper part of the argillic and are somewhat poorly drained. Oakhurst soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick and are somewhat poorly drained. Zulch soils have 30 to 40 inch sola, have values of 3 or less in the upper argillic horizon and are somewhat poorly drained."
