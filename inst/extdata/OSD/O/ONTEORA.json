  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 102 to 165 cm (40 to 65 in) or more. Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 cm (60 in). Depth to the fragipan ranges from 25 to 64 cm (10 to 25 in). Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 40 percent by volume in the A and upper part of the B horizon and from 15 to 50 percent in the fragipan and C horizon. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in the Ap horizon and in the A and E horizons, if present and from very strongly acid to moderately acid below.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Dry color value is 6 or more. It is silt loam to fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It has distinct or prominent gray, brown, or reddish redoximorphic features. It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Redoximorphic features of gray, brown, or yellowish red are in some pedons. It is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Prism interiors have platy or blocky structure or they are massive. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nSome pedons may have a BC horizon up to 33 cm (13 in) thick below the Bx.\nThe C horizon has colors and textures similar to those of the Bx horizon but lacks very coarse prismatic structure and is not brittle."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Onteora soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils on concave landforms and depressions on summits and the lower parts of hillsides in the uplands. Due to frigid soil temperatures, these soils occur on landscapes and landforms at higher elevations in the MLRA. Slope commonly is from 0 to 15 percent but the range includes up to 25 percent. The soils developed in firm, acid till derived from reddish sandstone, siltstone and shale. The climate is humid and is cool in summer and cold in winter. Annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm (32 to 70 in) and the frost free days range from 110 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 1100 m (1394 to 3608 ft) above sea level."

Moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained Gretor, well drained Mongaup, and somewhat excessively drained Vly soils are on nearby bedrock-controlled areas. Shallow, somewhat poorly drained Tor soils, and shallow Halcott and Hawksnest soils are also on nearby bedrock- controlled areas."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Onteora soils were proposed as the frigid equivalent of the Morris series, but lack a horizon dominated by colors with a chroma of 2 or less. Areas of frigid Aeric Fragiaquepts are considered as unnamed inclusions. Future MLRA maintenance work needs to be conducted to confirm the classification of the Onteora series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 15 cm (6 in) (Ap horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon- the zone from 15 to 33 cm (6 to 13 in) (Bw horizon).\n3. Fragipan - the zone from 33 to 84 cm (13 to 33 in) (Bx horizon).\n4. Aquic subgroup - the occurrence of distinct redoximorphic features within a depth of 30 cm (12 in) below the surface.\n5. Udic soil moisture regime (a humid temperate climate).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
