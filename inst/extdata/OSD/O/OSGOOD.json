  "OVERVIEW": "The Osgood series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian sand.  Osgood soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 centimeters (12 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.) at the type location.",
