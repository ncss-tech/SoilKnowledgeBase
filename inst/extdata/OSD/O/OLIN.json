  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Olin series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in 60 to 91 centimeters (24 to 36 inches) of loamy sediments and in the underlying glacial till. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains. Slopes range from 2 to 14 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters (33 inches).",
