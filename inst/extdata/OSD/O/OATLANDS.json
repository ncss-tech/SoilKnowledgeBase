  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Oatlands Series are moderately deep, well drained with moderate permeability.  They formed in residuum that weathered from Triassic-Jurassic interbedded sandstone and conglomerate of the Culpeper Basin and Triassic lowlands in the Northern part of the Piedmont.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  At the type location, mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

Rock fragments of partially weathered Triassic and Jurassic sandstone and conglomerate ranges from about 2 to 35 percent in the solum and to 80 percent in the C horizon.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma or 3 or 4. The A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma 0 through 2.  The A horizon is loam, sandy loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Eroded Ap horizons include clay loam and silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  The E horizon is loam, sandy loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  Mottles of higher value and chroma are common in some pedons.  It is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR and is commonly multicolored in shades of red, brown, green, yellow and black.  The C horizon is sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nCr horizons are present in some areas with very irregular lower boundaries and with tonguing of C materials.  The Cr horizon, where present, is partially weathered Triassic-Jurassic sandstone and conglomerate."

The Athol, Beech, Bolton, Brecknock, Carpenter, Dumfries, Ebbing, Lamotte, Legore, Manassas, Mechanicsburg, Morrison, Myersville, Neshaminy, Panorama, Renox, and Westmoreland soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 to 60 inches or more.  Bookwood and Culleoka soils are underlain with interbedded siltstone, shale, limestone and some fine-grained sandstone and have fragments of these rocks.  Cateache soils contain mostly channers of siltstone and shale and some fine-grained sandstone. The Caribel, Greencreek, and Weedmark soils have mean annual precipitation of less than 30 inches.  The Door soils have a mollic surface layer.  The Dormont, Duffield, Hayter and Sudley soils have bedrock below 48 inches.  The Frondorf, Grayford, Lamotte and Williamsburg soils have a discontinuity and formed partly in a mantle of loess.  The Loudonville and Washington soils have subangular to rounded rock fragments from glacial till and from glacial till or colluvium, respectively.  The Penn soils have red shale rock fragments and underlain with red silty shale bedrock.  Ryder soils formed in thin bedded shaly limestone and contain rock fragments of white quartzite and limestone.  The Wheeling soils have water rounded coarse fragments and underlain with sand or sand and gravel."
