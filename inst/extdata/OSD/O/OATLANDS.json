    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 15 to 30 inches.  Depth to soft bedrock (if present) and hard bedrock is from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments of partially weathered Triassic and Jurassic sandstone and conglomerate ranges from about 2 to 35 percent in the solum and to 80 percent in the C horizon.  Soil reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma or 3 or 4. The A horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma 0 through 2.  The A horizon is loam, sandy loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Eroded Ap horizons include clay loam and silty clay loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 6.  The E horizon is loam, sandy loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, with value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 3 through 6.  Mottles of higher value and chroma are common in some pedons.  It is loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR and is commonly multicolored in shades of red, brown, green, yellow and black.  The C horizon is sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nCr horizons are present in some areas with very irregular lower boundaries and with tonguing of C materials.  The Cr horizon, where present, is partially weathered Triassic-Jurassic sandstone and conglomerate."

The Athol, Beech, Bolton, Brecknock, Carpenter, Dumfries, Ebbing, Lamotte, Legore, Manassas, Mechanicsburg, Morrison, Myersville, Neshaminy, Panorama, Renox, and Westmoreland soils have bedrock within a depth of 40 to 60 inches or more.  Bookwood and Culleoka soils are underlain with interbedded siltstone, shale, limestone and some fine-grained sandstone and have fragments of these rocks.  Cateache soils contain mostly channers of siltstone and shale and some fine-grained sandstone. The Caribel, Greencreek, and Weedmark soils have mean annual precipitation of less than 30 inches.  The Door soils have a mollic surface layer.  The Dormont, Duffield, Hayter and Sudley soils have bedrock below 48 inches.  The Frondorf, Grayford, Lamotte and Williamsburg soils have a discontinuity and formed partly in a mantle of loess.  The Loudonville and Washington soils have subangular to rounded rock fragments from glacial till and from glacial till or colluvium, respectively.  The Penn soils have red shale rock fragments and underlain with red silty shale bedrock.  Ryder soils formed in thin bedded shaly limestone and contain rock fragments of white quartzite and limestone.  The Wheeling soils have water rounded coarse fragments and underlain with sand or sand and gravel."
