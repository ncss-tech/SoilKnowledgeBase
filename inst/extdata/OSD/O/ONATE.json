  "OVERVIEW": "The Onate series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from igneous rocks and mixed sources.  Onate soils are on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts with slopes of 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

The project was a study of soils and geomorphology in an arid and semi-arid environment.  The series is extensively referenced in many documents, publications and thesis.  Revision outside the project area is discouraged in order to preserve the historical concept for research.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data for a similar pedon (S59NM-7-1) have been presented (L.H. Gile and R.B. Grossman. 1979. The Desert Project Soil Monograph. Document PB80-135304. National Technical Information Service, Springfield, VA.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
