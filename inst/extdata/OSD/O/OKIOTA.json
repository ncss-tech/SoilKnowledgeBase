The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from February 1 to December 31 and exceeds 47 degrees F from March 1 to November 30.  The soil between depths of 7 inches and bedrock or 14 inches is moist in all parts from December through April 15, and is dry in all parts from July through October.  Organic carbon is 1 to 3 percent.  Calcium to magnesium ratio is 1:1 or less.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR or 5YR 4/4, 3/4, or 3/2.  Moist color is 7.5YR or 5YR 3/3, 3/2 or 2/2.  Texture is clay loam, gravelly loam,  gravelly clay loam or very gravelly clay loam.  Cobble content is 0 to 15 percent and gravel content is from 5 to 50 percent.  Rock fragments are commonly concentrated at or near the surface.  Reaction is slightly acid or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 5/4, 4/4, 3/4 or 3/3.  Moist color is 5YR 3/2, 3/3, 3/4 or 4/4.  Texture is a clay texture with 40 to 60 percent clay.  Cobble content is from 0 to 5 percent and gravel content is from 0 to 15 percent.

The soils are formed in material weathered from serpentinitic rocks.  The climate is subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 24 to 50 inches.  Mean January temperature is 43 degrees F; mean July temperature is 72 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 53 to 60 degrees F.
