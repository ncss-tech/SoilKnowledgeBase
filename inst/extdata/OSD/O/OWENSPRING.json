  "OVERVIEW": "The Owenspring series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium and slide deposits over residuum derived from interbedded sedimentary rock. These soils occur on hills, mountains, escarpments, structural benches, and landslides. Slopes range from 4 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 430 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
