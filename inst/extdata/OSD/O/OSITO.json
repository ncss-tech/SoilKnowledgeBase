  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Osito soils are on uplands and have slopes of 15 to 70 percent. Elevation is 200 to 1200 meters (650 to 4000 feet). They are formed in material weathered from interbedded fine grained sandstone and shale. The climate is dry, subhumid, mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 330 to 500 mm (13 to 20 inches). Average January temperature is 9 degrees C (48 degrees F); average July temperature is 22 degrees C (72 degrees F); mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F). Frost-free season is approximately 200 to 320 days."
