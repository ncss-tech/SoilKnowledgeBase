  "OVERVIEW": "The Osito series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in material weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale. Osito soils are on uplands and have slopes of 15 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 432 centimeters (17 inches) and mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F).",

They are formed in material weathered from interbedded fine grained sandstone and shale. The climate is dry, subhumid, mesothermal with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 330 to 500 mm (13 to 20 inches). Average January temperature is 9 degrees C (48 degrees F); average July temperature is 22 degrees C (72 degrees F); mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C (58 degrees F). Frost-free season is approximately 200 to 320 days."

Callegues soils are calcareous throught the profile.  Millsholm soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches. Modesto and Stonyford soils have an argillic horizon. San Andreas soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size class and a mollic epipedon.  Trigo soils lack a cambic horizon."
