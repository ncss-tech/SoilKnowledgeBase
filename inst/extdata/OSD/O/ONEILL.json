  "STATES": "NE,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Oneill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy material 20 to 40 inches deep over gravelly sand.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material.  These soils are on uplands and terraces with slopes ranging from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum typically is about 26 inches and ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches and includes the A horizon and in some pedons the upper part of the B horizon.  The soil ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  In a few pedons, clay has accumulated in the lower part of the Bw2 horizon so that the layer is noticeably finer in texture than the layer above and below.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 through 8 and 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is gravelly sand, coarse sand, or sand."

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 48 degrees to 52 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brocksburg, Dunday, Jansen, Meadin, Simeon, and Valentine.  Brocksburg and Jansen soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal and Brocksburg soils have mollic colors deeper than 20 inches.  These soils occur in a lower position on the landscape.  Dunday soils lack 2C horizon of sand and gravel and are on nearly level to undulating areas above areas of Oneill.  Meadin soils are sandy-skeletal and are on steeper slopes below the Oneill soils.  Simeon and Valentine soils lack mollic epipedons and occur on higher landscape positions."
