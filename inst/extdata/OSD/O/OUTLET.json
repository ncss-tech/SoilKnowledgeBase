    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 35 degrees to 42 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches range from 50 degrees to 59 degrees F. The soils are saturated throughout for short periods of 10 to 30 days in spring and early summer, bit they ar saturated at some level between depths of 20 and 40 inches for 3 to 5 months during spring and summer. The 10 to 40 inch control section is dominantly moderately fine textured and contains 27 to 35 percent clay, more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand and less than 15 percent rock fragments. The mollic epipedon (and solum) is 10 to 16 inches thick. The A1 (or Ap) horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2.5 through 4 dry and 1 to 2.5 moist, and chroma of 0.5 to 1.5. It has strong or moderate granular structure.  To a depth of 8 inches or deeper, it is noncalcareous and neutral or mildly alkaline. The Cca horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It has weak subangular blocky structure or the soil is massive. Mottles due to segregations of iron and manganese are in one or more subhorizon between depths of 20 and 40 inches. A subhorizon of the Cca horizon from 10 to 40 inches thick contains 15 to 35 percent calcium carbonate."

Cedron, Conda, Enochville, Furniss, Tonks, and Zufelt soils are saturated throughout for a period or are drained. Cedron soils have a strongly calcareous A1 horizon and 40 to 80 percent carbonates in the Cca horizon. Conda soils have a strongly calcareous A1 horizon more than 20 inches thick and cemented layers of tufa above a depth of 40 inches. Enochville and Furniss soils are mainly noncalcareous, and Enochville soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches.  Gallatin soils have a calcareous A1 horizon thicker than 16 inches.  Slocum soils have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y and are noncalcareous. Tonks soils have less than 15 percent calcium carbonate in the Cca horizon.  Zufelt soils have mottles in and immediately below the mollic epipedon and have loose sand and gravel above a depth of 40 inches."

The soils formed in moderately fine and medium textured alluvium or lacustrine sediments. The material is dominantly from sedimentary rock sources but contains minor rhyolitic, basaltic, and granitic materials.  The subhumid climate has mean annual precipitation of 16 to 19 inches.  Most areas receive additional moisture as runoff from nearby areas.  Mean annual snowfall ranges from 7 to 12 feet. Summer showers are common. The mean freeze-free period ranges from 50 to 80 days."
