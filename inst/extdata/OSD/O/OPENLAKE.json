  "OVERVIEW": "The Openlake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in thick deposits of clayey alluvium on flood plains of the lower Mississippi River. These level to undulating soils are in slackwater areas of moderate local relief. Slopes are dominantly 0 to 2 percent, but range to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 51 inches and mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F. near the type location.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 37 to 80 inches. Cracks l to 2 cm wide develop to a depth of 50 to 75 cm in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of l to 3. Texture is silty clay, clay, or silty clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 with few to many mottles in shades of brown and red. Some pedons have a chroma of 3 above a depth of 20 inches. Some pedons have subhorizons with chroma of 1 or have faces of peds with chroma of 1 below depths of 20 inches. Texture is silty clay or clay. Some pedons have thin subhorizons of silty clay loam or silt loam. Structure is moderate or weak angular blocky or subangular blocky. Reaction is strongly acid to mildly alkaline, but at least one subhorizon within a depth of 40 inches is less acid than strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a buried A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2 or it is neutral with value of 4 to 6. Mottles are none to many in shades of brown or red. Texture is typically clay or silty clay, but some pedons have coarser textures below 40 inches. Mica flakes are commonly visible in the coarser textured strata. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline."

Series in closely related families are the Alligator, Earle, Harahan, Houlka, Keyespoint, Osage, Perry, Sharkey, Tuscumbia, Tunica and Una. Gladewater and Kobel soils are poorly drained with chroma of less than 2. Leeper soils typically have a thinner solum, do not range to strongly acid and have higher value in the A horizon. In addition, Leeper soils formed in alluvium washed from soils in the Blackland Prairies and have shorter duration of flooding. Alligator, Harahan, Perry, and Sharkey soils are poorly drained and have a very fine particle-size control section. In addition, Alligator soils are in an acid family. Earle, Keyespoint, and Tunica soils have a clayey over loamy particle-size control section and the Earle series is in an acid family. Houlka soils are in an acid family. Osage soils have a mollic epipedon 24 to 40 inches thick. Tuscumbia and Una soils are poorly drained and have mixed mineralogy."
