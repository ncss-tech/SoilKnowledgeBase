  "OVERVIEW": "The Owanka series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in clayey sediments on stream terraces and alluvial fans.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 9 to 20 inches.  Coarse and medium gravels are scattered throughout the pedon and make up less than 10 percent by volume.  Thin lens of coarse and medium gravel occur between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons and are less than 4 inches thick.  The control section contains 35 to 45 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are clay loam or silty clay loam.  They have few to common, fine to medium accumulations of carbonate. Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum and other salts.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

The Arvada, Haverson, Kyle, and Lohmiller soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  In addition, the Arvada soils have a natric horizon; Haverson and Lohmiller soils are stratified within a depth of 40 inches; and Kyle soils have a very fine series control section.  Bridgeport soils are fine-silty.  Colombo soils are fine-loamy.  Egas soils have a SAR of more than 8 throughout the profile, and are poorly or very poorly drained."
