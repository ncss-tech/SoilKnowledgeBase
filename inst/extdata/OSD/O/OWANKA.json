    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 9 to 20 inches.  Coarse and medium gravels are scattered throughout the pedon and make up less than 10 percent by volume.  Thin lens of coarse and medium gravel occur between depths of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons and are less than 4 inches thick.  The control section contains 35 to 45 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  They are clay loam or silty clay loam.  They have few to common, fine to medium accumulations of carbonate. Some pedons have accumulations of gypsum and other salts.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline."

Owanka soils formed in clayey sediments.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 43 to 48 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches.  Growing season is about 110 to 140 days, average growing season precipitation ranges from 11 to 16 inches; and growing degree days are about 2400 to 3200."

The Arvada, Haverson, Kyle, and Lohmiller soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  In addition, the Arvada soils have a natric horizon; Haverson and Lohmiller soils are stratified within a depth of 40 inches; and Kyle soils have a very fine series control section.  Bridgeport soils are fine-silty.  Colombo soils are fine-loamy.  Egas soils have a SAR of more than 8 throughout the profile, and are poorly or very poorly drained."
