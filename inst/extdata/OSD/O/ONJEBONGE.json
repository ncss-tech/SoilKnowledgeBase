  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 14 to 30 inches. The soil ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the O and A horizons, and from strongly acid to neutral in the subsoil, and strongly acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum. The content of gravel ranges from 0 to 3 percent by volume throughout the mineral soil.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It includes decomposed plant material at any stage of decomposition.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam, or their mucky analogues. It is 0 to 6 inches thick.\nThe Bg horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 10Y, value of 3 to 7, chroma of 0 to 2, and has redoximorphic features. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BCg horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR to 10GY, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 0 to 2, and has redoximorphic features.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy very fine sand.\nThe C or Cg horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 10GY, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 3. It may have varves of silt, silt loam, or very fine sand in any combination, with a composite texture of silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. Layers of sandy and/or gravelly material 1 to 3 inches thick are in some pedons. Some pedons have textures of silty clay loam and/or silty clay below a depth of 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Onjebonge soils are in slight depressions where the water table is at or near the surface for most of the year. These soils developed in water deposited silts and very fine sands in depressions on pro-glacial lake plains, glacial outwash plains, deltas, and terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees F. and annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 50 inches. The frost-free season ranges from 80 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 100 to 1750 feet above mean sea level"

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Onjebonge soil is the very poorly drained member of a drainage sequence that includes the well drained Salmon soils, the moderately well drained Nicholville soils, and the somewhat poorly and poorly drained Roundabout soils. They are also closely associated with the Hailesboro, Wegatchie, Adjidaumo, and Wonsqueak soils on nearby landscapes. Hailesboro and Wegatchie soils have more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and Adjidaumo soils have more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Wonsqueak soils formed in organic material that is at least 16 inches thick."

The potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low or moderately high in the organic  and mineral material."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Onjebonge series is on similar landforms and parent material as the Birdsall series, but in frigid areas. This series is named after Onjebonge Pond, which is a water body in the Town of Diana, Lewis County, NY, near the Indian River and Fort Drum (Natural Bridge quadrangle).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Histic epipedon - the zone from the soil surface to a depth of 13 inches (Oa1 and Oa2 horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 25 inches (Bg and BCg horizons).\n3. Coarse-silty particle size family - the zone from 10 to 40 inches contains less than 15 percent sand that is coarser than very fine sand, including gravel, and about 5 to 10 percent clay (Bg, BCg, and Cg horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
