  "OVERVIEW": "The Osobb series consists of very shallow and shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Osobb soils are on hills and plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
