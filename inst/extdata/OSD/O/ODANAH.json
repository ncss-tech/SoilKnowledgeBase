Oats, bromegrass, timothy, alfalfa, trefoil, and red clover are the principle crops.  Many areas which were formally cropland are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red maple, balsam fir, white spruce, red pine, white pine, quaking aspen, paper birch, and red oak.  Common understory species are American hazel, black snakeroot, big leaf aster, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern."
