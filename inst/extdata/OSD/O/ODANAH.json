Hue of 2.5YR is typical in the particle-size control section and is always present in at least some part.  The weighted average clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 60 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser is less than 15 percent.  Mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 2 percent throughout. Mudflow lenses or remnant discontinuous disoriented varves occur in individual horizons in some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 to 3.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction naturally ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid but ranges to neutral, where the soil is limed.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nOdanah soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizon, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR; value and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 3 to 5.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.

The somewhat poorly drained Badriver soils and the moderately well drained Sanborg soils form a drainage sequence with Odanah soils.  Manistee soils are in landscape positions similar to those of Odanah soils where there is a sandy outwash mantle 20 to 40 inches thick over the clayey till."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Some areas are used for cropland and pastureland.  Oats, bromegrass, timothy, alfalfa, trefoil, and red clover are the principle crops.  Many areas which were formally cropland are now idle and are reverting to natural vegetation. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest.  Common trees are red maple, balsam fir, white spruce, red pine, white pine, quaking aspen, paper birch, and red oak.  Common understory species are American hazel, black snakeroot, big leaf aster, wild sarsaparilla, and bracken fern."

Refer to soil survey sample number S64WI-2-1 for NSSL data on a pedon sampled as Hibbing Taxadjunct which now correlates to Odanah.  This sample site is within 100 feet of the typical pedon site.  For NSSL data on some Odanah pedons, refer to soil survey sample numbers S88WI-003-006, S90WI-007-004, S90WI-007-005, and S90WI-007-008.  Also refer to Soil Survey Investigations Report No. 34, pages 64-65, for NSSL data on another pedon which correlates to Odanah and was sampled as Hibbing Taxadjunct.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
