  "OVERVIEW": "The Okaw series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on lacustrine terraces and lake plains; mainly along major tributaries of the Mississippi River.  They formed in the dominantly clayey lacustrine sediments and have a thin mantle of loess or other silty material.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of soil development is 40 to 75 inches.  Depth to the clayey lacustrine sediments is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand.  Sand content of the A and E horizons is less than 10 percent and includes iron-manganese nodules and concretions.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap and Eg) has properties as follows:  The Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 (5 to 7 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2.  Some pedons have value of 3 (6 or more dry).  Pedons in uncultivated areas have an A horizon 3 to 5 inches thick with ranges in color and texture similar to those for the Ap horizon.  Texture is silt loam.  Clay content is 15 to 27 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid except pedons that have been limed range to neutral.\nThe Eg horizon has value of 4 to 7 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam or, less commonly, silty clay loam.  Clay content is 12 to 30 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, except pedons that have been limed range to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a B/E horizon less than 3 inches in thickness that is mostly Bt material with clay depletions on faces of peds.\nThe second part of the series control section (2Btg and 2Bg) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 0 to 2.  Redoximorphic concentrations commonly have colors with hue redder than 10YR.  The 2Btg and 2Bg horizons typically are silty clay or clay.  Some pedons have thin subhorizons that are silty clay loam.  Some pedons have slickensides or pressure faces on the exteriors of peds.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid, and some pedons have subhorizons that are extremely acid.\nThe third part of the series control section (2BCg) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 0 to 2.  Redoximorphic concentrations commonly have colors with hue redder than 10YR.  The 2BCg horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Clay content is 35 to 60 percent and sand content is less than 15 percent.  Reaction typically is very strongly acid to moderately acid, but ranges to neutral in some pedons.\nThe lower part of the series control section (2Cg) has colors for the matrix and redoximorphic concentrations in the same range as stated for the 2BCg horizon.  The 2Cg horizon is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  It typically is stratified.  Clay content is 35 to 55 percent and sand content is less than 15 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons contain carbonates."

Beckwith soils contain less clay in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon and have higher B/C clay ratios and are in areas that have a mean annual soil temperature less than 56 degrees F.  Floraville soils contain less clay in the upper part of the B horizon.  Mariosa soils have fragic characteristics in the lower part of the B horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Okaw soils are on nearly level areas of lacustrine terraces and lake plains; mainly along major tributaries of the Mississippi River.  Some areas are subject to rare or common flooding for brief periods from March to June.  Slopes typically are 0 to 1 percent but range from 0 to 2 percent.  Okaw soils formed in the dominantly clayey lacustrine sediments and have a mantle of loess or other silty material between 10 and 20 inches in thickness.  The lacustrine sediments in and underlying the Okaw series are weathered to depths of 10 or 12 feet.  Below 80 inches the stratified lacustrine sediments have coarse structure and widely-spaced cleavage planes, clay films on faces of structural units and in channels, segregation of iron-manganese oxides, accumulation of secondary carbonates, and the presence of dark strata.  Mean annual temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 36 to 44 inches, frost-free period is 180 to 210 days, and elevation is 340 to 450 feet above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Bartelso soils and the poorly drained Lakaskia soils have mollic epipedons and typically have a slightly thicker silty mantle.  The moderately well drained Colp soils and the somewhat poorly drained Hurst soils are on more sloping parts of the landform and they form a hydrosequence with the poorly drained Okaw soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Geff soils and the well drained Ridgway soils contain less clay and more sand in the control section and are on high flood plains and stream terraces nearby.  Wabash soils have a mollic epipedon greater than 36 inches in thickness and are in old oxbows and drainageways.  The poorly drained Wagner soils are in slightly depressional areas adjacent to the Okaw soils.  The dark Lakaskia soils and the moderately dark Wagner soils form a biosequence with the light-colored Okaw soils."

Albic horizon - from a depth of 7 to 15 inches (Eg1 and Eg2 horizons).\nAlbaqualf feature - abrupt textural change from the Eg2 horizon to the 2Btg horizon.\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of approximately 15 to 31 inches (2Btg horizon).\nAquic conditions - periodic saturation and reduction indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil."
