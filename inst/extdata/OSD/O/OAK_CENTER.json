  "OVERVIEW": "The Oak Center series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of loess over siliceous sandy residuum and sandstone bedrock.  These soils are on linear and convex slopes on interfluves and side slopes on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 863 millimeters.",
