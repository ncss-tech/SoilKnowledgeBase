  "OVERVIEW": "The Ostler series consists of deep well drained soils that formed in material weathered from tuffaceous sandstone, tuffaceous siltstone and tuffaceous limestone. These soils are on hillslopes of foothills. Slopes are 20 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
