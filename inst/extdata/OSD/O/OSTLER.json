    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.   The combined thickness of the A1 and B2t horizons is 35 to more than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 45 degress to 47 degrees F.  The mean summer temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 68 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 50 to 70 consecutive days during the summer.  The A1 horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.   It ranges from loam in the upper part to loam, light clay loam, or light silty clay loam in the lower part.\nThe A1 horizon is slightly acid to neutral and is 6 to 18 inches thick.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist.  It ranges from clay or silty clay to heavy caly loam, sandy clay loam or heavy silty clay loam.  Clay films are common to many thin to moderately thick in the jB2t horizon.   This horizon is medium acid to neutral, and ranges from 31 to more than 50 inches thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR  or 2.5Y, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.  It is heavy loam, silt loam, heavy sandy clay loam or heavy silty clay loam, gravelly light clay loam or light silty clay loam ahd has 0 to 20 percent soft pebbles.  This horizon is noncalcareous to strongly calcareous and medium acid to strongly alkaline."

Dumecq and Manila soils have hue of 5YR in the B2t horizon.  Marsden soils occur in an 11 to 14 inch precipitation zone and are dry more than 90 days during the summer, and have solums less than 35 inches thick.  Rands soils have a solum less than 35 inches thick over coarse sandy loam C horizons."

The soil formed in residuum, colluvium, and alluvium weathered from tuffaceous sandstone, siltstone and limestone.  Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 6,700 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 22 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F.  Freeze-free period is about 80 to 100 days."
