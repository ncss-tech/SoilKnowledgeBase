  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Bergen series. Bergen soils do not have substantial layers of limnic sediments. McGuffey and Roundhead series are in closely related families. McGuffey soils have illitic clay mineralogy and average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Roundhead soils have carbonates in the upper part of the series control section and are not formed in coprogenous earth."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Olentangy soils are in depressional areas associated with glacial lakes on till plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in limnic sediments (coprogenous earth) 61 to 127 cm (24 to 50 inches) thick and are underlain by lacustrine material or till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 787 to 1016 mm (31 to 40 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (48 to 54 degrees F)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bono, Carlisle, Linwood, Luray, Muskego, and Toledo soils. Bono, Luray, and Toledo soils formed entirely in lake sediments and are on adjacent lake plains. Carlisle and Linwood soils are on similar landscape positions. Carlisle soils formed entirely in organic materials. Linwood soils formed in organic materials but are underlain by loamy material. Muskego soils are on similar landscape positions but have thicker organic materials overlying the coprogenous earth."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high throughout the coprogenous material and moderately low in the mineral substratum. Permeability is moderate throughout the coprogenous material and slow in the mineral substratum."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The Olentangy soils are used for cropland and habitat for wetland wildlife. Drained areas are used for corn and soybeans and specialty crops such as potatoes, onions, and beans. Native vegetation is marshy types, namely grasses, reeds, sedges with some shrubs, and hardwoods."
