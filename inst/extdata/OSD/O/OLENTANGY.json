  "OVERVIEW": "The Olentangy series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in coprogenous earth and underlain by lake sediments or till at a depth of 61 to 127 cm (24 to 50 inches). These soils are in depressions on lakebeds and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",

McGuffey soils have illitic clay mineralogy and average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Roundhead soils have carbonates in the upper part of the series control section and are not formed in coprogenous earth."

Bono, Luray, and Toledo soils formed entirely in lake sediments and are on adjacent lake plains. Carlisle and Linwood soils are on similar landscape positions. Carlisle soils formed entirely in organic materials. Linwood soils formed in organic materials but are underlain by loamy material. Muskego soils are on similar landscape positions but have thicker organic materials overlying the coprogenous earth."
