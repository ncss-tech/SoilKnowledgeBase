Patter soils are moist in the upper part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October and have calcareous and strongly alkaline Bw horizons.  Prineville soils are deep to paralithic contacts and have 5 to 30 percent sand-size pumiceous ash grains in the upper part of the soil.

These soils formed in loess high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,160 to 2,140 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."

Oxcorel soils are fine, have natric horizons, and a typic aridic moisture regime. Rad soils are coarse-silty.  Rebel soils do not have horizons with 20 percent or more durinodes.  Snapp soils are clayey over sandy or sandy-skeletal and have natric horizons."
