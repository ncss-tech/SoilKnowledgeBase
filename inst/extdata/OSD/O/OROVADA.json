  "OVERVIEW": "The Orovada series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess high in volcanic ash over alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Orovada soils are on fan skirts, fan remnants, fan aprons, inset fans, calderas, and draws.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
