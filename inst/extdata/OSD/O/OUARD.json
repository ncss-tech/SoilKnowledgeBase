  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 36 degrees to 47 degrees F. The mean summer soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  Depth to soft shale is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate is 7 to 13 inches.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 15 percent.  Thickness of the solum is 10 to 20 inches and commonly rests on bedded shale.  A few pedons have a C horizon above the bedded shale.  The A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR; value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR; value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist; and chroma of 3 through 5 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is sandy clay loam averaging between 20 and 28 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  It commonly has moderate grade prismatic and angular blocky structure.  Some pedons have weak or strong prisms.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.  The B3ca horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."
