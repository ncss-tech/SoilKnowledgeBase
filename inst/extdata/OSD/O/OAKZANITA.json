  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Oakzanita series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from material weathering from gabbro and other igneous rocks. Oakzanita soils are on hillslopes and mountain slopes and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 720 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
