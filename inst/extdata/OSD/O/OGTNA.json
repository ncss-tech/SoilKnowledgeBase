  "OVERVIEW": "The Ogtna series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in stratified sandy and silty alluvium over sand and gravel.  Ogtna soils are on low stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 16 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  MAST ranges from 32 to 35 degrees F.  The upper part of the control section is stratified very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, silt loam and muck.  The composite texture contains less than 18 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Depth to sand and gravel ranges from 12 to 22 inches.  The lower part of the control section is sand or coarse sand with occasional strata of sandy loam and silt loam. Composite texture is sandy and coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 75 percent rounded gravel and cobble.  The soil is strongly acid to moderately acid solum and slightly acid to neutral in the 2C horizons.\nThe A/Oa horizons have moist value of 2 or 3; and moist chroma from 1 through 3.  Texture includes stratified very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam with muck and mucky peat.\nThe 2C horizon is variegated Coarse fragment content ranges from 40 to 75 percent with 35 to 65 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobble."
