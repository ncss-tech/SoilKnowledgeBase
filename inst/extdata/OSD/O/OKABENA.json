  "REVDATE": "06/2009",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Okabena series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in 100 to 150 centimeters of silty lacustrine sediments or loess and in the underlying till. These soils are on nearly level to convex slopes on lake plains or moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
