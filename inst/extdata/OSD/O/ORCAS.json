  "OVERVIEW": "The Orcas series consists of very deep, very poorly drained organic soils formed from sphagnum moss. Orcas soils occupy depressions on the glacial drift plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Orcas soils are in depressions on glacial outwash plains at elevations of 0 to 1,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in sphagnum moss with some herbaceous plants. The water table is near the surface most of the year. The soils are in humid climates that have cool, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 90 inches, most of which falls between October and April. Some snow falls in winter. Mean January temperature is 38 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 60 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. The frost free season is 160 to 240 days."

Alderwood, Everett, and Harstine soils are moderately well and somewhat excessively drained mineral soils. Norma and Bellingham soils are poorly drained mineral soils. Mukilteo soils are dominantly hemic soil material. Shalcar soils have 16 to 50 inches of sapric material over mineral soil."
