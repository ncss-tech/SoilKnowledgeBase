These soils formed in mixed alluvium from lacustrine deposits and volcaniclastic materials.  Slopes are 1 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches, most of which falls during winter months.  The average annual temperature is 48 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 120 to 150 days."
