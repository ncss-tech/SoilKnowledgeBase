  "OVERVIEW": "The Ornea series consists of very deep, well drained soils on fan terraces.  They formed in mixed alluvium from lacustrine deposits and volcaniclastic materials.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Slopes range from 1 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
