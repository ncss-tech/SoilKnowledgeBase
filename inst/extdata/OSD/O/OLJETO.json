  "OVERVIEW": "The Oljeto series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone and shale. Oljeto soils are on alluvial fans and terraces and have slopes of 1 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

These soils formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone and shale. The climate is arid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 10 inches. The mean annual temperature is 52 degrees to 56 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 72 degrees to 77 degrees F.  and the frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days."
