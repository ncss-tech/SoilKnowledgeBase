These soils formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone and shale. The climate is arid and the average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 10 inches. The mean annual temperature is 52 degrees to 56 degrees F. The mean summer temperature is 72 degrees to 77 degrees F.  and the frost-free period ranges from 150 to 180 days."
