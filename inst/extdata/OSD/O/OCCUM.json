  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the coarse-textured substratum range from 20 to 40 inches.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent by volume in the solum and from 0 to 60 percent in the substratum.  Some pedons have up to 10 percent cobbles in the substratum.  Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is commonly fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but the range includes very fine sandy loam or loam in the upper part.  Some pedons have thin strata of loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  The Bw horizon has granular or subangular blocky structure, or it is massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable.  Some pedons have thin Ab horizons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Some pedons have redoximorphic features below a depth of 4 feet.  Texture of individual layers ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction.  Included in some pedons are thin loamy and/or extremely gravelly strata.  Also, some pedons have a loamy C horizon layer just below the Bw horizon.  The C horizon is single grain and loose in the sandy part.  The loamy part is typically massive and friable.   The thickness and number of subhorizons is variable and corresponds to the thickness and variability of\nthe alluvial deposits."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Occum soils are nearly level soils on flood plains, along rivers and streams.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in recent alluvium derived mostly from gneiss, granite, and schist.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches but the range includes as low as 26 inches in some places east of Adirondack Mountains in the Champlain Valley of New York. The growing season ranges from 115 to 190 days."

The moderately well drained Pootatuck and the poorly drained Rippowam soils are associated in a drainage sequence.  Agawam, Enfield, Haven, and Merrimac soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon with depth.  Hadley and Hamlin soils are coarse-silty.  Pootatuck soils have low chroma mottles within a 24 inch depth.  Hinckley and Windsor soils are on nearby terraces and outwash plains.  Lim, Limerick, Saco, and Winooski soils are wetter silty floodplain associates.  Suncook soils are sandy, excessively drained soils on floodplains."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the loamy layers and high or very high in the sandy substratum. Many areas of these soils flood for short periods each year, but typically not during the growing season.  The soils on higher positions flood occasionally."
