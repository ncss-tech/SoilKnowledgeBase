  "OVERVIEW": "The Orion series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in 50 to 150 centimeters of recently deposited, stratified, alluvium overlying a buried soil. These soils are on flood plains, drainageways, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 950 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
