  "STATES": "MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Onota series consists of well or moderately well drained soils formed in loamy deposits, 20 to 40 inches thick, overlying sandstone bedrock.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",
