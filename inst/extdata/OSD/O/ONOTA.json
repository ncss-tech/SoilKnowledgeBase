It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.  Reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or the gravelly analogues of these textures.  Reaction is very strongly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bs horizons have hues of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 3 or 4.  Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together.  They are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.  Some pedons have 10 to 20 percent of moderately cemented orstein.
