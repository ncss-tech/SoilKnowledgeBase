  "OVERVIEW": "The Orinoco series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
