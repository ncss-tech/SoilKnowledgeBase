Oterodry replaces the Otero series in the ustic-aridic moisture regime in MLRA 69.\nLAN/LLC/WAW 7/2012  Based on field experience and re-examination of available data the type location for Oterodry is being moved and the series reclassified as Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Ustic Haplocambid.  The range in characteristics and properties are based on field experience.  Competing series were updated to reflect the new classification.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
