  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oconee soils are on nearly level or gently sloping interfluves, convex summits, and the upper end of drainageways on the Illinoian till plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 7 percent.  These soils formed in 55 to more than 80 inches of loess.  The material beneath the loess is till or the silty pedisediment that lies above the till and contains a component of sand.  The loess is late Wisconsinan Peoria Loess and the underlying silty material is early Wisconsinan Roxana Silt.  The soils are underlain at depths of about 5 to 8 feet by Illinoian till that commonly contains a strongly developed paleosol.  Mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees F., mean annual soil temperature is 56 to 59 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 35 to 42 inches, frost-free period is 180 to 200 days, and elevation is 400 to 700 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Cowden, Darmstadt, Herrick, and Tamalco soils.  The poorly drained Cowden soils are on broad interfluves adjacent to Oconee soils.  They form a hydrosequence with Oconee soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Darmstadt and moderately well drained Tamalco soils have natric horizons.  Darmstadt soils are on similar landform positions as Oconee soils.  Tamalco soils are on convex summits and side slopes of drainageways nearby and commonly are upslope from Oconee soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Herrick soils have a mollic epipedon and are further from the drainageways."

    "content": "REMARKS: In pedons with less than 80 inches of loess, the lower part of the soil formed in silty pedisediment that contains a component of sand and/or in the underlying Illinoian till that commonly contains a strongly developed paleosol. These horizons or strata typically are silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam, but color, texture, and thickness of these layers is quite variable.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nOchric epipedon - from the surface of the soil to a depth of 16 inches (Ap, E1, and E2 horizons);\nAlbic horizon - from a depth of approximately 8 to 16 inches (E1 and E2 horizons);\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of approximately 16 to 58 inches (Bt/E, Bt, Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons);\nAquic conditions - periodic saturation and reduction, indicated by redoximorphic features throughout the soil.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
