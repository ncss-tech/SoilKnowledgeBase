  "OVERVIEW": "The Onahu series consists of deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over till derived from granitic rocks, gneiss, and schist.  Onahu soils are on mountain slopes and cirque basins.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 35 degrees F.",

(parts of the A2, 2Bg and parts of the 2Cg horizons)\nRedoximorphic concentrations and depletions:  In the zone from 16 to 45 inches. (2Bg and 2Cg horizons)\nEpisaturation:  The zone of saturation at 16 to 45 inches, inferred from the low chroma of the soil matrix. (2Bg and 2Cg horizons). The zone of saturation is perched on the paralithic contact.\nParalithic contact:  The contact with gneiss and schist at 45 inches.  (3Cr layer)\nTaxonomic Version:  Eighth Edition\nThe mineralogy class was changed from paramicaceous to micaceous in 07/2010 by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the responsible MLRA regional office.  The change was necessary based on the eleventh edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
