  "OVERVIEW": "The Ortellcreek series consists of moderately deep to deep to densic material, well drained soils formed in glacial till from sedimentary and some volcanic rock with a mantle of volcanic ash.  These soils are on back slopes and foot slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
