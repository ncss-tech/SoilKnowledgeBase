Boomstick soils are dominated by channers or flagstones in the particle-size control section.  Checkett soils are effervescent throughout.  Chubard and Richinde soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.  Cottle, Doorkiss, and Soughe soils are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section.  Fortyday and Olac soils are noneffervescent throughout and do not have identifiable secondary carbonates in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  Hooplite soils are effervescent throughout and are dominated by gravel in the particle-size control section.  Nevo soils do not have horizons with identifiable secondary carbonates and have secondary silica coats on the lithic contact.  Phliss soils are dominated by channers in the particle-size control section.  Rowel soils have argillic horizons with 40 to 55 percent clay.  Stewval soils are effervescent throughout and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms.  Thike soils are dominated by granitic rock fragments and have 12 to 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Old Camp soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks with an amount of eolian material derived from volcanic ash.  Slopes are 2 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,340 to 2,130 meters in northern latitudes and to 2,195 meters in southern latitudes.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 330 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
