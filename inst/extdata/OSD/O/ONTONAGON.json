  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 35 inches and commonly is the same as the depth of carbonates.  Total rock fragments, mainly gravel, is less than 1 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR; value of 2 to 4; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Where present, the Ap horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A or Ap horizon is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a separate E horizon or E/B horizon above the B/E horizon. The E horizon and E part of the B/E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5YR; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe B part of the B/E horizon has colors and textures similar to those of the Bt horizon. Reaction of the B/E horizon ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 2 to 6.  It commonly averages between 75 and 85 percent clay but ranges from 60 to 85 percent clay. Reaction of the Bt horizon ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BC horizon has colors and textures similar to those of the Bt horizon. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dominant hues of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 10R; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 4.  The clay content of the C horizon generally exceeds 60 percent.  The very thin horizontal seams of silty material in the lower part of the C horizon have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction of the C horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Ontonagon soils are on glacial lake plains.  Slopes range from 6 to 50 percent.  Slopes of 30 to 50 percent are found on sideslopes or escarpments of stream-cut ravines.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 34 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F."

The poorly drained Bergland and Pickford soils are in depressions, and the somewhat poorly drained Rudyard soils are in slightly lower landscape positions.  The Bergland, Pickford and Rudyard soils form a drainage sequence with the Ontonagon soils.  Superior, Allendale, and Manistee soils have thin loamy or sandy smears overlying similar materials and are associated in some areas.  Allendale soils are in slightly lower landscape positions and the Superior and Manistee soils are on similar landscape positions."

The native vegetation included American basswood, eastern white pine, eastern hemlock, northern white cedar, white spruce, sugar maple, and yellow birch. Cut over areas are in second growth quaking aspen."
