    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The soil temperature is warmer than 47 degrees F from January 30 through December 1.  The soil between 8 and 24 inches is moist throughout from about December 1 to May 1 and dry throughout from about July 1 to Novembert 1 in most years. Depth to the paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  Segregated lime is present in most pedons throughout the profile as soft masses, filaments, or concretions.  The A horizon is 15 to 26 inches thick.  Organic matter is 1 to 3 percent in the A horizon, but in pedons where the A horizon is over 20 inches thick the organic matter is less than 1 percent below 20 inches.  Clay content is 12 to 18 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 2/2, 3/2 or 3/3.  The upper A horizon is fine sandy loam.  The lower part is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam. It is slightly or strongly effervescent.\nThe C horizon is 10YR 4/3, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2 or 6/3.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3 or 4/4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  It is strongly or violently effervescent."

These soils formed in material weathered from calcareous sandstones of the Panoche formation.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches. The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 79 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.

They are being differentiated by being coarse-loamy and moderately deep.  pH determined by colormetric method using Thymol Blue and Hellige-Truog Triplex indicators.  Texture determined by hydrometer method.  Organic matter estimated by comparing with adjacent soils determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.  Presence of lime determined by 10 percent HC1.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
