    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 21 to 40 inches. Thickness of the solum ranges from 12 inches to the base of the bedrock.\nThe mean annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 50 F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 66 degrees to 69 F. These soils are dry in the moisture control section more than half the time the soil temperature is above 41 F. and are continually dry for 60 to 75 days during the summer in 7 or more years in 10.  The moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry 2 or 3 moist and chroma is 2 or 3. It has 40 to 80 percent gravel and cobbles, mostly angular. Texture is extremely gravelly loam or extremely cobbly loam.  Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, chroma is 2 or 3. Texture is gravelly loam or gravelly clay loam. The horizon is 0 to 5 percent cobbles and 15 to 20 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4. It has moderate, coarse to fine subangular blocky structure. Texture is very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay. The horizon is 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 30 to 40 percent gravel. Reaction is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is very cobbly sandy clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly sandy clay loam, or very gravelly loam. This horizon is 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 25 to 30 percent gravel. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline. It is strongly or violently effervescent."

The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F. The mean summer temperature ranges from 67 to 70 degrees F. and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
