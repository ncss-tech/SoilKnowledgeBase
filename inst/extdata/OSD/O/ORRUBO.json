    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Orrubo soils are on summits and side slopes of fan terraces, fan remnants and ballenas at elevations of 1,400 to 2,300 feet.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from calcareous fanglomerate.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 9 inches and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains during December and January.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 210 to 280 days."
