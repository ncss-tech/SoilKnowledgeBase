  "OVERVIEW": "The Orrubo series consists of very shallow and shallow to a petrocalcic, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from calcareous fanglomerate.  Orrubo soils are on summits and side slopes of ballenas, fan remnants and fan terraces.  Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F.",
