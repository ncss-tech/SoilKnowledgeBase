Holsine soils lack B horizons and have extremely gravelly nonconforming layer near the surface.  Lariat soils are moderately deep to fractured sandstone.  Lidy and Sparmo soils are moderately deep to extremely gravelly material.  Malm soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Matheson soils have basalt bedrock at 46 inches and less than 5 percent rock fragments.  Voltage soils have annual soil temperatures of 45 to 47 degrees F. and have less than 5 percent rock fragments."
