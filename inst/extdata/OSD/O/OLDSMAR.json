  "OVERVIEW": "The Oldsmar series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in sandy marine sediments overlying loamy materials. Oldsmar soils are on flatwoods, low broad flats, and depressions on marine terraces. Slopes are linear to concave and range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C. (72 degrees F).",
