  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to shale bedrock ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 12 to 18 inches and extends into the Bt horizon.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 to 2 inches wide and several feet long extend through the solum.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam and neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay or clay averaging between 40 and 55 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Btk and Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are silty clay or clay averaging between 45 and 60 percent clay.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C and Cr horizons have hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 1 or 2.  The C horizon is clay averaging between 50 and 60 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Bands of yellowish brown, brown and redder colors are typical of the bedrock."

Mosher soils have a natric horizon and are on slightly lower parts of the landscape.  Norrest soils do not have a mollic epipedon. Opal soils are on similar landscapes and do not have an argillic horizon. Orella and Sansarc soils have bedrock at depths of less than 20 inches and do not have an argillic horizon.  Norrest, Orella, and Sansarc soils are on higher parts of the landscape."
