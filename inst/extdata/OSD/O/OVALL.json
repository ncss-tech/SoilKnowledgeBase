  "OVERVIEW": "The Ovall series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in glacial drift mixed with residuum and colluvium from andesite and breccia.  These soils are on glaciated foothills and mountains with slopes of 0 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is 10 to 15 percent clay.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section range from 35 to 60 percent by volume and are dominantly rounded.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry; and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry.  It contains 15 to 30 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR, or 10YR moist or dry, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 to 6 dry; and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  Textures are very gravelly loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  This horizon contains 30 to 45 percent pebbles and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.\nSome pedons have a C horizon, which has colors and textures similar to the  B horizon, and is massive."

Elevations range from 500 to 1,800 feet.  These soils formed in glacial drift mixed with residuum and colluvium from andesite and breccia.  The climate is marine influenced, with cool, moist winters and relatively cool, dry summers.  The mean January temperature is 37 degrees F; mean July temperature is 63 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 51 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation is 45 to 60 inches.  The frost-free season (32 degrees F) is 140 to 160 days."

Alderwood soils have an ortstein layer at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Barneston soils are sandy-skeletal.  Beausite soils have a spodic horizon.  Buckley soils have an aquic moisture regime and are fine-loamy.  Mashel soils have an argillic horizon and more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Seattle soils are Histosols and are very poorly drained.  Wilkeson soils have an argillic horizon and are fine-loamy."
