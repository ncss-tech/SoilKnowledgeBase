  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Free carbonates extend to depths of 10 to 30 inches.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 28 percent and, in some pedons, the AC horizon contains free carbonates.\nThe Ak horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 and 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 0 to 1.  It typically is a loam but the range includes sandy loam, fine sandy loam or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe AC horizon has faint or distinct redoximorphic features ranging from reddish yellow to yellowish brown.  It typically is loamy fine sand or loamy sand but range includes fine sandy loam or sand.  It is neutral in horizons lacking free carbonates and moderately alkaline where there are free carbonates.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features are distinct or prominent and range from dark brown to yellow.  Common reddish brown masses of iron-manganese are throughout the C horizon.  The C horizon commonly is sand but ranges from loamy fine sand to sand.  Thin stratified finer textured sediments are in some pedons."

The Elsmere, Leshara, Ord, and Ovina soils lack calcic horizons and have lower water tables during the growing season.  Elsmere and Ovina soils are on slightly higher landscapes and Ovina soils are coarse-loamy.  Leshara soils are fine-silty and on similar landscapes.  Ord soils are fine-loamy and Loup soils lack calcic horizons and both are on similar positions on the landscape."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon--the zone from the surface to a depth of approximately 18 inches (Ak horizon); calcic horizon--0 to 18 inches (Ak horizon); and aquic condition--redoximorphic features were at a depth of 18 to 60 inches.\nThe Orwet soils now include the poorly drained soils with calcic horizons formerly included in the Ord and Wann series.\nIn Nebraska, the native vegetative cover is an herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with sedges (Carex emoryi, C. laeviconica, C. pellita, C. vulpinoidea), flat stem spikerush, (Eleocharis compressa), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa Pratensis), prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinate).
