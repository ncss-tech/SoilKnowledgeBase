  "OVERVIEW": "The Obadia series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  Obadia soils are on toe slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
