  "OVERVIEW": "The Ossagon series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial, beach, and dune deposits derived from mixed sources. Ossagon soils are on mountains and hills and have slopes of 9 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1900 millimeters (75 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1520 to 2290 millimeters (60 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 13 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F).
