  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ossagon soils occur on mountain slopes, sideslopes of hill and on broad ridges. Slopes are 9 to 50 percent. Elevations are 6 to 593 meters (15 to 1945 feet). The soils formed in colluvium and residuum from weakly consolidated fluvial, beach, and dune deposits derived from mixed sources. The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters. Coastal influence limits the annual and diurnal range in temperature. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1520 to 2290 millimeters (60 to 90 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 13 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is 240 to 325 days."

Mettah and Surpur soils are found on broad ridge tops at higher elevations, farther inland."
