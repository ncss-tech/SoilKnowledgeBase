  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Soil reaction ranges from extremely acid to medium acid in all horizons.  Texture is sand or fine sand in all horizons except the Bh horizon which includes loamy sand or loamy fine sand.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 3.  In many pedons an incipient A2 horizon about 2 inches thick is between the A1 or Ap horizon and the Bh horizon.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; hue of 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2; hue of 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2; or is neutral with value of 2.  In some pedons it is mottled in shades of brown, black, or gray. Sand grains are thinly to thickly coated with organic matter in this horizon.  A 3 to 15 inch thick B3 horizon is in some pedons. It has hue of 5YR, value of 4, and chroma of 4; hue of 7.5YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3; or hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  In many pedons, bodies of Bh material are in this horizon.  Some pedons have a bisequum of E and B'h horizons below the Bh horizon and may not have the C horizon as described.\nSome pedons have B/C horizons with hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 4; or hue of 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 2."

Basinger soils have a Bh & A horizon.  EauGallie, Tocoi, Wabasso, and Wauchula soils have an argillic horizon.  Immokalee soils have A horizons more than 30 inches thick.

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Ona soils are poorly drained. Permeability of the Bh horizon is moderate.  Runoff is slow and internal drainage is impeded by the water table.  The water table is at depths of 10 to 40 inches for periods of 4 to 6 months during most years.  It rises to depths of less than 10 inches for periods of 1 to 2 months and may recede to depths of more than 40 inches during very dry seasons."
