  "OVERVIEW": "The Opolis series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of silty loess over residuum on plains in the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 57 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.",
