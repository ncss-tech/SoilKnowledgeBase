These soils formed in colluvium derived mainly from tuffs of the Duff and Pruett Formations.  Lesser amounts of rock fragments are from the Mitchell Mesa Ignimbrite, the Cottonwood Springs Basalt, and the Crossen Trachyte.  Slopes range from 20 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 15 inches, with most occurring July through September.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 210 to 260 days, and elevation ranges from 3,500 to 5,000 feet."

Borunda soils are moderately deep to weathered tuff bedrock, have calcic and gypsic horizons, and are in the fine-loamy family.  They are on lower gently undulating uplands.  Gemelo soils are very deep, have cambic horizons, and are in the coarse-loamy family.  They are on lower alluvial fan aprons.  Lingua soils are shallow and very shallow to basalt bedrock, and are on higher erosional slopes, hills and scarps.  Reduff soils are shallow and very shallow to red tuff and are on adjacent erosional slopes, hills, and scarps.  Scotal soils are shallow and very shallow to white tuff and are on adjacent erosional slopes, hills, and scarps."
