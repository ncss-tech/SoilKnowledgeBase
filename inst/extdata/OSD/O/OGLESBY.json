(0 to 10 inches thick)\nR--16 to 24 inches; indurated limestone with a hardness by Mohs scale of 3 or more; upper part has coarse fractures filled with soil material, below the bedrock has tight fractures and it cannot be excavated with a backhoe machine."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 10 to 20 inches. The average clay content is 40 to 50 percent.  Limestone fragments less than 3 inches to about 25 inches across range from none to a few on the surface up to about 10 percent by volume in the solum.  Some pedons have a few chert fragments of similar size.  The reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline and noncalcareous. The dry soil cracks more than 1 cm wide throughout and has a COLE of more than 0.07. The soil is dry in some part of the moisture control section for less than 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The A2 horizon ranges from 5YR to 10YR with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 1 to 4.  The A1 and A2 horizons are silty clay or clay.\nThe R horizon is inducted limestone that is coarsely fractured."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Harper series in the same family.  Similar soils include Eckrant, Purves, Stephen and Tarrant series.  Harper soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.  Eckrant and Tarrant soils have over 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section, and in addition Tarrant soils have a calcic horizon.  Purves soils have a calcic horizon and are calcareous throughout.  Stephen soils have mixed mineralogy and are underlain by a paralithic contact of chalky limestone."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Oglesby soils are on nearly level or gently sloping uplands.  Surfaces are typically plane to slightly benched with slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Oglesby soils formed mainly in the Kiamichi Clay and Edwards Limestone undivided formations of the Lower Cretaceous Period.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 34 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F. Frost free days range from 220 to 260 days and elevation ranges from 850 to 1250 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 44 to 56."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",

Bolar soils are moderately deep, loamy soils on side slopes, and ridgetops, upslope from Oglesby soils.  Crawford soils have a sola 20 to 40 inches thick and are on similar surfaces.  Denton soils are deep soils on side slopes, upslope from Oglesby soils."
