    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The water held at 15 bars is estimated (from field moisture content) it be greater than 100 percent of the dry weight of the natural undried soil in the A, Bw and BC horizons. The soil is slightly acid to strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It is 0 to 3 percent gravel-size cinders.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry. It is clay loam or silty clay loam and is 3 to 10 percent gravel-size cinders.\nThe 2BC and 2CB horizons have hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. The 2CB horizon consists of saprolitic cinders. The texture ranges from paragravelly silt loam to very paragravelly sandy loam after hand crushing. Less than 15 percent rock fragments remain after sample preparation and dispersion for laboratory analysis."

Elevation is 400 to 1500 feet. The mean annual rainfall is 175 to 230 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 78 degrees F."

Fragments all break down in lab data. No hydrous over medial family at this time. That family could (should) be proposed if many series have this combination.\nTaxonomic Version: Second edition Soil Taxonomy, 1999.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory are available on this pedon National Soil Survey Laboratory, pedon number S81AS020010 was sampled and analysis was performed by the SCS in 1981.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
