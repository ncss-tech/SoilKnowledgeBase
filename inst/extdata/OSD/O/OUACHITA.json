  "REVDATE": "06/2010",
  "STATES": "AR,LA,MS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Ouachita series consists of deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy alluvium. These level to nearly level soils are on flood plains and natural levees along streams in the Western Coastal Plains. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F) and the mean annual precipitation is about 1270 mm (50 in).",
