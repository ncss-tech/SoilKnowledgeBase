  "OVERVIEW": "The Ortonville series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in calcareous loamy glacial till. Permeability is moderate.  These soils are on ground moraines and till plains.  They have slopes ranging from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

Esmond and Heimdal are well drained and are on higher lying positions. Emrick soils are moderately well drained on landscape positions similar to Ortonville. Wyard soils are in somewhat poorly drained swales and shallow depressions. They do not have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches. Parnell and Tonka soils are in deep depressions. They have argillic horizons."
