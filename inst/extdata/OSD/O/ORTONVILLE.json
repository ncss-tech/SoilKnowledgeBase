  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 18 inches in thickness.  The soil contains 1 to 10 percent rock fragments, by volume, throughout.  The clay content ranges from 8 to 18 percent, and the sand content ranges from 40 to 65 percent throughout.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.\nA calcic horizon occurs within 16 inches of the surface.  The calcic horizon(s) has less than 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe Ap, Apk or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 through 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or in some geomorphic areas is stratified loam, silt loam and sandy loam. The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 25 percent. Some pedons have a BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. It is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or in some geormorphic areas is stratified loam, silt loam and sandy loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Ortonville soils are on low knolls on ground moraines and till plains.  Slopes are short with gradients of 1 to 6 percent.  The soil is formed in calcareous loamy glacial till of the Wisconsin Age.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 27 inches. The frost free days range from 120 to 170 days.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 850 to 1950 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Emrick, Esmond, Fram, Heimdal, Parnell, Tonka, and Wyard soils. Fram soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on flats. Esmond and Heimdal are well drained and are on higher lying positions. Emrick soils are moderately well drained on landscape positions similar to Ortonville. Wyard soils are in somewhat poorly drained swales and shallow depressions. They do not have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches. Parnell and Tonka soils are in deep depressions. They have argillic horizons."
