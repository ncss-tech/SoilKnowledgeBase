  "OVERVIEW": "The Oviatt series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in a mixture of volcanic ash and material weathered from granite.  Oviatt soils are on mountains and have slopes of 35 to 75 percent.  They have moderate in the surface and rapid in the substratum permeability.  The average annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
