These soils formed in a mixture of volcanic ash and material weathered from granite.   The average annual temperature varies from about 40 to 45 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation varies from about 30 to 35 inches and the frost free period is about 80 to 100 days."

Aldermand soils are on similar landscapes on concave positions and have volcanic ash mantles.  Crumarine soils are on bottomlands and are somewhat poorly drained.  Kauder soils are on undulating foothills and have a volcanic ash mantle and a fragipan.  Spokane soils are on south and west-facing convex slopes and have mesic soil temperature regimes.  Uvi soils are on similar landscapes and are fine-loamy."
