  "OVERVIEW": "The Okanogan series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium of mixed mineralogy.  These soils are on flood plains, low stream terraces, and broad alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F.  The moisture regime is xeric bordering on aridic. These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section is 15 to 30 percent sand coarser than very fine and 0 to 10 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to more than 40 inches.  Organic matter decreases irregularly with depth. Some pedons have secondary carbonates below a depth of about 44 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe AC and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry, 2 through 4 moist.  They are silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.  The lower part of the C horizon in some pedons is stratified with lenses of sand 1/2 to 3 inches thick.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

Coxlake soils are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60consecutive days.  Endersby soils are more than 30 percent sand coarser than very fine in the particle-size control section. Evans soils are slightly acid in the control section.  Leavenworth and Patit Creek soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days.  In addition, Patit Creek soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the particle- size control section.  Narcisse soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days.  Pleasant View soils are gravelly in the particle-size control section and have secondary lime in the Ck horizon.  Poween soils are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days.  Redola soils ar calcareous throughout."

Aeneas and Pogue soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy- skeletal.  Cashmere, Cashmont, and Tonasket soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Ellisforde soils are coarse-silty.   Monse soils are fine-silty and are in the aquic subgroup.  Quincy and Skaha soils lack a mollic epipedon. Strat soils are loamy-skeletal.  In addition, all of these soils have a regular decrease in organic matter."

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are a mollic epipedon from the surface to 31 inches and an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth (inferred from the stratified nature of the parent material)."
