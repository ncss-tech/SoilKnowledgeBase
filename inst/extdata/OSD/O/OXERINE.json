  "OVERVIEW": "The Oxerine series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from metamorphic rock with a mantle of volcanic ash; some with minor amounts of glacial till. These soils are on footslopes, backslopes, shoulders, and ridges of hills and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 46 degrees F. The volcanic ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick, has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples. Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Typically, these soils are neutral or slightly acid. Reaction of the calcareous substratum phase is neutral to slightly alkaline in the solum and slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. It is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy silt loam or ashy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is ashy silt loam, ashy fine sandy loam, gravelly ashy loam, gravelly ashy fine sandy loam, channery ashy loam, or channery ashy silt loam. It averages 5 to 30 percent rock fragments, with 5 to 25 percent channers, 0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent flagstones and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. It is very channery loam, very gravelly loam, very flaggy loam, extremely gravelly loam,  or very cobbly loam. Soils with a calcareous substratum are loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, and are very gravelly, extremely gravelly, or very stony. It averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments, with 0 to 45 percent channers, 0 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 20 percent flagstones, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones. The 2Bw horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. It is sandy loam or loam and is channery, very flaggy, extremely flaggy, very gravelly, very cobbly, extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly. Soils with a calcareous substratum are fine sandy loam or loamy sand and are very gravelly or extremely gravelly.

Newhorn soils are 20 to 40 inches to a densic contact. Piutespring and Wonder soils are dry for 45 to 60 days following the summer solstice.  Redriver soils are dry for 90 consecutive days. Veridge soils have less than 10 percent clay in the particle-size control and have 35 to 55 percent sedimentary rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Wilma soils have 35 to 65 percent granitic rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

They formed in residuum and colluvium from schist, graywacke, phylitte, and quartzite, with a mantle of volcanic ash; some with minor amounts of glacial till. Oxerine soils formed from limestone and dolomite are mapped as a calcareous substratum phase. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 33 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.; and the frost free season is 90 to 120 days."

Edds soils are on plains and mountains slopes. Henneway soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of foothills and mountains. Merkel soils are on mountains. Pepoon soils have bedrock at less than 20 inches and are on glacially abraded mountain ridges, knolls, peaks and saddles. Raisio and Rufus soils are mesic and in addition Rufus soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to bedrock. Raisio and Rufus soils are on generally south-facing footslopes, sideslopes and ridgetops of mountains"
