  "OVERVIEW": "The Orofino series consists of very shallow and shallow to bedrock, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sands over residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Orofino soils are on hills. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 100 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C.",
