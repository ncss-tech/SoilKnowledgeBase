  "OVERVIEW": "The Ojito series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils that are moderately deep to interbedded sandstone and siltstone bedrock.  Ojito soils formed in eolian material, slope alluvium, and residuum derived from micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Ojito soils are on beveled summits, shoulders, and footslopes of ridges and hills.  Slopes are 5 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
