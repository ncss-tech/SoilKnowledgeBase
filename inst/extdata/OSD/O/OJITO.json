  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ojito soils are on beveled summits, shoulders, and footslopes of ridges and hills.  They formed in eolian material, alluvium, and residuum derived from Tertiary micaceous sandstone and siltstone.  Slopes are 5 to 25 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches with about 45 percent falling as rain from high-intensity convective thunderstorms between July and September.  The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 150 to 170 days."

Innacutt soils are very deep, do not have diagnostic horizons, and occur on inset fans and narrow flood plains of gulches.  Koshare soils are very deep and occur on adjacent toeslopes.  Quarteles soils are loamy, very shallow to soft bedrock, do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons, and occur on adjacent backslopes.  El Rancho soils are fine-silty, very deep, and occur on toeslopes of ridges and hills.  Walkibout soils are coarse-silty, very deep, and occur on side slopes of gulches."
