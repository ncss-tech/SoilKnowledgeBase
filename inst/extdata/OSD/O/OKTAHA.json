  "OVERVIEW": "The Oktaha series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed from loamy residuum of sandstone and thin strata of shale or siltstone of Pennsylvanian age.  These soils are on broad, smooth plateaus, mountain tops, or hill tops of the Boston Mountains, and Arkansas Valley and Ridges.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 62 degrees F.",
