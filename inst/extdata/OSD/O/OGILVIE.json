  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the upper loamy mantle is 20 to 40 inches.  Carbonates are below depths of 60 inches or more. The content of rock fragments in the loamy mantle range from 0 to 5 percent gravel, by volume, mostly less than 5mm in size. The 2Bt horizon in some pedons have up to 20 percent gravel. The 2C horizon contains from 5 to 50 percent rock fragments with some strata ranging to 65 percent. The rock fragments are of mixed lithology, but mostly of igneous origin.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2. It has faint to prominent redoximorphic features. It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Redoximorphic features are faint to prominent. It is loam or silt loam. The 2Bt horizon in some pedons is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or their gravelly analogues. It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a thin 2BC horizon less than 5 inches thick. It has colors similar to the Bt or 2C horizons. It is sandy loam, loamy sand or their gravelly analogues. Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value and chroma of 4 or 5. Redoximorphic features are faint to prominent. It is sand, coarse sand or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues. Stratification is common. It is strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Ogilvie soils are on plane to slightly concave positions on level outwash plains, valley trains and stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in a loamy mantle of lacustrine or aeolian sediments overlying Superior Lobe sandy and gravelly sediments of Late Wisconsinan Age. Mean annual temperature is 36 to 47 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation is 24 to 33 inches. Frost-free days range from 90 to 145. Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1400 feet."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
