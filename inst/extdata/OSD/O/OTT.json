Bluemount soils form in residuum of mafic crystalline rock in the southern piedmont. Mundeville soils form in acid micaceous shale. Nordon soils form in residuum of glauconitic sandstone. Whalan soils form in glacial till over limenstone. Coggon, Grellton, Nodine and Wykof soils are deep to bedrock. Coggon, Grellton and Wykof soils form in glacial deposits. Nodine soils form in loess over pedisediments. Caprell, Douds, Kendallville, Kliever, Letort, Lindley, McHenry, Pecatonia, Plumcreek, Renova, Rockbridge and Westville soils are very deep to bedrock. Caprell, Lindley, McHenry, Pecatonia, Renova and Westville soils form in loess over glacial till. Douds, Kliever and Plumcreek soils form in alluvium.
