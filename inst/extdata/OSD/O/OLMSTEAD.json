    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Olmstead soils are on level and concave depressions and drainageways within valleys of the Ouachita Mountains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent slopes.  Some areas have numerous mounds.  These soils formed in fluvial deposition from nearby hillsides which was deposited on top of predominately tilted, fractured and folded shale bedrock.  In most pedons a paleosol is present.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 41 to 56 inches with the highest amount being destributed in January to May.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 64 degrees F."
