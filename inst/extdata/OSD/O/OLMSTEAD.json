  "OVERVIEW": "The Olmstead series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy fluvial sediments from sandstone, shale and siltstone.  These level to nearly level soils are on depressions, drainageways within valleys of the Ouachita Mountains; MLRA 119. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.",

Some areas have numerous mounds.  These soils formed in fluvial deposition from nearby hillsides which was deposited on top of predominately tilted, fractured and folded shale bedrock.  In most pedons a paleosol is present.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 41 to 56 inches with the highest amount being destributed in January to May.
