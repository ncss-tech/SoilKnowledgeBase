  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth is 60 inches or more. The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 48 degrees F; mean July soil temperature is 49 to 62 degrees F.  The Soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from April 25 to November 20 and exceeds 47 degrees F from May 20 to November 1.  Between the depths of 8 and 24 inches, the soil is dry from mid-July until mid-October and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the year.  The amount of rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  Most are gravel size and less than 3/4 inch in diameter.  The upper 7 inches of the soil has dry value of 5.5 or more, and the organic carbon content ranges from 0.3 to 0.6 percent.  The soil is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Base saturation ranges from 50 to 80 percent and is greater than 60 percent in some part of the upper 30 inches of the soil.  The soil is sandy loam or loam with 10 to 18 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is grayish brown, brown, light brownish gray, or pale brown (10YR 5/2, 5/3, 6/2, 6/3).  Moist colors are very dark brown, very dark grayish brown, or dark brown (10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3).\nThe AC horizon is light brownish gray, pale brown, light gray or very pale brown (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3).  Moist colors are very dark grayish brown, dark brown, or dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3).\nThe C and Cq horizons are light brownish gray, pale brown, light gray, very pale brown, or white (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 8/2, 8/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2, 8/2).  Moist colors are very dark grayish brown, dark brown, or dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2).  Most pedons have slight brittleness but are moderately or strongly brittle in some part of the C horizon.  Cementation with silica is at depths of 40 to 60 inches and commonly becomes stronger with increasing depth.  Both the brittleness and cementation is discontinuous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Orset soils are on terraces of basins and streams.  Slopes are 0 to 9 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium from mixed extrusive igneous rock and volcanic ash.  The soils appear to have formed under poorer drainage conditions than currently exist.\nElevations are 4,500 to 6,000 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 50 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 12 to 24 inches.   Mean January temperature is 25 to 30 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 60 to 90 days."
