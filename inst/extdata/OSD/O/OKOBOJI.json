  "OVERVIEW": "The Okoboji series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium or lacustrine sediments. These soils are in closed depressions on till plains and moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 740 millimeters.",
