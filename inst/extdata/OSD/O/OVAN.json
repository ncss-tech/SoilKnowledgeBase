    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 80 inches thick.  In undisturbed areas there is gilgai microrelief with microknolls 4 to 8 inches above microdepressions.  Cycles of knolls and depressions are repeated each 8 to 23 feet.  Cracks 0.5 to 1 inch wide extend to a depth of more than 20 inches when the soil is dry. Intersecting slickensides begin at depths of 18 to 25 inches.  The soil is moderately alkaline and calcareous clay or silty clay with 40 to 55 percent clay.  Some pedons have thin grayish or brownish discontinuous clay or clay loam strata in the 10 to 40 inch control section.\nThe A horizon has colors in shades of brown hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Masses in shades of brown or olive range from none to common in the control section.\nColors of the B horizons are in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Brownish masses range from few to common in most pedons.\nThe C horizon, when present, is clayey with or without loamy strata.  It has gray, brown or olive colors."

Bleiblerville, Branyon, Burleson, Dimebox, Fairlie, Houston Black, Leson and Slidell soils have chroma of 1 throughout the upper 12 inches and are on uplands or terraces.  Clarita and Tamford soils have hue 7.5YR or redder in the subsoil.  Heiden, Luling and Sanger soils have a solum less than 80 inches thick.  Watonga soils have a solum less than 60 inches thick.  Kaufman and Tinn and Trinity soils have chroma of 1 in the upper 12 inches also Kaufman soils are noncalcareous."
