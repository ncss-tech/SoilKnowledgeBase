The particle-size control section averages 10 to 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser material.  These soils have an irregular distribution of organic matter with depth.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry.\nThe Bg and Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  More than 60 percent of the soil has a chroma of 2 between 10 and 30 inches.  It is moderately acid, slightly acid, or neutral silt loam or very fine sandy loam within 40 inches  The Cg horizon ranges to very strongly acid silty clay loam in some parts below 40 inches in some pedons.  Some pedons lack a B horizon."

Oridia soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers, and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."
