Reaction ranges from medium acid through neutral in each horizon. Content of coarse fragments ranges from 15 and 35 percent except some subhorizons contain up to 60 percent.\nTransition horizons have color and texture similar to adjacent horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Where the value and chroma are 3 or less , it is less than 10 inches thick. Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 or value of 3 and chroma of 4.  Most pedons have mottles in shades of brown in some subhorizons.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or clay loam.\nSome pedons have Ab horizons with hue of 10YR, value of 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR and 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Most pedons have mottles in shades of of gray, brown, and yellow.  Texture of the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or rarely sandy loam."
