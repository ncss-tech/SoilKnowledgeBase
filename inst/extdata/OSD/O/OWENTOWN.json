  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum is more than 80 inches. The reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid throughout unless limed. Base saturation ranges from 35 to 60 percent throughout the upper 30 inches of the solum. The average clay content of the control section ranges from 8 to 17 percent. Organic carbon exceeds 0.2 percent at a depth of 50 inches or there is an irregular decrease of organic carbon in the particle-size control section.\nThe A or Ap horizon has colors in hue of 1OYR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma 2 to 4; hue of 7.5YR, value 3 or 4, chroma 2 to 4, or hue of 5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is less than 7 inches thick when the moist color value is 3. Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has colors in hue of 1OYR, value of 3 to 6, chroma 3 to 8 or hue of 7.5YR, value 4 or 5, and chroma of 6. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, red or gray range from few to common. However, depth to redox depletions range from 24 to 48 inches, below the surface. Strata or pockets of loamy fine sand or sandy clay loam 1 to 3 centimeters thick make up less than 15 percent by volume. The weighted average texture is fine sandy loam or loam. However, layers with texture of loamy fine sand are common in the upper part.\nA buried A horizon is encountered in some pedons at a depth of 20 to 40 inches below the surface. Where present, it has color and texture similar to the A horizon.\nA Bg horizon is present in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches.  Where present, it has hue of 1OYR, value of 4 to 6, chroma 1 or 2. Redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow, or gray range from few to many. Texture is fine sandy loam, loam, or loamy fine sand with or without strata of these textures or sandy clay loam.\nThe BC or BCg horizon, if encountered, has colors mainly in shades of brown and gray. Some pedons contain few to common yellowish or reddish redox concentrations. The texture is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam or loam with or without strata of these textures or sandy clay loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The are no other series in the same family. The Dela, Iulus, Jena, Keechi, Ochlockonee and Thenas soils are in closely related families. Dela and Ocklockonee soils do not have a cambic horizon and have bedding planes in the control section. Jena soils do not have gray iron depletions in the solum and are well drained. Iulus soils have aquic conditions and redox depletions within 24 inches of the soil surface. Keechi soils have aquic conditions and dominant chroma of 2 within a depth 20 inches of the soil surface. Thenas soils have base saturation of more than 60 percent in some layer between 10 and 30 inches deep and also have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Owentown soils are on bottomlands and natural levees along streams. They are typically slightly higher than the nearby frequently flooded soils. Slope gradients are mainly less than 1 percent but range from 0 to 2 percent. The soil formed in loamy, acid unconsolidated alluvial sediments. The climate is warm and humid. The average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 48 inches, with frost-free rainfall of 25 to 30 inches. Frost free days range from 240 to 260. The elevation ranges from 150 to 250 feet above sea level. Mean annual temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F., and Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 64 to 84."

Bernaldo and Gallime soils are on slightly higher stream terraces and have an argillic horizon. Bowie and Oakwood soils are on nearby upland positions and have an argillic horizon that contains plinthite. Darco, Lilbert, Pickton, and Wolfpen soils are on nearby upland positions and have a thick, sandy epipedon. Keechi and Mantachie soils are on lower, wetter bottomlands than Owentown soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Owentown soils are moderately well drained with moderate permeability. Runoff is negligible on slopes less than 1 percent and low on slopes up to 2 percent. The layers below 30 to 48 inches deep are saturated for more than 30 cumulative days during December through April in normal years. These soils typically flood once every 3 to 20 years for very brief to brief periods."

The series was reclassified from a Fluventic Dystrudept to an Oxyaquic Dystrudept in 2002, and the series range was changed to allow gleyed colors below 40 inches deep.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the type location pedon include:\nOchric Epipedon - 0 to 4 inches (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - 4 to 80 inches (Bw and BC horizons)\nSaturation -  during normal years in all layers below 30 to 48 inches deep (Bw4 and BC horizons).\nIrregular Organic Carbon distribution - 4 to 50 inches (Bw horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
