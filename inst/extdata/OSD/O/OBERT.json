    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 102 centimeters (0 to 40 inches) (A1, A2 and AC horizons)\nAquic soil conditions: saturated from 40 and 50 centimeters (16 to 20 inches) for at least a few days when the soil temperature is above biological zero of 5 degrees C. (41 degrees F.)\nEndosaturation: saturated in all layers from the upper boundary of saturation to a depth of 200 centimeters (79 inches) or more from the mineral soil surface\nUpper boundary of saturation: less than 46 centimeters (18 inches) during late winter through early summer in most years and over the surface in some places\nIn prior surveys, the Obert soils were mapped and correlated as Lamo, wet.  The Lamo series is being divided into the Lamo (somewhat poorly drained) and Obert (poorly drained and very poorly drained) series.  They are in land Class IIw and Vw respectively.  About 6,000 hectares (15,000 acres) of Lamo, wet, have been correlated in Nebraska.  They will be mapped or recorrelated as Obert soils in the future.\nClassification changed from Haplaquolls to Endoaquolls according to changes in Taxonomy in 1992.\nModified format by LRM in 8/2006 to include metric conversion and change permeability to saturated hydraulic conductivity.\nIn Nebraska, the native vegetative cover is an herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with sedges (Carex emoryi, C. laeviconica, C. pellita, C. vulpinoidea), flat stem spikerush, (Eleocharis compressa), Kentucky bluegrass (Poa Pratensis), prairie cordgrass (Spartina pectinate).
