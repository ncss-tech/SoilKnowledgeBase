  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Oldtown series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils in depressions and on flood plains in coastal lowlands of the Gulf Coast Flatwoods.  They formed in sandy marine and alluvial sediments overlain by muck.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",

Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the Oa and A horizons and from strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the other horizons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 4 or less.  Percent fiber ranges from 5 to 15 percent rubbed and 20 to 75 percent unrubbed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, or yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.

Chaires and Leon soils have a spodic horizon, and additionally, Chaires and Meadowbrook soils have an argillic horizon at a depth of more than 40 inches.  Ortega and Ridgewood soils are on higher positions on the landscape and are better drained."
