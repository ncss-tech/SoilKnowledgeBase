Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the Oa and A horizons and from strongly acid to moderately alkaline in the other horizons.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 4 or less.  Percent fiber ranges from 5 to 15 percent rubbed and 20 to 75 percent unrubbed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, or yellow range from none to common.  Texture is sand or fine sand.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.

They formed in sandy marine and alluvial sediments overlain by thin accumulations of organic material.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 50 to 60 inches."

Chaires and Leon soils have a spodic horizon, and additionally, Chaires and Meadowbrook soils have an argillic horizon at a depth of more than 40 inches.  Ortega and Ridgewood soils are on higher positions on the landscape and are better drained."
