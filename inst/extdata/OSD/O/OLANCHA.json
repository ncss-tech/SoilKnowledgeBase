    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact range from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.  The soil between a depth of about 23 inches and the paralithic contact is moist in some part from November to mid-July and dry the rest of the year.  Soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F. from mid-April to mid-October.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 degrees to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 60 degrees to 63 degrees F.  Cobbles, stones, and gravel cover 50 to 60 percent of the soil surface.  Rock fragment content averages 30 to 80 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is modified by 30 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Color has not varied.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/6, 10YR 6/3 or 6/4, and moist color of 7.5YR 5/4, 10YR 4/3 or 5/4.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is modified by 60 to 90 percent rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Olancha soils are on mountain slopes and ridges.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  They have formed in material weathered from Pre-Cenozoic granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Elevations are 8,000 to 9,500 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches which occurs mostly as snowfall.  Mean annual temperature is 35 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 75 to 125 days."
