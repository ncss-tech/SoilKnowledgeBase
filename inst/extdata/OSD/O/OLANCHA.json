  "OVERVIEW": "The Olancha series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Olancha soils are on mountain slopes and ridges with slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 460 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is 4 degrees C.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact range from 50 to 100 centimeters.  The mollic epipedon is 25 to 41 centimeters thick.  The soil between a depth of about 59 centimeters and the paralithic contact is moist in some part from November to mid-July and dry the rest of the year.  Soil temperature is greater than 5 degrees C. from mid-April to mid-October.  The mean annual soil temperature is 4 degrees to 6 degrees C. The mean summer soil temperature is 15 degrees to 17 degrees C. Cobbles, stones, and gravel cover 50 to 60 percent of the soil surface.  Rock fragment volume averages 30 to 80 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is modified by 30 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Color has not varied.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/6, 10YR 6/3 or 6/4, and moist color of 7.5YR 5/4, 10YR 4/3 or 5/4.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is modified by 60 to 90 percent rock fragments."

They have formed in material weathered from Pre-Cenozoic granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Elevations are 2440 to 2900 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 380 to 460 millimeters which occurs mostly as snowfall. Mean annual soil temperature is 4 degrees to 6 degrees C., and the frost-free season is about 75 to 125 days."
