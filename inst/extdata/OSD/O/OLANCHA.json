  "OVERVIEW": "The Olancha series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from granitic and metamorphic rocks.  Olancha soils are on mountain slopes and ridges with slopes of 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F.",

The soil between a depth of about 23 inches and the paralithic contact is moist in some part from November to mid-July and dry the rest of the year.  Soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F. from mid-April to mid-October.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 degrees to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 60 degrees to 63 degrees F.  Cobbles, stones, and gravel cover 50 to 60 percent of the soil surface.  Rock fragment content averages 30 to 80 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is modified by 30 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Color has not varied.\nThe C horizon has dry color of 7.5YR 5/6, 10YR 6/3 or 6/4, and moist color of 7.5YR 5/4, 10YR 4/3 or 5/4.  It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand and is modified by 60 to 90 percent rock fragments."

Mean annual precipitation is 15 to 18 inches which occurs mostly as snowfall.  Mean annual temperature is 35 to 45 degrees F., and the frost-free season is about 75 to 125 days."
