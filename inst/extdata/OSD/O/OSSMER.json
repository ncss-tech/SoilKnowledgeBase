  "OVERVIEW": "The Ossmer series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils which are moderately deep to sandy outwash.  They formed mostly in loess or silty alluvium and in loamy alluvium underlain by stratified sandy outwash. Typically these soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, outwash terraces, glacial lake plains, glacial drainageways, and outwash areas of moraines. Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sandy outwash ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the silty mantle ranges from 12 to 40 inches. The coarse-loamy part of the particle size control section averages 8 to 17 percent clay and 15 to 50 percent fine sand or coarser. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 40 percent in the loamy subsoil.  Volume of gravel in the sandy outwash ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  A few stones are on the surface or in the solum in some areas. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum, but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum. Free carbonates are absent to depths of more than 5 feet. Redox accumulations are typically throughout the soil below the A horizon. Redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  Saturation occurs in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon at some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the A or AP horizon is silt loam.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silt.\nOssmer soils have a glossic horizon.  Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the extent to which eluviation has occurred.  Therefore, there can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination, with or without Bt or 2Bt horizons.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizons has color and texture like the E horizon described above.\nThe Bt part of the E/B or B/E horizons, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe 2E/B or 2B/E horizons contain less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser or are less than 5 inches thick.  The 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizons, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Bt part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizons, has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Bt horizon has color and texture like the 2Bt part described above.   Some pedons have a 2Btg horizon with dominant chroma of 2.  The 2B contains less than 50 percent fine sand or coarser or is less than 5 inches thick.\nSome pedons have a 3Bt, 3Btg, 3BC, or 3BCg horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 8 (value of 3 does not occur with chromas of 1, 2, or 3); Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, or coarse sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 3C horizon has color like the 3Bt horizon described above.  Texture is typically stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs, but some individual strata may be extremely gravelly. Some pedons have strata of loamy sand or loamy coarse sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs."
