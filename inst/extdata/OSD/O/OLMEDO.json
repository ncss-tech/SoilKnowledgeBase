  "REVDATE": "11/2010",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Olmedo series consists of soils that are very shallow and shallow over a petrocalcic horizon.  These well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous, loamy residuum of the Goliad Formation of Miocene-Pliocene age.  These nearly level to undulating soils are on summits on interfluves or ridges.  Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 711 mm (28 in).",
