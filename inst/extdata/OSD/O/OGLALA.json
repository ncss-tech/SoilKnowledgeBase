  "STATES": "NE,SD",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Oglala series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained or well drained soils formed in silty or loamy residuum weathered from soft fine grained sandstone.  These soils are on uplands.  They have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 40 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
