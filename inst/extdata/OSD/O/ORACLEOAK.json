  "OVERVIEW": "The Oracleoak series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium over residuum from granitoid sources.  The Oracleoak soils are on sideslopes and ridgetops of mountains.  Slopes range from 4-50%.  The mean annual precipitation is about 598 millimeters (24 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C. (50 degrees F.).",
