  "OVERVIEW": "The Oraid series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum from non-calcareous sedimentary rocks.  These soils are on ridgetops, mountain slopes, scarp slopes, and foothills.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 530 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 5.0 degrees C.",
