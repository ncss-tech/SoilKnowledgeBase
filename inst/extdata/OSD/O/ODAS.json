  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 60 inches or more deep.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from early April to early December (about 245 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F. from early mid May to mid November.  The soil moisture control section is always moist.  The water table is at the soil surface 1 to 2 weeks in the early spring months of March and April and fluctuates between 18 and 36 inches the rest of the year. Water table level depends upon the season and the occurrence of irrigation on these or adjacent soils.  The soils have an aquic moisture regime.  The potassium permanganate test indicates the soil moisture regime is a reducing regime free of dissolved oxygen.\nRedox concentrations are in the lower part of the A horizon and the C horizon.  They are few or common and fine, medium or large distinct dark 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6; 2.5Y 4/4, 5/4, 5/6 moist.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 5/2.  Moist colors are N2/0, N3/0; 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2.  It is sandy loam or loam with 5 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 3 to 15 percent and are mostly fine and medium rounded gravel.  It is moderately or strongly acid and the base saturation ranges from 35 to 60 percent, but is less than 50 percent in the upper 5 to 10 inches.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2.  The color in the lower part of the C horizon is commonly 1 unit higher in value or chroma both moist and dry than the A horizon.  It is sandy loam or loam with 5 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 3 to 25 percent.  Some pedons have strata of gravel or cobbles at depths of 45 inches or more."

The soils formed in alluvium and glacial outwash materials from extrusive igneous rocks and volcanic ash.  Elevations are 2,500 to 4,500 feet.  The climate is continental and subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 30 to 55 inches.  Seasonal snowfall is 60 to 100 inches.  Mean January temperature is 30 to 36 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 80 to 140 days."
