  "OVERVIEW": "The Odas series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium and glacial outwash from volcanic ejecta and extrusive igneous rock.  Odas soils are on small flood plains along streams. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is 60 inches or more deep.  The mean annual soil temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from early April to early December (about 245 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F. from early mid May to mid November.  The soil moisture control section is always moist.  The water table is at the soil surface 1 to 2 weeks in the early spring months of March and April and fluctuates between 18 and 36 inches the rest of the year. Water table level depends upon the season and the occurrence of irrigation on these or adjacent soils.  The soils have an aquic moisture regime.  The potassium permanganate test indicates the soil moisture regime is a reducing regime free of dissolved oxygen.\nRedox concentrations are in the lower part of the A horizon and the C horizon.  They are few or common and fine, medium or large distinct dark 10YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6; 2.5Y 4/4, 5/4, 5/6 moist.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 5/1, 5/2; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 5/2.  Moist colors are N2/0, N3/0; 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2; 2.5Y 3/2.  It is sandy loam or loam with 5 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 3 to 15 percent and are mostly fine and medium rounded gravel.  It is moderately or strongly acid and the base saturation ranges from 35 to 60 percent, but is less than 50 percent in the upper 5 to 10 inches.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3; 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2.  The color in the lower part of the C horizon is commonly 1 unit higher in value or chroma both moist and dry than the A horizon.  It is sandy loam or loam with 5 to 18 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 3 to 25 percent.  Some pedons have strata of gravel or cobbles at depths of 45 inches or more."
