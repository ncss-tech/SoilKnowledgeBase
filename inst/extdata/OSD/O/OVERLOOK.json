  "OVERVIEW": "The Overlook series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from granite.  Overlook soils are on fan terrace summits, shoulders, and side slopes.  Slopes range from 8 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
