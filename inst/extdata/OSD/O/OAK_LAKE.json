  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free calcium carbonate is typically 20 to 40 inches. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 16 to 30 inches.  The thickness of the silty mantle is typically 30 to 50 inches.  The control section contains about 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. The AB horizon consists mostly of worm casts and filled worm holes. The mollic epipedon, below the Ap horizon, has at least 50 percent by volume of worm casts, worm holes and worm filled holes and the transition to the underlying material has at least 25 percent worm casts, worm holes and worm filled holes.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1. The A horizon is silty clay loam, or silt loam and is neutral or slightly acid.  The AB horizon has colors and textures of the A and Bw horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has  hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 , and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay loam or silt loam, and is neutral or slightly alkaline.  In some places a sandy loam transitional layer is between the Bw and 2Bk horizons.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam.  It has few or common, fine or medium accumulations of carbonate.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or clay loam. It has few or common, faint to prominent mottles. The 2Bk and 2C horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

The Oak Lake soils formed in loamy glacial till which is overlain by a mantle of silty material. Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 23 inches.  Annual frost free days are 120 to 140.  Elevation ranges from 890 to 1950 feet."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Parnell, Singsaas and Winger soils.  Parnell soils contain more than 35 percent clay in the particle size conrol section, have soil saturation to the surface and are in depressions.  Singsaas soils formed in a thinner silt mantle and are on higher parts of the landscape. Winger soils are calcareous, have a  wetter soil moisture control section and are in drainageways, rims of depressions and lower lying flats."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 29 inches (Ap, A and AB horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from about 29 to 69 inches (Bw and Bk horizons).  Calcic horizon - the zone from about 43 to 69 inches (2Bk horizon).\nThe Oak Lake series was originally established for this same concept but was later combined with Singsaas and made inactive in January, 1978.  With the correlation of Lincoln County, Minnesota, the Oak Lake series was once again recognized as different then the Singsaas series by being down drainage.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
