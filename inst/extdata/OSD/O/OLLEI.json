  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The solum is 8 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2, or 3/3.  It has an apparent field texture of silt loam or gravelly silt loam.  By volume, the A horizon is 5 to 25 percent hard basalt and indurated tuff fragments, .2 to 2 inches in size and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction in 1:1 water is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe B horizon has moist color of 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, or 4/6 or of 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, or 4/6.  It has an apparent field texture of loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and is very gravelly.  Clay content, as calculated by the product of 2.5 times the 15-bar water percentage, is more than about 70 percent.  By volume, the B horizon is 35 to 60 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, or 5/2 or of 5Y 5/1.  The apparent field texture is extremely flaggy loam or extremely flaggy silt loam.  Exfoliated and partially weathered, hard, tuffacious flagstones range from .4 to 1 inch thick by 3 to 8 inches thick across.  Pedons overlying breccia contains pebbles and cobbles ranging from 1 to 6 inches in size.  Coarse fragments range from 70 to 90 percent by volume."
