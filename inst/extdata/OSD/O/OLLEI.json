  "OVERVIEW": "The Ollei series consists of shallow, well drained soils on coastal benches, hill, and ridgetops.  These soils formed in residuum derived from andesitic and basaltic breccia and tuff.  Slope is 12 to 75 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 145 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 81 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The solum is 8 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has moist color of 10YR 2/2, 3/2, or 3/3.  It has an apparent field texture of silt loam or gravelly silt loam.  By volume, the A horizon is 5 to 25 percent hard basalt and indurated tuff fragments, .2 to 2 inches in size and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction in 1:1 water is strongly acid or medium acid.\nThe B horizon has moist color of 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, or 4/6 or of 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, or 4/6.  It has an apparent field texture of loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and is very gravelly.  Clay content, as calculated by the product of 2.5 times the 15-bar water percentage, is more than about 70 percent.  By volume, the B horizon is 35 to 60 percent pebbles and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe C horizon has moist color of 10YR 4/3, 4/4, or 5/2 or of 5Y 5/1.  The apparent field texture is extremely flaggy loam or extremely flaggy silt loam.  Exfoliated and partially weathered, hard, tuffacious flagstones range from .4 to 1 inch thick by 3 to 8 inches thick across.  Pedons overlying breccia contains pebbles and cobbles ranging from 1 to 6 inches in size.  Coarse fragments range from 70 to 90 percent by volume."
