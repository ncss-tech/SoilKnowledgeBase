Olequa soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days. Average annual soil temperature at depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The argillic horizon ranges from 20 to 35 percent clay and is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist or dry.  It has moderate to strong granular structure.  This horizon is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe BA and Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.  This horizon has strong or moderate subangular blocky to prismatic or angular structure. It is moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe BCt horizon, when present, has value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Olequa soils occur at elevations of 40 to 300 feet and are on nearly level to moderately steep high terraces and on steep hillsides and terrace escarpments.  These soils formed in old alluvium.  They are in a humid marine climate with 40 to 60 inches annual precipitation occurring mostly as rain during the winter.  The mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 64 degrees F; and the mean temperature is 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is 150 to 200 days.  The growing season (28F) is 175 to 240 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Klaber, Newberg, Prather, Reed, Salkum, and Winston soils.  Klaber and Reed soils have an aquic moisture regime.  Newberg soils have a mollic epipedon and an irregular decrease in organic carbon.  Prather soils are in a fine family and are moderately well drained.  Salkum soils are in a clayey family.  Winston soils have a spodic horizon and are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The classification is based on laboratory data on the associated Centralia soils (Lab number S84WA-15-005).  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an umbric epipedon from the mineral surface to 10 inches and an argillic horizon from 20 to 65 inches.  The base saturation (by sum) is assumed to be less than 35 percent throughout the argillic horizon.  These soils were previously classified fine-silty, mixed, mesic Xeric Haplohumults.  Classification change based on National Soil Taxonomy Handbook, Issue No. 12, re- establishing Palehumults.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
