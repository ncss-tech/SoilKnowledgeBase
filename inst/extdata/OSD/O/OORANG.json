  "OVERVIEW": "The Oorang series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on mountain summits and basins. Slopes are 4 to 35 percent. These soils formed in residuum derived from limestone. Oorang soils have moderate permeability. Mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 30 degrees F.",
