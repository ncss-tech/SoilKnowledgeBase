The soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 70 consecutive days during the 4 month period following the summer solstice. Depth to the lithic contact is 4 to 10 inches. Rock fragments average 35 to 75 percent in the solum. The solum has more than 40 percent by weight of serpentine or ultramafic minerals.  Hue is dominantly 10YR or 7.5YR, but may range to 5YR at higher elevations.\nThe A horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1, 2, or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam with 10 to 18 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Overholt soils are on ridge tops and shoulders of hills and mountains. They are also on side slopes of hills and mountains adjacent to exposed serpentine or ultramafic bedrock.  The elevation dominantly ranges from 4,000 to 6,600 feet, but may range down to 3,400 feet on steep north slopes. Slopes range from 7 to 40 percent. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered mainly from serpentine or ultramafic rocks. This soil is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches. The average mean temperature ranges from 41 to 45 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is about 30 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 65 degrees F. The frost free season is about 50 to 70 days."
