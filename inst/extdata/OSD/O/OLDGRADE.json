    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oldgrade soils are on mountains and plateaus.  They typically occur on toeslope positions.  They formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.   Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 2,200 to 2,850 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 450 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
