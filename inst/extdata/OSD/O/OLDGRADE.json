  "OVERVIEW": "The Oldgrade series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Oldgrade soils are on mountains and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
