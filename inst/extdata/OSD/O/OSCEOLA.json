  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Osceola soils are on slightly dissected bedrock controlled hills on uplands.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 5 percent.   Osceola soils formed in 51 to 114 cm (20 to 45 inches) of loess, a thin layer of outwash, and in residuum weathered from shale or siltstone.  Climate is midcontinental with hot summers and cold winters.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10.0 to 12.2 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1016 mm (36 to 40 inches).  Frost free days ranges from 160 to 180.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1020 feet)."

Drummer and Elburn soils formed in loess and outwash and are on outwash plains slightly lower on the landscape.  Marseilles and Massbach soils are moderately deep and are on side slopes below the Osceola soils."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the loess moderately high to high (4.23 to 42.34 micrometers per second) in the outwash and moderately low to moderately high (0.42 to 1.41 micrometers per second) in the residuum. Permeability is moderately slow in the loess, moderate to moderately rapid in the outwash and slow in the residuum.  Depth to seasonal zone of saturation is as high as 31 to 91 cm (1 to 3 feet) at some time from March to June in most years."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Classification was adjusted to agree with ST Issue #17 on 23 Aug 94 by CLG.  The Osceola series was reactivated on 11/93. The previous type location was in Stark County, Illinois.  This revision moves the type location back to Stark County.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 38 cm (0 to 15 inches0 (Ap and E horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from 38 to 132 cm (15 to 52 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, 2Btg3, 2Btg4, 3Btg5 horizons);  paralithic contact at 132 cm (52 inches);  aquic conditions - continuous saturation in all layers between a depth of about 46 cm (18 inches) and 203 cm (80 inches) in spring of most years.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to NSSL Nos. 91P1060 - 91P1066.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
