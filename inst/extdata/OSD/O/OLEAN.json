  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to sandy or gravelly deposits range from 20 to 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments are absent or less than 5 percent by volume in the surface layer and subsoil, and range from 0 to 70 percent in the substratum. Rock fragments are dominantly gravel or cobbles. Reaction, unless limed, ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum, and from very strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. The A horizon ranges from 2 to 5 inches thick.\nThe BE or E horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 though 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bt horizon has colors similar to the BE horizon. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, prismatic or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or firm.\nSome pedons may have a BC horizon with colors and structures similar to those of the B and C horizons, and textures of silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy sand or sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is loose loamy sand or sand in the fine-earth fraction."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Olean series is the only series in its family.\nThe Allard, Collamer, Scio, Swormville, and Unadilla Series are similar soils in related families. Allard soils have a coarse-silty over sandy or sandy skeletal particle-size control section. Collamer soils have a fine-silty particle-size control section. Scio and Unadilla soils have coarse-silty particle-size control sections. Swormville soils have an aquic moisture regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Olean soils are nearly level to sloping soils on outwash terraces, alluvial fans and high bottom stream terraces in glaciated areas. The solum formed in old alluvium or eolian deposits that form a silty mantle over sand and gravel glacio-fluvial or deltaic deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches; mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F., and the frost free season ranges from 110 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 400 to 1800 feet above sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Olean series is the moderately well drained member of a drainage sequence that includes the well drained Allard soils, somewhat poorly drained Swormville soils, and poorly and very poorly drained Getzville soils. The Chenango, Castile, Middlebury, Tioga, and Valois soils are on associated landscapes. Chenango and Castile soils lack a silty mantle and are gravelly throughout. Tioga and Middlebury soils are on adjacent lower flood plains. Valois soils are in till deposits on nearby valley sides."
