  "OVERVIEW": "The Oxvalley series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff and minor amounts of quartzite. Oxvalley soils are on northern backslopes of mountains. Slopes range from 15 to 45 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 450 mm and the mean annual air temperature is 4 degrees C.",
