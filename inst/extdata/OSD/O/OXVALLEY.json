Oxvalley soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from welded tuff with high silica content and minor amounts of quartzite. Elevation ranges from 2,380 to 2,750 meters. The climate is dry sub-humid with cool moist winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 500 mm and the mean annual air temperature ranges from 3 to 6 degrees C. The frost-free period ranges from 40 to 70 days."
