  "OVERVIEW": "Okan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Okan soils are on inset fans, fan skirts, and barrier beaches.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
