  "OVERVIEW": "The Ormiston series consists of deep to sandstone, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from eolian material, and colluvium and residuum from sandstone.  Ormiston soils are on hills and mesas.  Slopes range from 0 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",
