  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to horizons with secondary carbonates ranges from 30 to 50 inches. Depth to chalk bedrock characterized as a paralithic contact is more than 60 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is commonly clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or silty clay, but ranges to loam, fine sandy loam, or silt loam. Reaction is commonly very strongly acid or strongly acid, but ranges to neutral where lime has been added.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 6 to 8. Texture is clay. Iron depletions in shades of gray and iron accumulations in shades of brown and red range from none to common, generally increasing with depth. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid. Some pedons have faint, slightly grooved slickensides and are designated Btss.\nThe upper part of the Bss horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; or has no dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of red, brown, and gray. The lower part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6; or has no dominant matrix color and is multi-colored in shades of brown, gray, and red. Iron depletions in shades of gray and iron accumulations in shades of brown and red range from few to many, generally increasing with depth. Texture is clay. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bkss horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, and value of 4 to 6. Chroma ranges from 4 to 8 in ped interiors and from 2 to 4 on exterior faces of peds or slickenside faces. Some pedons do not have a dominant matrix color and are multicolored in shades of olive, brown, and gray. Iron depletions in shades of gray and iron accumulations in shades of brown range from few to many and are most common on surfaces of peds or slickensides. Texture is clay or silty clay. Reaction is commonly slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline, but ranges to neutral. Soft masses of calcium carbonate range from common to many and concretions or nodules of carbonate range from few to many. Some pedons have few to common soft masses and/or concretions of manganese.\nThe 2C horizon, present in some pedons, is highly weathered chalk or calcareous clay. It is massive or has platy rock structure. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a 2Cr horizon below a depth of 60 inches that is weathered chalk bedrock. It can be dug with difficulty with hand tools and is rippable by light machinery."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Lacerda, Redco, Suggsville, and Wilcox series in the same family and the Hannon and Raylake series in related families. The Hannon series is less acid in the upper 20 inches, is in a fine particle-size family, and has carbonates within 30 inches of the surface. Lacerda soils do not have an argillic horizon and are derived from shale. Raylake soils are in a fine particle-size family and have gypsum crystals in the lower part of the solum. Redco soils do not have an argillic horizon and have hue of 10YR or yellower throughout the subsoil. Suggsville soils are well drained and have a paralithic contact of limestone or chalk within a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Wilcox soils are somewhat poorly drained and have a paralithic contact of acid shale within a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oktibbeha soils are on ridges and side slopes on uplands of the Alabama and Mississippi Blackland Prairie (MLRA 135A) and the Southern Coastal Plain (MLRA 133A and 133B) MLRA's. Slopes are generally 1 to 15 percent, but may be as steep as 30 percent in some places. These soils formed in clayey sediments overlying chalk or calcareous clays. The average annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 56 inches."

Binnsville and Demopolis soils are on higher positions and are shallow to bedrock. Faunsdale and Maytag soils are on lower positions and have hue of 10YR or yellower throughout. Keiffer and Sumter soils are on similar positions as Oktibbeha soils and are fine-silty and calcareous to the surface. Kipling soils, on lower positions, are in the fine particle-size family and have dominant hue of 7.5YR or yellower in the upper part of the solum. Vaiden soils, on lower, less convex positions, have dominant hue of 10YR or yellower in the upper part of the solum. Watsonia soils are on similar positions as Oktibbeha soils and are shallow to chalk bedrock."

No free water has been observed in these soils but soil morphology suggests that they may be saturated within a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet of the surface for short periods during winter and spring."

An argillic horizon is not currently recognized in the Vertisol order but is considered an important feature of this soil.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of about 4 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from about 4 to 13 inches (Bt horizons)\nCambic horizon - the zone from about 13 to 80 inches (Bss and Bkss horizons)\nVertic features - intersecting slickensides beginning at about 13 inches and continuing to a depth of 80 inches.
