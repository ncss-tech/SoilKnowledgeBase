  "OVERVIEW": "The Orwash series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed from mixed alluvium derived from granitic sources. Orwash soils are on fan aprons, fan skirts, and alluvial flats. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and mean annual temperature is about 59 degrees F.",

Amole soils lack a subhorizon with more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section, are noncalcareous in the upper part of the control section and have soil temperatures of 66 to 72 degrees F. Challenger soils have loamy texures and SARs of 30 to 100 at depths starting below 30 to 40 inches. Hypoint soils have soil temperatures of 64 to 71 degrees F. and are not dominated by fine gravel. Livefire soils have soil temperatures of 63 to 71 degrees F. and are not dominated by fine gravel. Redington soils contain densic (Cd) horizons. Shortbread soils have 0 to 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Yellowrock soils do not have 10 to 20 days summer precipitation, not dominated by fine gravel, and have soil temperature of 66 to 70 degrees F."
