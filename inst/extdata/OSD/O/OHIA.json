  "OVERVIEW": "The Ohia series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash which overlies pahoehoe or `a`a lava on the lower windward slopes of Mauna Loa Volcano.  Slopes range from 3 to 10 percent. The mean annual rainfall is about 4,064 millimeters (160 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 19 degrees C (66 degrees F).",

The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over either `a`a or pahoehoe lava.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 3,500 to 4,500 millimeters (137 to 177 inches), and cloud cover is common.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1,016 to 1,270 millimeters (40 to 50 inches).  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 16 to 22 degrees C (61 to 72 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
