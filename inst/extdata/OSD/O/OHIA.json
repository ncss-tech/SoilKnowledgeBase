    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Ohia soils are on the lower windward slopes of Mauna Loa Volcano at elevations of 366 to 914 meters (1,200 to 3,000 feet).  The soils are located on both `a`a and pahoehoe lava flows 5,000 to over 10,000 years old.  Slopes range from 3 to 10 percent.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over either `a`a or pahoehoe lava.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 3,500 to 4,500 millimeters (137 to 177 inches), and cloud cover is common.  The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1,016 to 1,270 millimeters (40 to 50 inches).  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 16 to 22 degrees C (61 to 72 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
