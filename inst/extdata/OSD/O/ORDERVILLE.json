  "OVERVIEW": "The Orderville series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and shale.  Orderville soils are on structural benches and hillslopes.  Slopes range from 15 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches (406 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F (8.3 degrees C).",

The Flugle soils are on stable and slightly less sloping portions of structural benches and have an argillic horizon.  The Naplene soils are in swales on structural benches and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons. The Sideshow soils occur on structural benches capped by fine textured alluvium and residuum from shale and are smectitic. These soils also have gypsum masses in the lower horizons."
