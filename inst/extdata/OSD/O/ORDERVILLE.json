The soils formed in residuum and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges is 14 to 17 inches (355 to 432 mm) and mean annual air temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F (7.2 to 10 degrees C). Frost-free period is 100 to 119 days. April, May, and June are driest months, with monsoonal pattern rainfall in late summer and light to moderate rainfall and snowfall in winter."

The Flugle soils are on stable and slightly less sloping portions of structural benches and have an argillic horizon.  The Naplene soils are in swales on structural benches and do not have diagnostic subsurface horizons. The Sideshow soils occur on structural benches capped by fine textured alluvium and residuum from shale and are smectitic. These soils also have gypsum masses in the lower horizons."
