  "OVERVIEW": "The Oak Glen series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly granitic rocks.  Oak Glen soils are on alluvial fans and toe slopes.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 55 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 54 to 59 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 47 degrees F. all the time or is above 47 degrees F. after the middle of February (95 to 120 days) in some soils.  Soil between depths of about 8 and 24 inches usually is continuously dry in all parts from late May or early June until late November or early December, and usually is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Rock fragments, in all parts, are less than 35 percent and usually consist of less than 20 percent mineral grains 2 to 5 mm in diameter.  Texture throughout the profile is relatively uniform and is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  The soil profine is neutral to moderately acid but is usually slightly acid or near slightly acid.  Base saturation is 75 to 95 percent.  Organic matter decreases regularly with depth and is more than 1 percent to a depth of 20 to 30 inches or more.\nThe A horizon is brown, gray, grayish brown, dark grayish brown, dark gray or dark brown (10YR 5/3, 5/1, 5/2 4/2, 4/1 4/3).  Moist colors are very dark brown, very dark grayish brown, dark brown or very dark gray (10YR 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/1).  This horizon has weak or moderate granular or subangular blocky structure.  It contains 1.5 to 4 percent organic matter.\nThe C horizon is dark grayish brown, grayish brown, dark brown, brown yellowish brown, light yellowish brown or reddish brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 3/3, 5/3, 5/4, 6/4; 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/4; 5YR 4/3, 4/4). It has weak granular or subangular blocky structure or is massive, and it is soft or slightly hard."

Edmundston soils have a B horizon, have rock fragments that range from 2 to 10 mm and have a mean summer and winter difference of about 41 degrees F.  Imbler soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 47 to 53 degrees F.  Ritter soils are dominantly loam in the 10 to 40 inch control section, have a B horizon and are mildly alkaline in the lower part of the B horizon.  Stevens soils are calcareous below a depth of 25 to 40 inches and are loam or silt loam in the particle size control section.  Uhlig soils have a loam B horizon with the upper part containing a high component of loess and ash."

The soils formed in alluvium from a variety of rock but dominantly from granitic rock sources.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters with some snow.  The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.; the mean annual January temperature is about 42 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F.  The frost free season is 150 to 225 days."

Crafton soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of less than 20 inches.  Crouch soils have base saturation of less than 75 percent and have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick.  Mottsville soils are sandy in the control section."
