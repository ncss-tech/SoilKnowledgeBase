  "OVERVIEW": "The Owhi series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in glacial outwash with a component of loess and volcanic ash in the upper part.  These soils are on outwash terraces and terrace escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 12 and 35 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Solum thickness is 12 to 26 inches with some part having base saturation of less than 75 percent.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles and stones.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.  It has 10 to 30 percent glass and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.15 to 0.40 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry , 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and is gravelly in some pedons.  It is 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe CB horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam or loamy sand with 5 to 12 percent clay and is very gravelly.  It is 35 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  This horizon is absent in some pedons.\nThe C horizon is commonly multicolored, but can have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is loamy sand, sand or coarse sand with 0 to 5 percent clay and is very gravelly or extremely gravelly.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."
