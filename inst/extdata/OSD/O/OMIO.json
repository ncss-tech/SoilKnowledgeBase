The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches thick and includes all or part of the Bw horizon in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 3 to 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 or 2 or 3 moist.  It is silt loam and averages 20 to 25 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 5 to 7 and 4 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam.  The underlying beds are soft to slightly hard siltstone, sandstone or silty shale."

Amsterdam soils contain substantial amounts of volcanic glass shards and are in intermountain valleys.  Bryant, Golva, and Temvik soils do not have siltstone, shale or sandstone within depths of 40 inches.  Peritsa and Sen soils are formed in place from shale siltstone and do not have the loess mantle.  Chama soils have carbonates at depths less than 10 inches."

Amor, Reeder and Vebar soils are on nearby landscapes where the bedrock contains more sand and the loess mantle is absent.  Grassna soils are on concave landscape positions and do not have the soft siltstone, shale or sandstone bedrock within 40 inches of the surface."
