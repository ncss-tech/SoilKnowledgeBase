  "OVERVIEW": "The Overland series are moderately deep well drained soils that formed residuum derived from limestone with some ashy loess influence. Overland soils are on mountains. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
