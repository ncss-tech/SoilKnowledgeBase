  "OVERVIEW": "The Oleo series consists of very deep, well drained soils on volcanic plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in local alluvium from tephra and loess.  Oleo soils have moderately rapid permeability.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
