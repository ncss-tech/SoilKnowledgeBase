Apalona, Bedford, Nicholson, and Weisburg soils have some horizon below the fragipan that averages more than 34 percent clay. Ava, Cincinnati, and Zanesville soils do not have stratification below the fragipan. Fountainville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Grantsburg and Hosmer soils have more than 102 cm (40 inches) of loess. Hildebrecht soils have more than 3 percent rock fragment in the fragipan. Omulga and Lawrenceville soils have rock fragments that are not of glacial origin. Otwood soils compete very closely, but are on stream and river terraces. Solsberry soils average more than 3 percent rock fragments of sandstone channers in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Otwell soils are on loess covered lake plains. Slope gradient is typically 2 to 18 percent, and ranges from 0 to 50 percent. The soils formed in 50 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess and the underlying lacustrine or glaciofluvial sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1168 mm (38 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 200 days. Elevation is 107 to 305 meters (350 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

They both are on treads of stream terraces. Dubois soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on nearly level flats and gently sloping shoulder slopes of lake plains. Haubstadt soils are moderately well drained and are on nearly level to moderately sloping summits and shoulder slopes of lake plains. Peoga soils are poorly drained and are on treads of stream terraces or flats of lake plains."

The depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 46 to 91 cm (1.5 to 3.0 feet) between January and April in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff ranges from medium to very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the fragipan and low to moderately high in and below the fragipan. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow in and below the fragipan. A few areas are subject to flooding."

This type location is more representative of the landform for this series. Further investigation is needed to determine if this site represents the dominant soil properties for this series.\nFlooded phases and severely eroded phases are recognized.\nDiagnostic horizons and features - recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface of the soil to a depth of 18 cm (7 inches), (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from 18 to 203 cm (7 to 93 inches), (Bt1, Bt2, 2Btx1, 2Btx2, 2Bt1, 2Bt2 horizons).\nFragipan: from 58 to 132 cm (23 to 52 inches), (2Btx1, 2Btx2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data is available for this soil from Purdue Soil Characterization Laboratory Soil No. S76IN37-7.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
