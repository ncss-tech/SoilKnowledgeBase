  "OVERVIEW": "The Otley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on interfluves and side slopes on dissected till plains and on treads and risers on loess covered stream terraces. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 935 millimeters (36.8 inches).",
