  "OVERVIEW": "The Orcap series consists of moderately deep well drained moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone and limestone.  Orcap soils occur on mountainsides and have slopes of 15 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

Calcium carbonate equivalent averages 40 to 60 percent, including the carbonates in the coarse fragments of less than 20 millimeters size, between 10 inches and the paralithic contact.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam, with 20 to 60 percent rock fragments that are predominantly gravel and cobbles.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is gravelly loam, loam or gravelly clay loam with 5 to 35 percent rock fragments that are predominantly gravel and cobbles.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
