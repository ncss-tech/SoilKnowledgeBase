Calcium carbonate equivalent averages 40 to 60 percent, including the carbonates in the coarse fragments of less than 20 millimeters size, between 10 inches and the paralithic contact.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam, with 20 to 60 percent rock fragments that are predominantly gravel and cobbles.
