  "OVERVIEW": "The Outland series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from andesite or pyroclastic rock.  Outland soils are on plateaus and mountain back slopes.  Slope ranges from 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
