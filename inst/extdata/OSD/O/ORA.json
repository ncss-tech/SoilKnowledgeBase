Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4, or it is neutral with value of 4 and chroma of 0. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have a thin BE horizon. Where present, it has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8. Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam, or loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; or there is no dominant color and is variegated and multicolored in shades of yellow, brown, gray, and red. Vertical seams in shades of gray form a roughly polygonal pattern of prisms. The matrix of the prisms is very firm when dry and brittle when moist in the major part of the fragipan and constitutes more than 60 percent of the volume. Concretions in shades of black and brown range from none to many. Texture is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam. Some pedons have few fine to coarse quartz pebbles.\nThe BC and C horizon, where present, has the same range of colors as the Btx horizon. Texture is sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam."

The poorly drained Mashulaville soils are in adjacent lower flats and depressions and have coarse-loamy control sections. The somewhat poorly drained Pheba soils are on similar to lower positions and have coarse-silty control sections. Paden and Prentiss soils are moderately well drained and are on broad flats in uplands and on terraces along major streams. Paden soils are on similar positions, have fine-silty control sections and have yellower subsoils. Prentiss soils are on similar positions, have coarse-loamy control sections and have yellower subsoils. The well drained Ruston soils are in similar positions but do not have a fragipan. The well drained Smithdale soils are on adjacent hill sides and do not have fragipans."
