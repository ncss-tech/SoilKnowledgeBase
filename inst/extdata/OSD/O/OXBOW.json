    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C. (51 to 56 degrees F.).  Depth to the indurated duripan is 50 to 100 centimeters (20 to 40 inches).  Up to 3 percent of surface is covered with rock fragments, dominantly stones.  Depth to bedrock is over 152 centimeters (60 inches).\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 5 to about 20 percent, of which 5 to 20 percent are cobbles and stones and 0 to 15 percent is gravel.  Rock fragments are rounded.\nThe Bt2 and Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay and has 50 to 60 percent clay.  It has moderate or strong prismatic and blocky structure.  The Btk horizon is slightly to strongly effervescent.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 30 percent and consist of cobbles, stones and gravel.  Rock fragments are rounded.\nThe duripan (2Bkqm horizon) is 15 to 50 centimeters (6 to 20 inches) thick.  It has 30 to 80 percent gravel and cobbles.  Stratified sandy, gravelly, and strongly cemented layers underlay the duripan.  Rock fragments are rounded."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Hibbard, Notchcorral, and Salisbury series.  Hibbard soils are similar and occur in MLRA 10 which is characterized by having big sagebrush.  The climate is different in terms of timing and distribution of precipitation even though the total is the same.  Hibbard and Notchcorral soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.).  Notchcorral soils have bedrock below the duripan.  Salisbury soils lack carbonate accumulation in the lower part of the argillic horizon and duripan."

The soils formed in mixed alluvial sediments. Mean annual precipitation is 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches).  Mean annual temperature is about 8 to 10 degrees C. (47 to 50 degrees F.).  The average frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."

The Belshaw soils are on side slopes of hills, are very deep, and formed from volcanic tuff. Prill soils are on benches and side slopes of hills and are moderately deep to volcanic tuff.  Starkey soils are on benches and side slopes of hills and are shallow to volcanic tuff.  Oxwall soils are 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) deep to a duripan and are formed on old alluvial fans.  Tub soils are on hillsides and are deep over volcanic tuff.  The Zweygardt soils are on old fan terrace side slopes, are clayey-skeletal, and very deep."
