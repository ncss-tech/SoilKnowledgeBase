  "OVERVIEW": "The Oxbow series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium.  Oxbow soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C. (48 degrees F.).",

Up to 3 percent of surface is covered with rock fragments, dominantly stones.  Depth to bedrock is over 152 centimeters (60 inches).\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam or loam with 25 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments range from 5 to about 20 percent, of which 5 to 20 percent are cobbles and stones and 0 to 15 percent is gravel.  Rock fragments are rounded.\nThe Bt2 and Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay and has 50 to 60 percent clay.  It has moderate or strong prismatic and blocky structure.  The Btk horizon is slightly to strongly effervescent.  Rock fragments range from 10 to 30 percent and consist of cobbles, stones and gravel.  Rock fragments are rounded.\nThe duripan (2Bkqm horizon) is 15 to 50 centimeters (6 to 20 inches) thick.  It has 30 to 80 percent gravel and cobbles.  Stratified sandy, gravelly, and strongly cemented layers underlay the duripan.  Rock fragments are rounded."

The climate is different in terms of timing and distribution of precipitation even though the total is the same.  Hibbard and Notchcorral soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 11 degrees C. (51 degrees F.).  Notchcorral soils have bedrock below the duripan.  Salisbury soils lack carbonate accumulation in the lower part of the argillic horizon and duripan."

The Belshaw soils are on side slopes of hills, are very deep, and formed from volcanic tuff. Prill soils are on benches and side slopes of hills and are moderately deep to volcanic tuff.  Starkey soils are on benches and side slopes of hills and are shallow to volcanic tuff.  Oxwall soils are 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) deep to a duripan and are formed on old alluvial fans.  Tub soils are on hillsides and are deep over volcanic tuff.  The Zweygardt soils are on old fan terrace side slopes, are clayey-skeletal, and very deep."
