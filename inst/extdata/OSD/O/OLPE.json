    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Olpe soils are on high terraces or uplands.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in old gravelly and clayey alluvium with some modification of the surface with deposition of loess, over residuum from limestone and shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 1090 mm (32 to 43 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 17 degrees C (57 to 62 degrees F).  Elevation is 270 to 430 meters (880 to 1410 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaites Annual P-E Index ranges from 60 to 72."

Eram soils are on similar topography as Olpe soils but they formed in residuum weathered from shale.  Dennis, Eram, and Summit soils are on areas below Olpe soils.  Kenoma, and Lula soils are on smoother areas adjacent to and slightly below Olpe soils.  All these associated soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments by volume in their control section."
