  "OVERVIEW": "The Olpe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in old gravelly sediments over residuum from limestone and shale.  These soils are on uplands or high terraces.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 1090 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).",

Kenoma, and Lula soils are on smoother areas adjacent to and slightly below Olpe soils.  All these associated soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments by volume in their control section."
