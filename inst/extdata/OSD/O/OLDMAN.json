  "OVERVIEW": "The Oldman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy deposits on ground moraines and end moraines.  Permeability is moderately rapid in the upper part, very slow in the fragipan, and moderately slow in the material below the fragipan. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches and mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
