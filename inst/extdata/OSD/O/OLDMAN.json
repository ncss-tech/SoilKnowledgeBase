    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 35 to greater than 60 inches.  Depth to the fragipan is 16 to 30 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the solum.  Gravel content ranges from 5 to 20 percent in the surface horizons and from 15 to 40 percent in lower part of the profile.  Cobble and stone content ranges from 10 to 40 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A and E horizons are cobbly, stony, very cobbly or very stony analogs of fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bhs horizons have value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.  The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6.  Textures are very gravelly or very cobbly analogs of fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or silt loam.\nThe B part of the (B/E)x horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, and value of 4 to 6.  The E part has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Textures are very gravelly or very cobbly analogs of fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  The (E/B)x horizon has similar colors and textures to the (B/E)x horizons.\nThe E part of the E/B horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B part has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value of 4 or 5.
