  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "JLL/GRB",
  "REVDATE": "02/2008",
  "STATES": "PR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Olivares series consists of very deep, very poorly drained, slowly permeable soils in large depressional areas of the Semiarid Coastal Plain.  They formed in loamy and clayey alluvial and marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual air temperature is about 84 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 80 inches.  Content of pebbles is less than 2 percent, by volume.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the Oa and A horizons, and moderately alkaline in the C horizons.\nThe Oa horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is mucky peat or muck.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10 YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 2.5 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown and yellow range from few to many.  In the upper part of some pedons, there is no dominant color and the matrix is multi-colored in shades of gray, brown, and yellow.  Texture is silty clay or clay."
