  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 50 to 100 cm [20 to 40 in]. Content of rock fragments ranges from 15 to 60 percent in surface horizons and from 25 to 70 percent in the subsoil, and 25 to 85 percent in the substratum. Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid throughout the soil.\nSome pedons have a thin O horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue ranging from 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 2.5 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Dry color value is 6 or more. It is channery or very channery, and the fine earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam. It has granular or subangular blocky structure, and very friable or friable consistence. Some pedons have an E horizon at a depth of less than 13 cm [5 in].\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. The fine earth fraction is typically silt loam or loam but the range includes fine sandy loam in some places. It has weak or very weak granular or subangular blocky structure and very friable to firm consistence.\nThe BC horizon has properties similar to the B and C horizons.\nThe C or 2C horizon, when present, have hue of 10R to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is typically sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction but the range includes fine sandy loam in some places. It is massive, with or without plate-like divisions."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oquaga soils are in uplands and formed in a thin mantle of reddish till with lithology dominated by the local and underlying reddish sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Slope ranges from 0 to 70 percent. The climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation typically ranges from 795 to 1725 mm (31 to 68 in), but in some higher elevations it can range as high as 1790 mm (70 in). Mean annual temperature typically ranges from 6 to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F), but in some higher elevations it can range as low as 4 degrees C (39 degrees F). Mean annual frost-free days ranges from 105 to 180 days. These soils generally occur at elevations between 100 to 670 m (328 to 2,198 ft), but have been mapped as high as 750 m (2,460 ft) in some places."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {

Most of the acreage lies within MLRA 140, the Glaciated Allegheny Plateau and Catskill Mountains, but some delineations of Oquaga soils fall outside the MLRA 140 boundary, in transitional zones with MLRA 127, MLRA 101, and MLRA 144A."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: A new pedon was selected in 1998. The Allegany Co., NY pedon no longer fit the series concept and most of Allegany County uplands are considered to be in the frigid temperature regime. This series was used in MLRA 127. The use of a series with glacial parent material in MLRA 127 is questionable.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon include:\n1. Udic soil moisture regime (a humid, temperate climate).\n2. Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 10 cm [0 to 4 in] (A horizon)\n3. Cambic horizon - from 10 to 86 cm [4 to 34 in] (Bw and BC horizons)\nCharacterization data is available for 1 pedon from Sullivan Co. NY (S79NY105 9).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
