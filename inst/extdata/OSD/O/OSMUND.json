  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In some pedons a distinct cambic horizon may be absent but in these areas the mollic epipedon is noncalcareous in at least the upper part, and has brighter chroma, redder hue, moderate structure of evidence of carbonate removal in the lower part, and is underlain by a continuous horizon of visible carbonate accumulation.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 40 inches thick, depth to calcareous material ranges from 10 to 40 inches, the solum is 16 to 40 inches thick.  The content of organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .8 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with depth.  The matrix material within the control section is typically loam or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay, 20 to 55 percent silt, and 20 to 50 percent sand, with more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser including coarse fragments, and with less than 35 percent in the upper part of the control section, and from 35 to 80 percent in the lower part.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 46 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 to 58 degrees F.  The A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 1 through 3.  It usually has fine granular or crumb primary structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft to slightly hard and neutral to mildly alkaline.  The B2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It has typically subangular blocky primary structure but has weak prismatic structure in some pedons.  This horizon is neutral to slightly acid.  The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It contains about 3 to 14 percent calcium carbonate.  This horizon is gravelly or very gravelly loam or clay loam.  It is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

Adel, Bullrey, Idmon, Kennally, Lamphier, Nutrioso and Reca soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Gallatin soils lack a loamy-skeletal substratum above 40 inches.  Karlan soils have a lithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  Leavittville soils have a gravel-free upper control section at least 20 inches thick and have less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser including coarse fragments in the control section.  Mundos soils have lithochromic hue of 5YR or redder.  Pavohroo soils lack a loamy-skeletal substratum above 40 inches and are noncalcareous."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Osmund soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans and valley filling sideslopes.  Slopes usually range from 0 to about 10 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous, alluvial fan sediments derived from a variety of crystalline rock.  At the type location the average annual precipitation is 18 inches with nearly equal amounts of precipitation occurring during most months.  The mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 58 degrees F."
