Lantz soils have 14 to 40 percent rock fragments in the substratum. Olmsted soils do not have an albic horizon and typically contain gravel in some part of the solum.  Varick soils contain calcareous clayey shale soft fragments within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

Slopes typically are plane or concave with gradients of 0 to 2 percent.  Orio soils formed in stratified loamy and sandy outwash or alluvium.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 12.2 degrees C (50 to 54 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 890 to 1067 mm (35 to 42 inches)."

Alvin, Bloomfield, and Roby soils average less than 18 percent clay in the control section and do not have surface layers as much as 15 cm (6 inches) in thickness that have color value of 3 or less.  Alvin and Bloomfield soils are on nearby ridges, slopes, and dunes.  Roby soils are on slightly higher parts of outwash plains or stream terraces nearby.  Gilford, La Hogue, Onarga, and Selma soils have mollic epipedons and do not have albic horizons.  In addition, Gilford and Onarga soils average less than 18 percent clay in the control section; the somewhat poorly drained La Hogue soils have higher chroma in the matrix or on faces of peds in the upper part of the argillic horizon; and Selma soils do not have an argillic horizon.  Gilford and Selma soils are on similar nearly level to depressional areas nearby.  La Hogue and Onarga soils are on higher lying or more sloping parts of stream terraces or outwash plains."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Orio series was formerly classified as fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal Mollic Albaqualfs.  We find that Orio soils lack both an abrupt textural change and a strongly contrasting particle size class.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - 0 to 23 cm (0 to 9 inches) (Ap); argillic horizon - 46 to 89 cm (18 to 35 inches) (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Data for some pedons of Orio are on file at the Illinois state office.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
