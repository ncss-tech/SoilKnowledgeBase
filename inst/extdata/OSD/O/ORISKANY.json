    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments of sandstone and quartzite range from 15 to 65 percent in the A and E horizons, and 35 to 75 percent in the B and C horizons. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Combinations of value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 are limited to 6 inch or less thickness. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8. It is sandy loam, loam, or sandy clay loam in the fine- earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brushy, Grimsley and Joppa series in the same family. Brushy is moderately deep and rock fragments are chert.  Grimsley soils have bedrock between 40 and 60 inches. Joppa soils have solum thickness of 20 to 40 inches and are formed in fluvial outwash on coastal plain terraces. The Brushy and Pocono series may be competitors when they are updated.  Brushy soils have a lithic contact between 20 to 40 inches.  Pocono soils formed in glacial till and have rock fragments that are glacial erratics.  The Bender and Lostcove series are in a closely related family.  Bender soils have a lithic contact within 20 to 40 inches of the surface.  Lostcove soils have rock fragments from metasedimentary rock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Oriskany soils are in coves and on slightly convex to linear foot slopes and colluvial fans at the base of steeper mountain side slopes. Slope gradients are most commonly 2 to 30 percent slopes, but range from 2 to 60 percent slopes. The soils formed in colluvial materials from acid sandstone, and quartzite, with small amounts of shale in the Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valley MLRA. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F."

Berks, Dekalb, and Lily soils are on surrounding uplands and have bedrock at depths of less than 40 inches. Escatawba, Jefferson, Laidig, Lily, Shelocta, and Tumbling soils are non-skeletal. Escatawba soils have one or more lithologic discontinuities within the series control section. Laidig soils have a fragipan. Shelocta soils have more silt in the subsoil. Tumbling soils have more clay in the subsoil."
