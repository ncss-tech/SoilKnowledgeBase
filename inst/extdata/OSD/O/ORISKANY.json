Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Combinations of value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3 are limited to 6 inch or less thickness. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Brushy, Grimsley and Joppa series in the same family. Brushy is moderately deep and rock fragments are chert.  Grimsley soils have bedrock between 40 and 60 inches. Joppa soils have solum thickness of 20 to 40 inches and are formed in fluvial outwash on coastal plain terraces. The Brushy and Pocono series may be competitors when they are updated.  Brushy soils have a lithic contact between 20 to 40 inches.  Pocono soils formed in glacial till and have rock fragments that are glacial erratics.  The Bender and Lostcove series are in a closely related family.  Bender soils have a lithic contact within 20 to 40 inches of the surface.  Lostcove soils have rock fragments from metasedimentary rock."

Slope gradients are most commonly 2 to 30 percent slopes, but range from 2 to 60 percent slopes. The soils formed in colluvial materials from acid sandstone, and quartzite, with small amounts of shale in the Southern Appalachian Ridges and Valley MLRA. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F."

Escatawba soils have one or more lithologic discontinuities within the series control section. Laidig soils have a fragipan. Shelocta soils have more silt in the subsoil. Tumbling soils have more clay in the subsoil."
