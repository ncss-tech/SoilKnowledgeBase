  "OVERVIEW": "The Ordnance series consists of deep and moderately deep, well-drained soils on gently undulating uplands.  They are derived from thin-bedded, reddish-gray, clayey shale and reddish-brown sandstone of the Chinle formation. These soils occur at elevations of 7,600 to 8,100 feet, where the average annual precipitation is 15 to 19 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44? F.",

The C horizon is gray, dark reddish-gray, and dark reddish-brown.  The depth to clayey shale ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  In most places, the profile is free of coarse fragments to a depth of 20 inches or more; in other places there are many fragments of shale and sandstone.  The variations in composition and color are attributed to variations in the parent shale"
