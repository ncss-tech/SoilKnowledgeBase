  "OVERVIEW": "The Orose series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in material from basic intrusive igneous rocks, mainly gabbrodiorite. Orose soils are on foothills and have slopes of 3 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 16 degrees C.",
