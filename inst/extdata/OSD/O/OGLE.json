Ashdale soils have more clay in the lower part of the B horizon. Broadwell soils contain more sand in the lower part of the B horizon, have sola less than 152 cm (60 inches) thick and are underlain by sand within 152 cm (60 inches). Dinsdale, Parkway, Sidell, and Tecumseh soils formed in loess and glacial till, have more weatherable minerals in the 2Bt horizons, and do not have horizons with 5YR or redder hue dominant in the matrix or as on ped surfaces. Douglas, Elkhart Lycurgus, Osco, Tama, and Wakenda soils are formed entirely in loess or other silty material, contain less sand in the lower part of the B horizon, and do not have 2Bt horizons with 5YR or redder hue dominant in the matrix or on ped surfaces. Elmont soils have sola less than 4 feet thick and are partially developed in residuum from shale. Healing and Mickle soils have less sand in the lower solum and formed in alluvium. Malcolm and Mendota soils are less than 152 cm (60 inches) to the base of soil development. Meadowbank, Plano, Proctor, Richwood and Toddville soils formed in loess and loamy outwash, have more weatherable minerals in the 2Bt horizon, and do not have horizons with 5YR or redder hue dominant in the matrix or on ped surfaces. Ripon soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to a lithic contact. Sibley soils have a mollic epipedon more than 61 cm (24 inches) thick. Waupecan soils contain more gravel in one or more of the 2Bt horizons."

These soils formed in 76 to 127 cm (30 to 50 inches) of loess and Late Sangamon paleosol formed in sandy loam, loam or clay loam Illinoian till. Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.3 to 10.0 degrees C (47 to 50 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation ranges from 840 to 940 mm (33 and 37 inches)."

Flagg and Myrtle soils occur on the same landscape as Ogle soils but generally are closer to major drainageways."
