    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture - Usually wet during winter and spring and moist during summer and fall. These soils occur downstream from springs and seeps and remain moist throughout the profile in most years; aquic moisture regime that borders on xeric.\nMean annual soil temperature - 44 to 46 degrees F.\nMean summer soil temperature - 59 to 61 degrees F.\nDepth to horizons with aquic conditions - 0 to 12 inches.\nMollic epipedon thickness - 12 to 18 inches.\nCracks - Few or common which open and close in normal years.  The root mass in the upper few inches of the soil usually obscures or prevents the cracks from opening to the surface.  The soil surface is not self-mulching.\nDepth to bedrock - 45 to 60 inches to a paralithic contact.  The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered basalt.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 45 to 60 percent;  Rock fragments; 15 to 35 percent, mainly pebbles and cobbles.  Lithology of fragments are basalt.\nReaction - Neutral or slightly alkaline.\nOther features - Redox concentrations are not normally present in the horizons with low chroma that constitute the mollic epipedon, due to masking by high amounts of dark organic matter.\nA horizons - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry.\nChroma: 1 or 2, moist or dry.\nClay content: 40 to 45 percent.\nRock fragments: 5 to 30 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 2 to 4 percent.\nBss1 horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry.\nChroma: 2 or 3, moist or dry.\nTexture: Clay or silty clay.\nClay content: 50 to 60 percent.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.\nBss2 horizon - Hue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 2 through 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry.\nChroma: 2 or 3, moist or dry.\nTexture: Clay or silty clay.\nClay content: 50 to 60 percent.\nRedoximorphic features: few or common, distinct or prominent redox concentrations of iron.\nBC horizon - Hue: 5YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 2 through 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry.\nChroma: 2 or 3, moist or dry.\nTexture: Very cobbly clay or very cobbly silty clay.\nClay content: 45 to 55 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 60 percent.\nRedoximorphic features: few or common, distinct or prominent redox deletions or redox concentrations of iron.\nC horizon - Hue: 7.5YR or 10YR.\nValue: 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry.\nChroma: 3 or 4, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly clay or very cobbly clay.\nClay content: 40 to 50 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 60 percent."

Elevations range from 5,100 to 5,300 feet.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 20 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F., mean January temperature is 25 to 28 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 60 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Poorly drained; medium surface runoff; slow permeability.  Endosaturation is present with a seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 12 inches (very shallow and shallow internal free water occurrence classes) from December to May.  During summer months in normal years the zone of saturation drops between 26 and 42 inches.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils receive run-on moisture and are frequently ponded for very long duration (more than 45 consecutive days in normal years), mainly in the late winter and spring.  They can be ponded for as long as 4 months in a normal year and periods of brief duration ponding can occur after intense rainfall events.  Depth of water during ponding is 2 to 6 inches."
