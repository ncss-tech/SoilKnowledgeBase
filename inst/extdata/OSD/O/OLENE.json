Endosaturation is present with a seasonal high water table between the soil surface and 12 inches (very shallow and shallow internal free water occurrence classes) from December to May.  During summer months in normal years the zone of saturation drops between 26 and 42 inches.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils receive run-on moisture and are frequently ponded for very long duration (more than 45 consecutive days in normal years), mainly in the late winter and spring.  They can be ponded for as long as 4 months in a normal year and periods of brief duration ponding can occur after intense rainfall events.  Depth of water during ponding is 2 to 6 inches."
