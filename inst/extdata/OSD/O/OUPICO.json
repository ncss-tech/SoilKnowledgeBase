  "OVERVIEW": "The Oupico series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks.  Oupico soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
