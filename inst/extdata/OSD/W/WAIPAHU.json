  "OVERVIEW": "The Waipahu series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium weathered from basic igneous rock.  Waipahu soils are on dissected terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 25 to 35 inches and mean annual temperature is about 75 degrees F.",

The amount of montmorillonite increases as depth increases.  The soil is dry in some horizons for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.  The solum has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue of the A and B horizon is 2 through 4 moist, and value in the B horizon is 4 or 5 dry.  Chroma in the A and B horizons is 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry."
