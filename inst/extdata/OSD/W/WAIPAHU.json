  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Average annual soil temperature is about 75 degrees F.  The clay fraction is a mixture of kaolinite and montmorillonite.  The amount of montmorillonite increases as depth increases.  The soil is dry in some horizons for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.  The solum has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue of the A and B horizon is 2 through 4 moist, and value in the B horizon is 4 or 5 dry.  Chroma in the A and B horizons is 2 or 3 moist and 3 through 5 dry."
