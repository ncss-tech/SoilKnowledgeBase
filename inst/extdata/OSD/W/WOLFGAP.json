Gravel\nand cobbles range from 0 to 35 percent in the Ap and Bw horizons\nand from 15 to 80 percent in the C horizon. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline throughout the soil.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and\nchroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt\nloam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of\n2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and\nchroma of 4 through 6. In some pedons, the upper Bw horizon has\nvalue of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is loam, silt\nloam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of\n3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. It is loamy sand, sandy\nloam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, or clay\nloam in the fine-earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wolfgap soils are on flood plains. Slopes\nrange from 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium\nderived from limestones, sandstones, siltstones, and shales of Ordovician, Silurian, Devonian, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian ages. In Virginia, Wolfgap soils are on floodplains of the North Forks of the Holston and Shenandoah Rivers, the James River and\nits tributaries, and Reed Creek. Wolfgap soils also are on floodplains of portions of the Maury River and other streams that drain areas underlain by rocks of the above lithologies and ages.  Climate is temperate and humid. The mean air temperature ranges\nfrom 50 to 57 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges\nfrom 30 to 45 inches."

Alonzville, Botetourt, Caverns, Coursey, Ingledove, and Shottower soils have argillic horizons\nand are on stream terraces. Berks, Lehew, and Weikert soils are shallower to bedrock, contain more rock fragments in the subsoil,\nand are on uplands. Broadway, Gullion, and Nomberville soils\ncontain more silt in the subsoil and are on similar landscapes.  Gladehill soils contain less clay in the subsoil and are on\nsimilar landscapes. Derroc soils contain more rock fragment in\nthe subsoil and are on similar landscapes. Frederick and\nGroseclose soils are well drained, contain more clay in the\nsubsoil, and are on uplands. Irongate soils are moderately well drained and are on similar landscapes. Moomaw soils have a\nfragipan and are on stream terraces. Newmarc soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on similar landscapes."
