  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is 60 to 80 inches or greater.  Thickness of the loess ranges from 5 to 15 inches.  Volume of chert fragments ranges from 0 to 22 percent in the loess and from 0 to 35 percent in the clayey residuum.  Volume of chert fragments larger than 3 inches in size ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon.  The A horizon is neutral to medium acid and the B horizon is medium acid to extremely acid.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is silt loam or cherty silt loam.  Where present, the A horizon is 3 to 6 inches thick.\nThe Bt1 horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, or cherty analogues.\nThe 2Bt horizon has 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR hue; value of 3 through 6; and chroma of 4 through 8.  Many pedons have variegated colors or layers with 10YR hue.  They are typically silty clay or clay, or cherty analogues, but thin individual horizons of sandy clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam, or cherty analogues are within the range."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Other closely related series are Dodgeville, Dubuque, Dunbarton, NewGlarus, Palsgrove, Southridge, and Valton.  Dodgeville, Dubuque, and NewGlarus soils are underlain by limestone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  In addition, Dodgeville soils have a mollic epipedon; Dubuque soils are fine-silty; and NewGlarus soils are fine-silty over clayey.  Dunbarton soils have a lithic contact at less than 20 inches.  Palsgrove soils formed in 36 to 55 inches of loess and have only the lower part of the solum formed in residuum weathered from limestone.  Southridge soils are similar but have a lighter colored surface and contrasting textures because of the thicker loess mantle.  Valton soils are similar but formed in thicker loess over clayey residuum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wildale soils are on ridgetops and side slopes (back slopes) in strongly dissected uplands underlain by thick clayey residuum over limestone.  Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent.  They formed in 5 to 15 inches of loess and in the underlying clayey residuum weathered from limestone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the NewGlarus, Palsgrove, Reedsburg, and Valton soils.  Nearby, where the limestone is at a depth of 20 to 40 inches on side slopes of ridgetops, are the NewGlarus soils.   On similar slopes as Wildale, but in areas of thicker loess over the residuum, the Palsgrove and Valton soils are nearby.  Where the loess is thicker and the ridgetops somewhat broader, the somewhat poorly drained Reedsburg soils are in drainageways and depressions, or on the upper side slopes of ridgetops."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Refer to National Soil Survey Laboratory numbers 77P2172-77P2179 for data on the typical pedon.  Depending upon thickness of loess and texture of the upper part of the residuum, some pedons of Wildale may be very fine.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon zone from 9 to 60 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, 2Bt5, 2Bt6, and 2Bt7 horizons); clay distribution that does not decrease from its maximum amount by as much as 20 percent of that maximum within a depth of 1.5 m from the soil surface; hue redder than 10YR and chroma more than 4 dominant in the matrix of at least the lower part of the argillic horizon; Ap horizon with value (moist) of less than 4 and value (dry) of less than 6; udic moisture regime; mesic temperature regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
