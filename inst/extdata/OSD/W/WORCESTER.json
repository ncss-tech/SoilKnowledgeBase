    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  (Unless otherwise stated, thickness and depth in the following paragraph is measured from the top of the mineral soil.)  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to sandy outwash range from 24 to 40 inches.  In some pedons, the solum extends several inches into the underlying sandy outwash.  The upper part of the particle-size control control section averages from 8 to 17 percent clay and more than 50 percent fine sand or coarser.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the upper part of the series control section.  Volume of gravel, ranges from 0 to 35 percent throughout the loamy mantle, but is typically less than 15 percent. Volume of gravel averages from 3 to 50 percent in the sandy outwash, but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the soil, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid below the spodic horizon.  Redox features are in the albic or the spodic horizon within a depth of 20 inches.  Aquic conditions occur within a depth of 20 inches at some time in most years.\nSome pedons have an Oa or Oe horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral.  Value is 2 or 3 and chroma in 0 to 3.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR or is neutral in hue. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture of the A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  The E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy sand or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6, or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  It has texture like the Bhs horizon above.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, loamy sand or the gravelly analogs.\nTypically, Worcester soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon described above.  The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.  Some pedons do not have a glossic horizon\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture the Bt part described above.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is stratified sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs. Sand content averages more than 85 percent in the fine earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on glacial lake plains, outwash plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Worcester soils formed mostly in loamy alluvium and in the underlying stratified sandy outwash.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1900 feet."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to low. Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2 feet at some time during the period October to June in most years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Timber stands are mostly red maple, sugar maple, paper birch, quaking aspen, and balsam fir, but yellow birch and eastern hemlock are in most stands.  Some areas are used for cropland or pastureland.  Corn, small grain, and hay are the principal crops."
