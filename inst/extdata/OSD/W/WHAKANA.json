    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 60 to more than 80 inches thick.  Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 8 to 20 inches. The control section has 18 to 30 percent clay and more than 20 percent silt.\nThe A horizon has colors in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Horizons with value and chroma of 3 or less are to thickness of less than 6 inches thick.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon is brown has colors in hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Some BE horizons have chroma of 6.  It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has red colors in hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.   Few to common mottles of these same colors occur in most pedons.  The Bt horizon is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt/E horizon has red colors in hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is loam or sandy clay loam and ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.  Silt coats, pockets, and tongues of light gray (10YR 6/1, 7/1) and white (10YR 8/1) E material comprise 5 to 30 percent of the horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Naldo and Vesey series in the same family and the similar Bastrop, Bernaldo, Cahaba, Dougherty, Duralde, Elysian, Glenmora, Kamie, Konawa, Macon, Messer, Ruston, and Woden series.  Bastrop, Dougherty, and Konawa soils are dry for longer periods of time and do not have albic materials in the lower Bt horizon.  Bernaldo soils have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR in the Bt horizon and have siliceous mineralogy.  Cahaba and Ruston soils have less than 35 percent base saturation.  Duralde and Glenmora soils have fine-silty textures and have mottles with chroma 2 or less in the upper part of the sola.  Elysian, Messer, and Woden soils have less than 18 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon and have siliceous mineralogy.  Kamie soils lack tongues of E material in the Bt horizon.  Macon soils lack albic materials in the lower Bt horizon and are more clayey.  Naldo soils have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR in 7.5YR in the Bt horizon. Versey soils have epipedons more than 20 inches thick.  GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whakana soils are on high stream terraces of the Red River in the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent but are dominantly less than 5 percent.  The soils formed in alluvial sediments high in silt.  The average temperature at the site location is 64 degrees F.  The average annual rainfall is 45 inches and the annual Thornthwaite P-E index is 78."
