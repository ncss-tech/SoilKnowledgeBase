  "OVERVIEW": "The Whippany series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty and clayey sediments derived principally from shale, basalt, and granite.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet. Coarse fragments are commonly lacking\nbut range up to 5 percent above 40 inches and up to 30 percent below.  Base saturation 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon, ranges from 60 to 90\npercent.  Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid near the surface and increases with depth to slightly acid through slightly alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2.  Values of 3 are restricted to A1 horizons which are less than 6 inches thick.  Texture ranges from silty clay loam to loam. Some pedons have a BE or E horizon with hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4 with similar textures to the A horizon.\nThe Bt or Btg horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Low and high chroma redoximorphic features are strongest on faces of peds and interiors within the top 10 inches of the argillic horizon and diminishes with increasing depth.  Individual subhorizon textures range from silty clay loam to clay with the weighted percent clay for the Bt horizon more than 35 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Textures are stratified loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam above 40 inches and range to loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand below 40 inches."

Banister, Branchville, Celina, Eudy, Hartville, Jerktail, Loudon, and Tarlton soils are from outside LRR R.\nBanister and Hartville soils have mean annual soil temperatures greater than 55 degrees. Branchville soils have an argillic horizon deeper than 50 inches. Cardinal and Loudon soils effervesce in the subsoil and substratum.   Celina soils are 20 to 40 inches to a densic contact.  Eudy and Tarlton soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock. Jerktail soils are 60 to 80 inches to bedrock."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whippany soils are on slight elevations on terraces or gently sloping peripheral areas within large topographic basins.  These soils\nformed in silty and clayey sediments containing a high proportion of fines derived from weathered shale, basalt and granite materials.  Slope is 0 to 8 percent. The climate is humid temperate.  Average annual precipitation is 40 to 48 inches and the growing season is about 140 to 170 days.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately low or moderately high. The water table is at or near the surface briefly during late winter and early spring and drops to a depth of at least 4 feet in the summer."

Cation exchange activity class assigned based upon a review of limited data for similar soils. Geographic coordinates determined from narrative description in published soil survey and should be considered approximate.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 9 inches (Ap horizon)\n2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 9 to 40 inches averages more than 35 percent clay (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3 horizons)\n3) Aquic subgroup - has depletions with chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon in the zone of 15 to 27 inches (Bt2 horizon)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
