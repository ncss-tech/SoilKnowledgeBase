    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist and is dry for less than 45 consecutive days between the depths of about 4 and 12 inches after the summer solstice. The soils are saturated with water at a depth of 2 to 3 feet during the winter unless artificially drained. The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F. Depth to iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less is 24 to 40 inches. The difference between the mean winter and mean summer soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F under canopy cover. The particle-size control section has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand and averages less than 35 percent clay. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches. The upper 5 to 8 inches has an estimated Alox + Feox of 2.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.80 to 0.90 g/cc. The lower 5 to 12 inches has an estimated Alox + Feox of 1.0 to 3.0 percent and a moist bulk density of 0.90 to 1.0 g/cc. Andic soil properties, when present, do not extend beyond a depth of 14 inches. It is extremely acid through moderately acid.\nThe A and AB horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 and 3 moist and dry. Texture is medial silt loam.  It has 18 to 27 percent clay by field estimate.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 through 5 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 22 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2BC or 2C horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 1 through 8 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with 27 to 45 percent clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Walluski soils are on Coastal marine and valley terraces at elevations of 20 to 300 feet. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The soils formed in moderately fine textured alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches. The mean annual temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F., mean January temperature is 40 degrees F., mean July temperature is 60 degrees F. The frost-free period is 145 to 300 days. The soil is on the Whiskey Run geomorphic surface."

Chitwood soils are fine textured, somewhat poorly drained and occur on nearly level to concave areas. Hebo soils are fine textured, poorly drained and occur in swales and concave areas. Knappa soils are well drained and have an umbric epipedon 20 to 30 inches thick and occur on nearly level to convex areas."

Other uses include timber production, recreation and wildlife habitat. Native vegetation includes western hemlock, Sitka spruce, Douglas-fir, red alder with an understory of vine maple, salmonberry, red elderberry and western swordfern."

If accepted, medial modifiers would be used for those horizons meeting the andic subgroup criteria although not always meeting andic soil properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
