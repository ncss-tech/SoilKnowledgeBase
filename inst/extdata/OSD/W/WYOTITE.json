  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to 22 inches.  Rock fragments are typically absent but range from 0 to 5 percent.  Depth to continuous accumulation of calcium carbonate ranges from 10 to 20 inches, but the soils may be weakly calcareous below the surface in some pedons which receive intermittent recharge.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 22-28, but is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Textures are clay loam or silty clay loam, with 28 to 35 percent clay, 45 to 65 percent silt and very fine sand, and less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btk horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is considered part of the argillic horizon and has textural properties similar to the Bt horizon.  It has 4 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has 4 to 12 percent calcium carbonate equivalent that decrease with depth.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Blanding series.  It is assumed the Nepesta and Tensleep series are competing pending an update of the classification.  Blanding soils have a mean annual soil temperature of more than 51 degrees.  Tensleep Witt soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the Bt horizon and below.  Nepesta soils have an overly thickened, manmade Ap horizon that borders on a mollic epipedon, and are very high in available nitrogen and phosphate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wyotite soils are on alluvial fans, fan remnants, plateaus, terraces and pediments.  They formed in locally transported alluvial material or loess derived from silty shale and very fine grained sandstone.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations are 3,600 to 5,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches, half of which falls as rain and snow from late March through June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 44 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
