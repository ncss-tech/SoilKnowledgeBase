    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 10 inches thick.  A calcic horizon is present at depths of 14 to 18 inches.  The soil material is estimated to be 8 to 20 feet thick over bedrock.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent in the particle size control section.  These soils have a mean annual soil temperature of about 44 to 47 degrees F. and a mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is about 59 to 64 degrees F.  The soils are moist in some part of the moisture control section for more than 1/2 of the time the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  They are dry in all parts of the soil between depths of 8 and 24 inches for less than 60 consecutive days within a 3 month period following the summer solstice in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 to 6.  Clay content is 25 to 35 percent.  Rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 dry, 4 to 8 moist and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is typically very cobbly loamy sand, very cobbly loam or extremely cobbly sandy loam.  Clay content is 10 to 20 percent.  Rock fragment is 50 to 65 percent.  They are strongly calcareous or very strongly calcareous.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
