  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section typically averages between 25 and 35 percent clay and 15 to 45 percent fine and coarse sand.  It contains 0 to 10 percent by volume of hard shale fragments in the solum.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It typically is silt loam or clay loam and some is loam or silty clay loam.  It is neutral to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  It is neutral to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has 2.5Y or 5Y hue, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, or gravelly loam.  Some pedons contain diffuse and segregated carbonates at depths of 36 to 60 inches.  Some contain sand and gravel composed mostly of shale within depths of 40 to 60 inches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Aastad, Darnen, Delette, Lankin, Lismore, and Svea series in the same family and the Beotia, Embden, Emrick, La Prairie, Overly, and Waubay series.  Aastad and Svea soils have formed in till and have Bk horizons.  Darnen soils average between 18 and 30 percent clay in the 10- to 40-inch control section and do not have shale fragments.  Delette soils are slightly to strongly acid.  Lankin and Lismore soils have Bk horizons.  Beotia, Overly, and Waubay soils are fine-silty.  Embden and Emrick soils are coarse-loamy.  La Prairie soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter with depths."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Walsh soils are on glacial terraces, deltas, fans, and foot slopes.  Slope gradients commonly are less than 3 percent, but some range to 15 percent on a few fans and foot slopes.  The soils formed in glacial alluvium which was derived from shale or glacial till containing a high amount of shale.  The climate is cool, subhumid. Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 20 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

La Prairie soils are on flood plains. Gardena and Overly soils are on nearby lake plains. Both soils are silty.  Svea soils are on nearby till plains.  Barnes, Buse, and Edgeley soils are on nearby till plains and have thinner mollic epipedons.  Brantford soils are on nearby outwash plains and Vang soils are on similar landscapes as Walsh soils.  These soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Coe and Kloten soils are on hills and side slopes above the fans and foot slopes.  Coe soils are sandy-skeletal and Kloten soils are shallow.  Divide soils are in swales and depressions and have calcic horizons within 16 inches of the surface."
