  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact (Cr horizon) is 8 to 20 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid, throughout.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 10 to 50 percent in the A horizon, and from 35 to 90 percent in the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 4.  It is sandy loam, loam, silt loam, with channery or very channery modifiers.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam, loam, silty clay loam, and clay loam with very channery or extremely modifiers.\nThe Cr horizon consists of tilted, fractured, weathered phyllite, slate, or rarely schist.  It is rippable to 4 or 5 feet with light machinery.  Tongues of Bt material extend into the underlying material to depths of 4 feet along fracture planes.\nThe R horizon consists of tilted, fractured, hard phyllite, slate, or rarely schist.  It is rippable to 4 or 5 feet with light machinery."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Sunlight series is the only soil in the same family.  Competing series in similar families are Armuchee, Gorgas, Hector, Manteo, Montevallo, Mountainburg, Pickens, Sulphura, Talladega, and Tallapoosa soils.  Sunlight soils formed in shaly siltstone or shale residuum.  Armuchee soils have a clayey control section.  Gorgas, Hector, Manteo, and Pickens soils have less coarse fragments.  Hector, Manteo, Montevallo, Pickens, and Sulphura soils lack argillic horizons although Sulphura soils have a Bt horizon that is broken by rock in some part of the pedon.  Talladega soils have a mean soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F.  Tallapoosa soils have micaceous mineralogy."

Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 53 inches and mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F."

These soils are deeper than 20 inches to Cr and have less than 35 percent fragments in the argillic horizon and are generally on lower positions of the landscape.  In addition, Tatum soils have fine textured Bt horizons."

The 8th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy changed subgroups for shallow families.  Ochreptic (Inceptic) Hapludults may not be in shallow families.\nRev: RLV - 3/99"
