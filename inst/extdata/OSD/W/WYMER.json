  "OVERVIEW": "The Wymer series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered mainly from serpentine or ultramafic bedrock with ash influence in the surface layers.  Wymer soils are on hills having slopes of 3 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 41 centimeters (16 inches) and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C. (42 degrees F.).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C. (42 to 47 degrees F.).  The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 10 and 30 centimeters (4 and 12 inches) for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Serpentine rock fragments in the upper 50 centimeters (20 inches) of the Bt horizon range from 10 to 35 percent by volume.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon is 25 to 50 centimeters (10 to 20 inches) and includes the upper part of the Bt horizon. Hue in the upper part is typically 10YR, but may include 7.5YR.  Base saturation by sum of bases is 75 to 90 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizons have value of 2 or 3 moist and dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is ashy clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay, 0 to 5 percent stones, 0 to 5 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It and has 15 to 40 percent glass and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 0.2 to 0.5 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 2 to 5 dry and 1 to 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and 1 to 3 dry.  It has 40 to 60 percent clay, 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 15 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe 3Bt horizon is variegated and includes colors similar to the serpentine rock colors.  It has value of 3 to 7 moist and dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  This horizon may appear to have the structure of rock material.  It has 40 to 60 percent clay, 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 15 to 35 percent gravel.\nThe 3Cr and 3R horizon varies considerably in color even within a short distance.  The highly fractured serpentine or ultramafic rocks have colors that include greenish black (10GY 2.5/1), dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1), or white (N 8/) with the shiny coating on the fracture layers characteristic of serpentine."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wymer soils are dominantly on north-facing sideslopes or footslopes or sloping benches of hills.  The elevations are 1067 to 1707 meters (3,500 to 5,600 feet).  They formed in mixed colluvium and residuum weathered mostly from serpentine or ultramafic bedrock with ash influence in the upper layers.  These soils are found in an ecotone break at the edge of the range areas and adjacent to forested areas.  This soil is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 36 to 46 centimeters (14 to 18 inches). The average mean temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C. (40 to 45 degrees F.); the mean January temperature is about -3 to -1 degrees C. (27 to 30 degrees F.); and the mean July temperature is about 13 to 16 degrees C. (56 to 60 degrees F.). The frost free season is about 50 to 70 days."

The Grell, Lemonex, Overholt, Stussi, and Widows soils lack vitrandic features.  Grell and Stussi soils are in range areas, on lower hill slopes, and are mesic, are loamy-skeletal, and lack an argillic horizon.  Grell soils are lithic.  Overholt soils are shallow to serpentine, are on shoulders and ridgetops adjacent to exposed serpentine, are loamy-skeletal, and lack an argillic horizon.  Widows soils are shallow to serpentine, are on shoulders and ridgetops adjacent to exposed serpentine, and are clayey-skeletal."
