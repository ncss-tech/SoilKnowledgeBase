  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid in the 10 to 40 inch control section and in the surface layer except where the soil has been limed.  The C horizons below 40 inches range from very strongly acid to neutral. Organic matter content in the umbric epipedon ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages more than 35 percent clay.\nThe A11 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe A12, A13, and A14 horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of N, value of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam, silty clay, or clay and ranges in thickness from 24 to 48 inches.\nAn AC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are in shades of gray or brown.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam in addition to the named textures for the umbric epipedon.\nThe C horizon is stratified grayish or brownish sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, sandy clay, or clay.  Buried A horizons are common. Marl deposits, where present, are 5 to 8 feet below the surface of the soil."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Ballahack, Cape Fear, Chastain, Johnston, Santee, Toxaway, and Wasda series.  Ballahack, Johnston, and Toxaway soils have less than 35 percent clay in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  In addition, Toxaway soils have temperatures less than 59 degrees F.  Cape Fear and Santee soils have argillic horizons and umbric epipedons that are less than 24 inches thick.  Chastain soils are kaolinitic and lack umbric epipedons.  Wasda soils have histic epipedons and they contain less clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wilbanks soils are on flood plains, low-lying terraces, and in old estuaries in the Middle and Lower Coastal Plain.  These soils formed in stratified clayey and loamy fluvial or marine sediments.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F. and average annual precipitation is about 47 inches near the type location."

Native species include southern baldcypress, sweetgum, water oak, red maple, green ash, swamp white oak, and willow oak.  Some understory plants are greenbrier, switchcane, honeysuckle, sweetbay magnolia, and sourwood.  A few areas have been cleared, drained, and are used mainly for growing corn, soybeans, and pasture"
