  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilbanks series consists of very poorly drained slowly permeable soils in the Middle and Lower Coastal Plain.  These soils formed in stratified clayey and loamy fluvial or marine sediments.  They have a thin grayish brown silt loam horizon over thick black and very dark gray clay and silty clay subsurface layers and grayish stratified C horizons.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid in the 10 to 40 inch control section and in the surface layer except where the soil has been limed.  The C horizons below 40 inches range from very strongly acid to neutral. Organic matter content in the umbric epipedon ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages more than 35 percent clay.\nThe A1 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe A2, A3, and A4 horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2; or hue of N, value of 2 or 3.  It is clay loam, silty clay, or clay and ranges in thickness from 24 to 48 inches.\nAn AC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are in shades of gray or brown.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or sandy loam in addition to the named textures for the umbric epipedon.\nThe Cg horizon is stratified grayish or brownish sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, sandy clay, or clay.  Buried A horizons are common. Marl deposits, where present, are 5 to 8 feet below the surface of the soil."
