The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 48 to 51 degrees F.   The control section contains 18 to 30 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent gravel with few cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry.  It is gravelly loam or loam.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry.  It averages gravelly silt loam and contains lenses of gravelly sandy loam, silty clay loam, or gravelly clay loam in some pedons.\nThe IIC horizon consists of stratified layers with texture ranging from very gravelly loamy sand to silty clay."

Bohannon and Brightwood soils are underlain by bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Hembre soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments to a depth of about 30 inches and are underlain by bedrock at depths of 40 to 44 inches.  Horeb soils have mottles at depths of 24 to 36 inches.  Le Bar soils have a fine, silty control section. Meda soils are medium acid throughout.  Preacher soils have less than 20 percent rock fragments in the solum and have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Stossel soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  (See remarks)"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wadell soils are on nearly level to sloping benches and fans at elevations from near sea level to 800 feet.  They formed in gravelly glacial sediments modified by sediments derived from areas of basalt.  The annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches with relatively cool summers and mild, wet winters.  The mean January temperature is about 38 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F.   The frost free season (32 degrees F.) is 150 to 180 days."
