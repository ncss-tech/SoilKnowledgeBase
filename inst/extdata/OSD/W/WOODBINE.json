  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodbine series consists of deep, well drained soils on till plains and uplands. These soils formed in thin loess, drift, and residuum from limestone. Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C (47 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches).",

Belmont, Lumberton, and Relay series average less than 50 percent clay in the lower part of the solum. High Gap and Military series have a lithic or paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Woodbine soils are on undulating to hilly till plains and moraines that are partially controlled by the underlying limestone bedrock. Slope ranges from 2 to 25 percent. These soils formed in 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 inches) of Wisconsin age loess, 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of Late Sangamon age paleosols that formed in Illinoian drift, and 5 to 25 cm (2 to 10 inches) of residuum from weathered limestone bedrock.  Summers are hot and winters are cold. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7.2 to 10.0 degrees C (45 to 50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 810 to 970 mm (32 to 38 inches) per year. Frost-free period ranges from 140 to 160 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Dubuque, Fayette, Flagg, Hitt, Myrtle, Oneco, Pecatonica, and Westville soils. Myrtle, Flagg, and Fayette soils commonly are on ridgetops above the Woodbine soils where the loess is thicker. Pecatonica and Westville soils are on similar landscape positions where the drift is thicker. Dubuque soils are associated in some places on steeper slopes or on similar slopes where glacial deposits do not occur above the bedrock. Woodbine is the light colored member of a biosequence containing Oneco soils (Mollic Hapludalfs and Hitt soils (Typic Argiudolls)."
