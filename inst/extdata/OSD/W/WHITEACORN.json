  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The WHITEACORN series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or slope alluvium derived from granite. These soils are on eroded fan remnants and alluvial flats.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 425 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 1.2 degrees C.",
