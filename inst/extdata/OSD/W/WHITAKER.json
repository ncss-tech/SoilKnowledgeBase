Angola, Mitiwanga, Nuhi, and Shadeland soils have bedrock at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches). Appleton and Burdett soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section. Ayrshire soils average more than 40 percent fine sand plus very fine sand in the lower part of the series control section. Crawleyville soils have a reaction that is more acid than slightly acid in the lower part of the series control section. Darien and Ovid soils are not stratified within the series control section. Digby and Sleeth soils average more than 14 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Mongle soils have larger rock fragments that are of mixed lithology in the lower part of the series control section."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Whitaker soils are on flats and rises on outwash plains, lake plains, till plains, valley trains, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Whitaker soils formed in stratified silty and loamy outwash sediments. Some pedons have a mantle of silty sediments up to 51 cm (20 inches) in thickness. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9.4 to 13.9 degrees C (49 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 210 days. Elevation is 110 to 305 meters (360 to 1,000 feet) above mean sea level."

In undrained areas, depth to the top of the apparent seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high. Permeability is moderate. Some areas are subject to rare to frequent periods of flooding."

The flooded phase may become a new series as subset soil surveys with this phase are updated.\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 401634 represents the typical pedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (MS7602) from the Purdue University Soil Characterization Lab, AES Bulletin 222, Vol. 4, Pg. 232. Transect data (T01IN-099-001) for the typical pedon is on file in the MLRA Project Office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 40 percent Whitaker soils, 20 percent Baugo soils, 30 percent Crosier soils, and 10 percent Brookston soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
