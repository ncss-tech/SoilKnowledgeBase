Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

The flooded phase may become a new series as subset soil surveys with this phase are updated.\nNASIS Data Mapunit ID 401634 represents the typical pedon.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab characterization data is available for the typical pedon (MS7602) from the Purdue University Soil Characterization Lab, AES Bulletin 222, Vol. 4, Pg. 232. Transect data (T01IN-099-001) for the typical pedon is on file in the MLRA Project Office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 40 percent Whitaker soils, 20 percent Baugo soils, 30 percent Crosier soils, and 10 percent Brookston soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
