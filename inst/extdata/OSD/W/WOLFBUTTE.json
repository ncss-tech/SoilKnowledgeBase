  "OVERVIEW": "The Wolfbutte series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rock and tephra.  They are on alluvial fans and stream terraces in valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
