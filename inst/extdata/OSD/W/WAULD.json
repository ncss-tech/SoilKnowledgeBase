    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but commonly are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for short periods of less than 45 consecutive days during the summer.  The depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is loam or clay loam and averages 18 to 30 percent clay and 35 to 75 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly silt loam.  It has granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is very gravelly loam or very gravelly clay loam. Rock fragments range from 20 to 55 percent gravel, 10 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones."

Aschoff soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock and have evidence of amorphous clays.  Brightwood soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Harrington soils have hue of 5YR in the B horizon.  Klickitat soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock, have hue redder than 7.5YR in the B horizon, and are strongly acid or very strongly acid.  Millicoma soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Nordby soils formed in glacial material and have soils less than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Spivey soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Summers soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in eolian material mixed with colluvium from mixed sources and residuum weathered from basalt.  The mean January temperature is 36 degrees F., mean july temperature is 64 degrees F and  the  mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 70 inches. The frost-free season is 145 to 200 days."
