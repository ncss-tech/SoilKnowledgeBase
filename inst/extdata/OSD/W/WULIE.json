  "OVERVIEW": "The Wulie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in gypsiferous eolian sands over gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. These nearly level soils are on interdunes overlying playa steps and on playa steps. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
