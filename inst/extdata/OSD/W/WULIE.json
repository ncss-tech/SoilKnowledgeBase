Astrobee and Peligro soils are formed solely in gypsiferous eolian deposits and are found on stabilized interdunes and dunes. Yesum soils are formed in gypsiferous eolian deposits and alluvium and are on fan piedmonts, alluvial fans, and relict gypsum dunes."

These soils formed from gypsiferous eolian deposits over and gypsiferous lacustrine deposits. Elevation ranges from 3,890 to 4,050 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. Precipitation falls mostly during the months of July through September. The mean annual air temperature is 64 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is 180 to 240 days."
