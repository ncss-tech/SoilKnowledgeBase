Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 10 inches or less and depth to the calcic horizon is 15 inches or less.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay loam or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.  Texture is clay loam, loam, or sandy loam with 16 to 30 percent clay.  Textures are modified with 10 to 30 percent coarse fragments, mainly pebbles, but cobbles dominate some pedons.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent. 2 - Wolf Series"

Ascalon, Asparas, Capulin, Datil, Harlan, Moskee, Noden, Satanta, and Sugardee soils have Bt horizons greater than 15 inches thick.  Harlan soils also have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt.  Bresser, Critchell, Hemingford, Lavate, Lorac, Palmer Canyon, Recluse, and Wages soils either do not have a calcic horizon above 40 inches or are noncalcareous above that depth.  Cedak, Hargreave, Hirac, Kirtley, and Rosebud soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Featherlegs soils have a 2C horizon above 40 inches containing over 35 percent coarse fragments."

Elevations are 3,500 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 19 inches with half falling as snow or rain in late March, April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F. and ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 110 to 130 days."
