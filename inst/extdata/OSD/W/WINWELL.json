  "OVERVIEW": "The Winwell series consists of very deep, well drained soils on lake terraces that formed in lacustrine sediments with some alluvial influence.  Permeability is slow.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
