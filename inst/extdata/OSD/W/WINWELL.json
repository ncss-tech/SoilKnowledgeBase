Elevations range from 4,500 to 5,100 feet.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 17 inches.  The average annual air temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The frost free period is 115 to 130 days."

Collinston soils are calcareous throughout the profile and contain less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Parleys soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and contain less than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Wheelon soils are calcareous throughout the profile and do not have a mollic epipedon.  Collinston soils are on similar to slightly convex landscape positions as compared to Winwell soils.  Parleys soils are on low lake terraces as compared to Winwell soils.  Wheelon soils are on convex high lake terraces as compared to Winwell soils."
