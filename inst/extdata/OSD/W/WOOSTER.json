  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is 34 to 60 inches.   The depth to the fragipan ranges from l8 to 40 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid to medium acid in the upper part of the solum, unless limed, and very strongly acid to neutral in the lower part of the solum and substratum.  Carbonates are at depths of 60 to l00 inches in some pedons.  Coarse fragments are dominantly sandstone, but include shale and a few crystalline rocks.  They range from 2 to 20 percent by volume in horizons above the fragipan, 5 to 25 percent in the Btx, and 5 to 30 percent in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of l0YR, value of 4 or 5 (6 or 7 dry) and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have an A horizon l to 5 inches thick that has hue of l0YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of l or 2.  The Ap or A horizon is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures.\nThe E horizon has hue of l0YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has similar texture range as the Ap or A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or l0YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It commonly is loam or silt loam, but ranges to gravelly analogues of these textures, with subhorizons of clay loam in some pedons.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  The Btx horizon is commonly loam or silt loam, or the gravelly analogues of these textures; but subhorizons of clay loam or silty clay loam are permitted.  Moist consistence is firm or very firm and brittle.   Primary structure is weak very coarse prismatic.\nThe C horizon has hue of l0YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is dominantly loam, but ranges to silt loam or sandy loam, or gravelly analogues of these textures.  Sandstone substratum phases have sandstone beginning at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bartley, Clarksburg, Comly, Gatton, Homewood, Jonca, and Readington series in the same family and the Cambridge, Canfield, and Hanover series.  Bartley soils dominantly have coarse fragments of granitic gneiss.  Clarksburg soils have coarse fragments of chert and limestone and less sand, l0 to 30 percent, in the Bt and Btx horizons.  Comly soils have low chroma mottles above the fragipan and coarse fragments dominated by shale.  Gatton soils have lithologic discontinuity below the fragipan with fine or moderately fine textures and reddish hues.  Homewood soils have sola more than 60 inches thick, typically have more than 24 percent clay, and in addition have a weaker fragipan.  Jonca soils lack coarse fragments throughout the solumn and have low chroma mottles above the fragipan.  Readington soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt and Btx horizons.  Cambridge soils lack an argillic horizon above the fragipan.  Canfield soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less in the upper l0 inches of the argillic horizon.  Hanover soils have lower base saturation.  In addition, Hanover soils typically have sola more than 60 inches thick and have a more strongly expressed fragipan."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wooster soils are on till plains and moaraines of Wisconsinan age.  Slopes have a convex surface, and gradients range from 2 to 50 percent.  The soils formed in glacial till and in many places a thin loess mantle up to l6 inches thick.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 34 to 39 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from about 49 to 52 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Canfield and the Frenchtown and Ravenna soils, all of which formed in similar materials.  Canfield soils are moderately well drained and are on short slope breaks, foot slopes, and knolls.  Frenchtown soils are poorly drained and are in depressions.  Ravenna soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on toe slopes, broad flats, and slight rises.  Chili, Conotton, Mentor, and Wheeling soils are on adjacent glacial outwash and stream terraces.  Chagrin, Holly, Lobdell, and Orrville soils are on nearby flood plains.  Loudonville and Mechanicsburg soils are on nearby areas that do not have fragipans and are underlain by bedrock."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas with slopes less than l8 percent are cultivated.  Corn, oats, wheat, mixed hay, and pasture are the principal crops.  Sizeable areas are used for woodland, habitat for wildlife, sites for buildings, and recreation uses.  The native vegetation was deciduous forest consisting mainly of sugar maple, oak, and hickory."
