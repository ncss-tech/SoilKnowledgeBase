  "STATES": "OR",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Witzel series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in loamy colluvium derived from basalt. They are on broad ridgetops and side slopes of hills and mountains. Slopes are 3 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist but are dry between 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 90 consecutive days within the 4 month period following the summer solstice in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 51 to 55 degrees F. The thickness of the solum and the depth to bedrock range from 12 to 20 inches. The particle-size control section typically has greater than 50 percent total rock fragments but ranges from 40 to 75 percent. Hue is 10YR to 5YR. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 20 inches thick. Reaction is slightly acid or moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist, 2 to 4 dry. Texture is loam or silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay. It has 15 to 35 percent gravel, 20 to 40 percent cobbles and 0 to 25 percent stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is loam, silty clay loam or clay loam with 25 to 35 percent clay. It has 15 to 35 percent gravel, 25 to 45 percent cobbles and 0 to 35 percent stones.\nThe bedrock commonly is partially fractured and in some pedons has thin tongues of soil material in the fractures."

Borid, Brisky, Buckrock, Cox and Swakane soils have less than 18 percent clay in the series particle-size control section. In addition, Borid and Cox soils have an aridic soil moisture regime. Buckrock and Swakane soils are dry for more than 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Brisky soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 51 degrees F. and are dominated by rock fragments of sandstone origin. The Rufus series has a similar classification and isotic mineralogy with a particle-size control section dominated by channer and flagstone shaped rock fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in loamy colluvium drived from basalt with a minor component of loess. The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and warm, wet winters. The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 70 inches. The mean annual is 45 to 54 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 38 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 100 to 210 days."
