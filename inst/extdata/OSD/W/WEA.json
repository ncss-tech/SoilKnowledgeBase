  "OVERVIEW": "The Wea series consists of very deep, well drained soils that are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. The Wea soils formed in loamy outwash and in the underlying gravelly outwash on kames, outwash plains, outwash terraces, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

The Warsaw soils are shallower to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash and the Waupecan soils have a thicker loess mantle.
