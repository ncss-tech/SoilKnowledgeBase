Hochheim, La Rose, Markesan, Rotamer, and Wyanet soils are less than 102 cm (40 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Lickcreek soils average more than 5 percent clay and less than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section. Linkville soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the middle part of the argillic horizon and are typically more acidic than moderately acid in the lower part of the solum. Plattville soils have a lithic contact within 152 cm (60 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wea soils are on kames, outwash plains, outwash terraces, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Wea soils formed in 61 to 102 cm (24 to 40 inches) of loamy outwash and in the underlying gravelly outwash in areas of Wisconsinan glaciation. A loess surface mantle up to 51 cm (20 inches) thick is allowed over the loamy outwash. They are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1143 mm (35 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9.4 to 11.7 degrees C (49 to 53 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Crane and moderately well drained Tippecanoe soils are on lower lying landforms. The well drained Warsaw and Waupecan soils are on similar landforms. The Warsaw soils are shallower to calcareous, stratified sandy and gravelly outwash and the Waupecan soils have a thicker loess mantle. The poorly drained or very poorly drained Westland soils are in depressions."
