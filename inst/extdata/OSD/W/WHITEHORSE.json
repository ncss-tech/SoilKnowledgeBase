    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 47 degrees F. with an 0 horizon.  The soils are usually moist but are dry during a part of the summer.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 40 inches and the thickness of the A horizon ranges from 24 to 32 inches. Rock fragments are commonly absent in the A horizon and range from 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles in the B and C horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Moist value of 3 is below 20 inches in some pedons.  It has a phosphate retention of 90 to 100 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent.  Organic matter is 5 to 10 percent.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly clay loam or gravelly loam and has 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has range in texture similar to that of the B horizon."

The soils formed in ash and alluvium and colluvium weathered from basalt and other basic igneous rocks.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and cool moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F.; the mean annual January temperature is about 25 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 55 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."
