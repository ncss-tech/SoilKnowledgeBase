  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitehorse series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in ash and alluvium and colluvium weathered from basalt and other basic igneous rocks.  Whitehorse soils are in the mountain meadows and bordering steep slopes.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 56 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist but are dry during a part of the summer.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 40 inches and the thickness of the A horizon ranges from 24 to 32 inches. Rock fragments are commonly absent in the A horizon and range from 15 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles in the B and C horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 moist and 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Moist value of 3 is below 20 inches in some pedons.  It has a phosphate retention of 90 to 100 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 3.0 percent.  Organic matter is 5 to 10 percent.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly clay loam or gravelly loam and has 20 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It has range in texture similar to that of the B horizon."
