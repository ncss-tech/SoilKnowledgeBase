  "OVERVIEW": "The Windybutte series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments and alluvium from mixed sources.  Windybutte soils are on high lake terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section is dry for one-half to three-forths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.  The particle-size control section contains 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 17 inches thick and includes the argillic horizon.  Bedrock is at a depth of greater than 60 inches.  Depth to carbonates and the brittle layer is 10 to 17 inches.\nThe A horizon has a chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon is silty clay loam or silt loam, with 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bkq horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist.  It is loam and sandy loam, with 10 to 20 percent clay.  It is moderately and strongly alkaline.  It has 2 to 5 percent calcium carbonate."
