The Miami, Riddles, Wawasee, and Morley soils are well-drained soils on slopes which surround the poorly drained Washtenaw soils in depressions.  The Crosier soils are somewhat poorly drained and are on nearly level and gently rolling topography at a slightly higher elevation."

This soil as mapped in Indiana is mostly Aeric.  The pedon in the 1974 official description was incorrectly classified as Typic Haplaquents.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
