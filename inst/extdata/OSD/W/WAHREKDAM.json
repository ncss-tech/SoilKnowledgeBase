  "OVERVIEW": "The Wahrekdam series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on uplands and ridgetops.  These soils formed in residuum derived from basic igneous rock.  Slope is 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 145 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 81 degrees F.",
