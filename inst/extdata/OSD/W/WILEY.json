  "OVERVIEW": "The Wiley series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in thick, calcareous loess. Wiley soils are on hills, plains, ridges, terraces, and valley side slopes. Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
