  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wiergate series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in weakly consolidated calcareous clays and marls.  These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands in the coastal plains.  The slope is dominantly less than 5 percent but ranges to 12 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to 80 inches.  The weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 60 to 70 percent.  When dry, cracks 1/2 to more than 1 inch wide extend from the surface to a depth of more than 12 inches.  Cracks remain open from 60 to 90 cumulative days in most years.  Slickensides and wedge-shaped peds begin at a depth of 10 to 24 inches.  Undisturbed areas have gilgai microrelief with microknolls about 4 to 12 inches above the microdepressions.  Distance from the center of the microknoll to the center of the microdepression ranges from 4 to about 15 feet.  Colors with chroma of 2 or less in the subsoil are considered to be litho-chromic.  Mottles with chroma of 3 or more, or redox concentrations, are considered to be relic or litho-chromic.\nThe A horizon ranges from 2 inches thick on the micro-high to 36 inches thick in the micro-low and is about 20 inches in most of the pedons. The A horizon has colors of dark gray or black hue of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or less.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid through mildly alkaline. Calcium carbonate concretions range from none to few.\nThe Bss and Bkss horizons have colors of gray, olive, brown or yellow hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Matrix is calcareous.  Concretions of calcium carbonate range from few to common, being mostly pitted in the upper part; few soft masses of calcium carbonate range from none to few in the lower Bw horizons.  Mottles are in shades of yellow, brown, gray, and olive and range from few to many.  Slickensides range from common to many and are a few inches to a few feet across."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Billyhaw, Pledger, and Trinity series in the same family, and the Burkeville, LaCerda and Redco series.  Burkeville, LaCerda, and Redco soils have higher values and higher chroma within 12 inches of the surface; in addition, LaCerda and Redco soils have sola that are noncalcareous in the matrix.  Billyhaw soils are poorly drained, deep and have brighter colors.  Pledger and Trinity soils are on flood plains."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wiergate soils are on broad, nearly level to gently sloping uplands.  Slopes are usually plane or slightly concave.  Slopes are mainly less than 5 percent but range to 12 percent.  These soils formed from weakly consolidated clays and marls of Tertiary age, mainly of the Fleming formation.  Mean annual rainfall ranges from 48 to 55 inches;  Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 64."

Burkeville and Redco soils are on similar positions.  Etoile and Woodville soils are mostly slightly higher in the landscape and have argillic horizons.  Garner soils are on ancient stream terraces."
