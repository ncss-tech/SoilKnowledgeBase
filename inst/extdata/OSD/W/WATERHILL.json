  "OVERVIEW": "The Waterhill series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium derived from sandstone, limestone, shale and quartzite rocks.  Waterhill soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 3 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
