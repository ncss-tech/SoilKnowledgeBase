  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum commonly is 51 to 102 cm and typically corresponds to the depth to the dense substratum. Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 183 cm.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent by volume in the solum and from 5 to 35 percent in the substratum.  Except where the surface is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded gravel and typically make up 60 percent or more of the total rock fragments.  Unless limed, reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid to a depth of 152 cm, and from strongly acid through mildly alkaline below 152 cm.\nThe O horizon, where present, commonly has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2, and chroma of 1 or 2.  In lieu texture is slightly to highly decomposed plant material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Disturbed pedons have an Ap horizon with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A or Ap horizon is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have a few faint redoximorphic features just above the Cd horizon.  The Bw horizon is commonly loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam but the range includes sandy loam.  It has weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky structure.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 10R to 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.  The horizon has weak or moderate, medium to very thick platy structure or it is massive.  Consistence is firm or very firm. The base saturation increases in some pedons below a depth of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Amostown, Bernardston, Broadbrook, Horseneck (tentative), Nantucket, Paxton, and Scituate soils. Amostown soils are underlain by stratified very fine sand or silt within a depth of 40 inches.  Bernardston and Broadbrook soils have 7.5YR or yellower hue in the B horizon.  Horseneck soils lack a densic contact. Scituate soils have sandy substrata. Nantucket soils have a lithologic discontinuity and do not have hue redder than 10YR in the substratum.  Paxton soils do not have hue redder than 7.5YR in the subsoil and substratum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wethersfield soils are nearly level to steep and are on till plains, low ridges, and drumlins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  The soils formed in acid glacial till derived mostly from reddish sandstone, shale, and conglomerate with some basalt. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C, mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1270 mm and the growing season ranges from 130 to 185 days."

The moderately well drained Ludlow, poorly drained Wilbraham, and the very poorly drained Menlo soils are associated in a drainage sequence.  Berlin soils are on lacustrine terraces.  Branford, Ellington, Hartford, and Manchester soils are on nearby outwash terraces and are underlain by stratified sand and gravel.  Cheshire soils do not have a dense substratum.  Holyoke and Yalesville soils have bedrock within 40 inches.  Newport soils have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y in the upper part of the B horizon.  The Poquonock soils and moderately well drained Birchwood soils have a sandy over loamy particle-size control section.  Watchaug soils are moderately well drained and lack a dense substratum."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Wethersfield soils were previously classified as Typic Dystrochrepts, and before that as Typic Fragiochrepts.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 3 to 8 cm (A horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 69 cm (Bw horizon).\n3. Densic material - the zone from 69 to 165 cm (Cd horizon).\n4. Oxyaquic feature - based on saturation in one or more layers within 100 cm of the mineral surface, for one month or more per year in 6 out of 10 years.  A perched water table is at a depth of 18 to 30 inches February through April.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data are available for pedons 8500052, 8500056, and 9300718 from Middlesex County, Connecticut, 1983 and 1993.  Pedon data are also published in the Soil Survey of Hartford County, Connecticut - 1962.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
