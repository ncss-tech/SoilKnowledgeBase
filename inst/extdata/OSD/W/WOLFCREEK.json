The soil between the depths of 6 and 17 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to October 15, and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 15.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent pebbles.  Organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth.  Reaction is neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 6/2, 6/4; 10YR 6/2, 6/3 or 6/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 4/2, 4/4; 10YR 4/2, 4/3 or 4/4.
