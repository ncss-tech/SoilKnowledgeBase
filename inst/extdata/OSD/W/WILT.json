The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon and the ash mantle is 7 to 14 inches thick.  The particle-size control section contains 20 to 35 percent clay and averages 35 to 50 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction is neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 moist, 5 dry and chroma of 3 moist and dry.  It contains 10 to 20 percent field estimated clay.  It contains 2 to 10 percent gravel. It contains 50 to 80 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate.  Phosphate retention is 40 to 70 percent.  The acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.40 to 1.0 percent. The 15-bar water content on dried and undried samples is 5 to 12 percent.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate is 80 to 100 percent.\nThe 2Btb horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is cobbly loam or cobbly clay loam in the upper part and very cobbly clay loam in the lower part.  Field estimated clay content is 20 to 35 percent.  It contains 10 to 30 percent gravel and 15 to 40 percent cobbles."
