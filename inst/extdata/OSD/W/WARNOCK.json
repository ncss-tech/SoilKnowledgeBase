  "OVERVIEW": "The Warnock series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy marine sediments.  These soils are on uplands of the Western Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 65 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches.",
