Fine rounded quartz pebbles range from one to about 10 percent by volume in all horizons.  Base saturation at 50 inches below the top of the Bt horizon ranges from 10 to 30 percent.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2, 3, or 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4, 6, or 8.  Mottles are in shades of red and brown.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  The silt plus very fine sand ranges from 20 to 60 percent.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5, and chroma of 4 or 6; hue of 10YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4, 6, or 8; value of 6, and chroma of 6 or 8; hue of 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 6 or 8 with mottles in shades of red, brown, or gray, or it is a mottled horizon in shades of red, brown, and gray.  Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  The silt plus very fine sand ranges from 20 to 60 percent.  Brittleness ranges from about 10 to 35 percent of mass.  Plinthite content of these horizons is less that 5 percent.\nThe Btgx horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2; hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 with mottles in shades of brown and red, or it is mottled in shades of gray, brown, and red.

Addielou soils have surface layers greater than 20 inches thick and pockets of clean sand and silt in the argillic horizon.  Allen, Bama, Etowah, Lytle, Nella, Octavia, and Ruston soils have all or some part of the Bt horizon matrix in hue of 5YR or redder.  In addition, Octavia soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the lower Bt horizon .   Avilla, Holston, Leesburg, Minvale, and Pikeville soils have coarse fragments that exceed 10 percent in all or some part of the solum.   Dubach, Noboco, and Norfolk soils do not have Btx horizons.  In addition, Noboco soils have an apparent seasonal water table at 2.5 to 4.0 feet."
