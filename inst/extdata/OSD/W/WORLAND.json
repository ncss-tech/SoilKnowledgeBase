  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact is typically 25 to 34 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material is typically 1 to 5 inches but ranges from 0 to 10 inches.  The particle size control section is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with 8 to 18 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from 2 to 15 percent.  Rock fragments consist of 0 to 15 percent sandstone channers throughout the soil.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.\nThe AC or Bw horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  EC is less than 4 mmhos.  This horizon is absent or indistinct in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y, 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 4 to 15 percent and is typically disseminated.  A nondiagnostic Bk horizon may be present in some pedons.  Gypsum ranges from 0 t 4 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Apron, Fang, Fruitland, Geer, Jeddito, Jenrid, Kumiva, Marcou, Mazuma, Piltdown, Shotnick, Sodaspring, Tooele, Trachute soils are very deep.  Ganaflan soils have tufa fragments in the control section and are moderately deep to tufa bedrock.  Moepitz soils have hue to 2.5YR or 5YR throughout and have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Vanderhoff soils have loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam particle-size control sections and developed in material high in ash or tuff.  Wentridge soils have precipitation that falls evenly throughout the year and have a lithic contact at depths of 30 to 50 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Worland soils are on erosional footslopes, backslopes, shoulders, and summits of rolling hills and ridges.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from soft, calcareous sandstone.  Elevation is 3,800 to 6,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and ranges from 5 to 9 inches of which about half falls as rain or snow in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from about 43 to 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from about 110 to 140 days depending upon elevation, aspect, and air drainage."

They occur on more stable surfaces.  The Oceanet and Persayo soils have a paralithic contact at 20 inches or less.  Wallson soils are very deep, have argillic horizons, and occur on more stable surfaces."
