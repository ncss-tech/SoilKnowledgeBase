  "OVERVIEW": "The Winterim series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from basalt and tuff.  Winterim soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 760 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
