  "OVERVIEW": "The Wayka series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on stream terraces. They formed in loamy glacial drift underlain by bedrock. Permeability is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth and thickness are measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The weighted average clay content ranges from 5 to 18 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 35 to 70 percent in the particle-size control section. Rock fragments are mostly of igneous and metamorphic origin and mixed lithology. Volume of gravel averages from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile.  Average content of rock fragments in the particle size control section ranges from 10 to 35 percent with individual horizons ranging as high as 45 percent.   Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid to neutral below the spodic horizon. Redox features are in the albic or spodic horizon within a depth of 20 inches. Saturation occurs within 20 inches for some time in most years.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is highly decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon where present has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nWayka soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2R horizon is hard, fractured igneous or metamorphic bedrock."

Timber stands are mostly red maple, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, and yellow birch with American basswood, eastern white pine, balsam fir, quaking aspen, and white ash as associates in most stands. Red pine is an associate in some stands. A few areas are cleared and used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. A few areas are used for pastureland."
