  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: (Unless otherwise stated, depth and thickness are measured from the top of the mineral soil.) Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The weighted average clay content ranges from 5 to 18 percent and the weighted average content of fine sand or coarser ranges from 35 to 70 percent in the particle-size control section. Rock fragments are mostly of igneous and metamorphic origin and mixed lithology. Volume of gravel averages from 0 to 15 percent in the upper part.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 15 percent throughout the profile.  Average content of rock fragments in the particle size control section ranges from 10 to 35 percent with individual horizons ranging as high as 45 percent.   Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum and from strongly acid to neutral below the spodic horizon. Redox features are in the albic or spodic horizon within a depth of 20 inches. Saturation occurs within 20 inches for some time in most years.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2. It is highly decomposed forest litter.\nThe A horizon where present has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. It is loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nWayka soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E part has color and texture like the E' horizon above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2R horizon is hard, fractured igneous or metamorphic bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wayka soils are on stream terraces underlain by igneous or metamorphic bedrock. Slope gradients range from 0 to 4 percent. Wayka soils formed in loamy glacial drift over bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days. Elevation ranges from 820 to 1150 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Lablatz (T) and Worcester soils are on nearby areas where the underlying bedrock is below a depth of 60 inches. Lablatz (T) soils are underlain by loamy glacial till. Worcester soils are underlain by sandy outwash."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are mostly in woodland. Timber stands are mostly red maple, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, and yellow birch with American basswood, eastern white pine, balsam fir, quaking aspen, and white ash as associates in most stands. Red pine is an associate in some stands. A few areas are cleared and used for cropland. Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay. A few areas are used for pastureland."
