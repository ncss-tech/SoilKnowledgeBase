  "STATES": "LA,MS",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Weyanoke series consists of well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium of Holocene age.  These soils are on slightly convex ridges on local stream terraces along floodplains in the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 48 inches.  Reaction ranges from medium acid to mildly alkaline throughout.  Content of total sand in the particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 20 percent.  Less than 15 percent of the sand in the  particle-size control section is fine sand or coarser.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Where value is 3, the A or Ap horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  Texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of brown.  Some pedons have mottles of chroma of 2 or less below 24 inches from the surface.  Texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon, if present, has colors similar to the Bw.  Mottles are in shades of gray or brown.  Texture is silt loam, loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the Bw.  Mottles are in shades of gray or brown.  Bedding planes range from few to many.  Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam."

Similar soils are the Ariel, Barclay, Beulah, Cascilla, Collins, Dexter, Leverette, Memphis, Morganfield, Natchez, Ouachita, Tippo, and Vicksburg soils.  Ariel soils have lower base saturation in the 10 to 40 inch control section.  Barclay soils have mottles of chroma of 2 or less within 24 inches of the soil surface.  Beulah soils have more than 15 percent fine and coarser sand in the family control section.  Dexter, Memphis and Ouachita soils are fine-silty.  Dexter and Memphis soils have an argillic horizon.  Collins, Morganfield and Vicksburg soils lack a cambic horizon.  Leverette and Tippo soils have a fragipan.  Natchez soils have slopes greater than 12 percent and formed in loess."
