  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wheelerpek soils are on mountains. They typically occur on shoulder and backslope positions. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,850 to 3,980 meters. The climate is alpine tundra, with cold wet winters and cool dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 600 to 950 mm, mean annual temperature is 0 to 3 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 20 to 40 days."
