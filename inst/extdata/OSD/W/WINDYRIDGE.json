The paralithic materials below the contact are weathered granitic rock such as granodiorite.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages less than 10 percent; Rock fragments: Averages 35 to 60 percent, mainly fine gravel.  Lithology of rock fragments is granitic rocks such as granodiorite.\nReaction - Very strongly acid through moderately acid.\nA horizon - Value: 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3 dry, 3 or 4 moist.\nOrganic matter content: 1 to 3 percent.\nBw horizon - Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 3 through 6, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly loamy coarse sand or very gravelly coarse sand.\nClay content: 4 to 10 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly fine (2 to 5 millimeter diameter) gravel.\nC horizon (when present) - Value: 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist.\nChroma: 3 through 6, dry or moist.\nTexture: Very gravelly loamy coarse sand or very gravelly coarse sand.\nClay content: 4 to 10 percent.\nRock fragments: 35 to 60 percent, mainly fine (2 to 5 millimeter diameter) gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Windyridge soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on summit and shoulder positions.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 8 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 9,000 to 11,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 55 inches, the mean annual temperature is 34 to 37 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 20 to 30 days."
