  "OVERVIEW": "The Wildgen series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in glacial till and colluvium.  These soils are on mountain slopes and moraines in glaciated valleys.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
