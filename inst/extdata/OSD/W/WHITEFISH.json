  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Aside from a rather wide range in the amount and size of stone fragments on and in the soils, these soils vary within relatively narrow limits. Where they grade into or merge with the Waits soils, the upper part of the E has a pale yellow or brownish color. Soils on 15 to 25 percent slopes have sola about as thick as those on slopes of low gradient. On slopes steeper than 25 percent gradient, the thickness of the several horizons and of the sola are less uniform."
