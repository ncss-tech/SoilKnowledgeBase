  "OVERVIEW": "The Weisburg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and in the underlying till and residuum weathered from interbedded limestone and calcareous shale. Weisburg soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12.8 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
