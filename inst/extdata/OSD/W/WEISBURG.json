Apalona, Lawrenceville, Nicholson, Omulga, and Otwood soils do not have part of the argillic horizon formed in till. Ava, Cincinnati, Grantsburg, Hosmer, Otwell, and Zanesville soils have less than 40 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Bedford soils have hues redder than 7.5YR in the lower part of the series control section. Fountainville soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Hildebrecht soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments within the fragipan. Solsberry soils have sandstone channers in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Weisburg soils are loess-mantled remnants of Illinoian age till plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Weisburg soils formed in 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches) of loess and in the underlying till and clayey residuum weathered from interbedded Ordovician limestone and gray calcareous shale of the Dillsboro formation. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1118 mm (36 to 44 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11.7 to 13.3 degrees C (53 to 56 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 200 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Carmel, Cincinnati, Eden, Rossmoyne, and Switzerland soils. The Carmel, Eden, and Switzerland soils are on hillsides at lower elevations. The sola of these soils do not contain till, and they do not have fragipans. The Cincinnati and Rossmoyne soils are on adjacent but higher and broader ridges which have a thicker mantle of till. The moderately well drained Rossmoyne soils have gray iron depletions above the fragipan."
