(Colors are for dry soil unless otherwise noted.)\nA--0 to 5 cm; pale brown (10YR 6/3) gravelly ashy sandy loam, dark brown (10YR 4/3) moist; strong thick platy structure; slightly hard, friable, nonsticky and nonplastic; many very fine, fine and medium, common coarse roots; many very fine and fine vesicular pores; 20 percent gravel; neutral (pH 6.8); abrupt smooth boundary.
