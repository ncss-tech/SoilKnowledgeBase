  "REVDATE": "02/2003",
  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodford series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy material weathered from sandstone of Mississippian age.  These gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on ridges and side slopes of uplands in the Arbuckle Mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 20 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 36 inches.",

Soils in similar families are the Aledo, Brewster, Catto, Eckert, Eckrant, Ector, Kiti, Lampshire, Lueders, Mabray, Oplin, Palopinto, Rayford, Renish, Shidler, St. Thomas, Timhill, and Volco series.  Aledo, Ector, Lueders, Mabray, Oplin, and St. Thomas soils have carbonatic mineralogy.  In addition, Mabray and St. Thomas soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Brewster, Catto, Eckert, Kiti, Lampshire, Palopinto, Rayford, Renish, Shidler, and Timhill soils have mixed mineralogy.  In addition, Brewster, Eckert, and Lampshire soils are dry for longer periods of time; Kiti soils are underlain with limestone; and Renish and Shidler soils have less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  Eckrant soils have clayey-skeletal control sections.  Volco soils have calcic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These gently sloping to moderately steep Woodford soils are on south facing convex ridges and sideslopes of uplands in the Arbuckle Mountains.  Slopes are convex and range from 3 to 20 percent.  These soils have formed in material weathered from steeply dipping sandstone bedrock of Mississippian age.  The climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 64 degrees F.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 33 to 40 inches.  Thornthwaite annual P-E index ranges from 50 to 64.  Frost free days range from 210 to 230.  Elevation ranges from 900 to 1500 feet."
