The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  The depth to a paralithic contact is 40 to 60 inches.   The clay content in the particle-size control section is 18 to 30 percent.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 34 inches thick.  Moist bulk density is 0.85 to 0.95 grams per cubic centimeter throughout.\nThe A and BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam in the upper part ranging to silt loam or loam in the lower part.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles.  Acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 the iron of 1. 0 to 2.0 percent and less than 2.0 cmol kg of the fine earth of 1N KCL extractable aluminum.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam, loam or clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles, but not exceeding 35 percent total."
