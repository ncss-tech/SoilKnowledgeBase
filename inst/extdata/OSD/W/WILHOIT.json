  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilhoit series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium weathered from andesite, breccias, and tuffs mixed with volcanic ash.  Wilhoit soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
