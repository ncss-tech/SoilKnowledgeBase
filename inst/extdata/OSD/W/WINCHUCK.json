    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 59 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 45 to 60 percent clay.   Solum thickness ranges from 36 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly to strongly acid.  Depth to stratified gravelly alluvial material is 40 to over 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  The C.E.C. of the solum by ammonium acetate is 15 to 35 meq. per 100 grams of clay. The base saturation (by sum of cations) at 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon is 10 to 30 percent.  The upper cubic meter of the solum contains 12 to 20 kilograms of organic carbon.\nThe A horizon has hue of hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  Organic matter is 4 to 8 percent.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is 35 to 40 percent clay.  Organic matter is 2 to 4 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay or clay and has 45 to 60 percent clay.  Organic matter is 2 to 4 percent.\nThe BCt horizon is commonly lighter colored and has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam and has 35 to 40 percent clay.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 moist, 6 to 8 dry and chroma of 6 to 8 moist and dry.  It is typically gravelly sandy clay loam or very gravelly sandy clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and 25 to 55 percent gravel.  Faint redox concentrations occur in some pedons."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bullgulch, Hunterscove, Loeb, Macklyn, Quinliven, Vandamme, and Wadecreek series.  Bullgulch soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F., a particle-size control section averaging 35 to 45 percent clay, an umbric epipedon greater than 20 inches thick, and a hue of 10YR throughout the Bt horizon.  Hunterscove soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F., a particle-size control section averaging 35 to 45 percent clay, and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Loeb soils have a particle-size control section averaging 35 to 45 percent clay and are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Macklyn soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact. Quinliven soils have an ochric epipedon, redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less below 50 inches, and are moderately well drained.  Wadecreek soils have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F. and redox depletions occuring in the lower Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winchuck soils are on high stream terraces.  Slopes  are 0 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in  alluvium from mixed sources.   Elevation is 100 to 400 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  The mean annual precipitation is about 70 to 90 inches.  The mean annual temperature is about 52 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 270 to 330 days.  Winchuck soils are on the Senecal geomorphic surface."

Bagness, Bayside, Bigriver, and Pistolriver soils occur on floodplains.  Ettersburg soils occur on low stream terraces.  Bagnell and Ettersburg soils are fine-loamy and are well drained.  Bayside and Bigriver soils lack argillic horizons.  Pistolriver soils have contrasting textures at depths of 20 to 30 inches and are somewhat poorly drained."
