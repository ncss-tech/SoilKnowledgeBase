  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches and extends into the B horizons of some pedons. The depth to free carbonate ranges from 18 to 35 inches and the depth to shale ranges from 22 to 36 inches.  Tongues of A horizon extend through the solum in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is fine sandy loam, but is loam or loamy fine sand in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam averaging between 20 and 35 percent clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 8.  It averages between 45 and 55 percent clay and is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a 2Bk horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, and 5Y; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is clay or silty clay and neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has up to 35 percent by volume fragments of shale.\nThe Cr horizon is bedded shale.  Accumulations of carbonate are in the upper part of the shale in most pedons.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Glenham, Gosper, Houdek, Ree, and Wineg series in the same family.  Glenham and Houdek soils contain less sand and more pebbles and formed in glacial till.  Gosper, Ree, Reventon, and Wineg do not have shale between depths of 20 and 40 inches.  In addition, Reventon and Wineg soils have a drier climate."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils formed in loamy material over residuum from clayey shales.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 46 to 50 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches."

Anselmo and Holt soils generally are above the Wewela soils and are coarse-loamy and do not have shale above depths of 40 inches.  Boyd, Lakoma, and Labu soils generally are below the Wewela soils and are fine-textured.  Woodly soils are in concave positions and do not have shale above depths of 40 inches."
