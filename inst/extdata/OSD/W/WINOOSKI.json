    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 18 through 43 inches (46 through 110 centimeters). Gravel ranges from 0 through 5 percent by volume throughout the soil. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through neutral. Depth to iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less ranges from 14 through 20 inches (35 through 50 centimeters).\nThe O horizon where present ranges in thickness from 1 or 2 inches (3 through 6 centimeters). The O has hue 7.5YR, value 2.5 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. Decompositon of the plant material ranges from fibric through sapric.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 through 4, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is silt loam, silt, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. Structure is subangular blocky, platy, or granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nSome pedons have Ab and/or AB horizons similar in characteristic to the A or Ap horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5 YR through 5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Matrix chroma of 2 is below a depth of 20 inches (50 centimeters). Texture is silt loam, silt or very fine sandy loam. Structure is granular or subangular blocky, or it is massive. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Matrix chroma of 2 is below a depth of 20 inches (50 centimeters). Texture is silt loam, silt, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. Structure is granular or subangular blocky, or it is massive. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. Matrix chroma of 2 is below a depth of 20 inches (50 centimeters). Texture is silt loam, silt, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand. Some pedons have thin strata of very fine sand, fine sand, sand, or coarse sand below a depth of 40 inches (100 centimeters). The C horizon is massive or has fine stratification. Consistence is firm through very friable.\nThe thickness and number of horizons below the A horizon is variable and corresponds to the thickness and variability of the alluvial deposits."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Otego soil is the only other soil currently in the same family. Otego soils are formed in alluvium from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. Otego soils do not allow for loamy very fine sand textures in their A, BC, or C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Winooski soils are nearly level soils on flood plains. They are typically in broad depressions. Slope ranges from 0 through 3 percent. The soils formed in recent alluvial deposits of very fine sand and silt. The source of the alluvium is from igneous and meta-igneous geology, with additions of limestone and dolomite for areas in the Lake Champlain valley, and their resultant glacial materials. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 through 50 inches (1016 through 1270 millimeters) and mean annual air temperature from 45 degrees through 52 degrees F. (7 through 11 degrees C.). Mean annual growing season ranges from 120 through 200 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Winooski soils mapped in Maine, and in MLRA 144B and 143, are now considered to be in the frigid temperature regime and are relict.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of about 8 inches (20 centimeters) (Ap horizon).\n2. Coarse-silty particle size - less than 10 percent of the material in the 10 through 40 inch (25 through 100 centimeter) zone is fine sand or coarser, including gravel, and clay averages about 7 percent.\n3. Cambic horizon the zone from 8 to 43 inches (20 to 109 centimeters) (Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons) has evidence of alteration in the form of absence of rock structure or some degree of soil structure.\n4. Aquic feature - the zone from 18 to 26 inches has redox depletions and aquic conditions at some time during the year. (Bw2 horizon)\nAdditional NSSL data: numerous full characterization pedons sampled in CT, MA, NH and VT\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
