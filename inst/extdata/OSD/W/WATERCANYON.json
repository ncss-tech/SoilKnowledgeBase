  "OVERVIEW": "The Watercanyon series consists of very deep, well drained, soils that have formed in loess and silty alluvium.  They are on foothills, mountainsides, ridges and fan terraces. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon\nCambic horizon - the zone from 2 to 16 inches (Bw1 and Bw2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - the zone from 16 to 32 inches (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nThe typical pedon does have not have free carbonates in all parts above the calcic horizon after mixing to a depth of 18 cm.; thus not a Calcixerept.  However, pedons correlated to this series in other surveys have carbonates to the surface and do classify as Calcixerepts, laboratory data supports this fact.  Earlier versions of Soil Taxonomy did not require carbonates to the surface only a calcic horizon within about 1 meter (Calcixerollic Xerochrepts).  Data in NASIS has carbontes in the surface layer, thus the typical concept of the series needs evaluation.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
