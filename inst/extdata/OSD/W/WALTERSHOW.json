The soils are dry in parts of the moisture control section for 75 to 90 days during the winter months, and are dry in all parts of the moisture control section 40 to 50 percent of the time when the soil temperature at 20 inches depth is more than 41 degrees F. The soil moisture regime is ustic bordering on aridic.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, chroma 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3; the dark colors are in the upper part. It is very cobbly clay or very cobbly clay loam. The Bt horizon has 35 to 45 percent clay and contains 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. The rock fragments are dominantly larger than 3 inches.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 6 to 8 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam. The Bk horizon has 5 to 18 percent clay and contains 25 to 70 percent rock fragments. It is moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and chroma of 2 to 4. It is extremely gravelly sand or extremely gravelly sandy loam.

The Waltershow soils formed in alluvium and colluvium from basic and intermediate igneous rocks. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The average annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches ana is distributed fairly even throughout the year with 55 to 65 percent falling between April and September with December and January being the driest. Elevation is 6,800 to 7,500 feet. The freeze-free period is about 70 to 100 days."
