    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches.  The depth to sand and gravel ranges from 14 to 25 inches.  The depth to carbonates ranges from 10 to 25 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It is sandy loam, loam or clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loam and neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk and 2Bk horizons have hue of 2.5Y or are neutral, value of 6 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma or 4 or less.  The Bk horizon is loam and the 2Bk horizon is sand or coarse sand containing 10 to 50 percent gravel.  These horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 or 7 and 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.   It is sand or coarse sand.  It commonly has more than 35 percent gravel, but it ranges from 10 to 70 percent gravel.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It is stratified or crossbedded in some pedons.  It has glacial till at depths below 40 inches in some pedons."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Warsing soils are on level and nearly level glacial outwash plains.  Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  The soil is formed in loamy alluvium over stratified sand and gravel of mixed lithology.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 20 inches, most of which falls during spring and summer."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Divide, Fordville, Renshaw and Sioux soils.  Divide soils occupy slightly lower positions and Fordville and Renshaw soils slightly higher positions in the landscape.  Fordville soils have thicker mollic epipedons.  Renshaw soils do not have redoximorphic features within a depth of 40 inches or a seasonal high water table.  Sioux soils are commonly on steeper slopes and are sandy-skeletal."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 13 inches (Ap and Bw1 horizons); cambic horizon - the zone from 13 to 15 inches (Bw2 horizon).\nThe classification was changed to the Oxyaquic subgroup even though the morphology of this pedon may meet the Aquic subgroup criteria because it was felt Oxyaquic better fit the water state of the series.  A different pedon may need to be selected to represent the series.  01/2000.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  SU64ND-14-6 from North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Station.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
