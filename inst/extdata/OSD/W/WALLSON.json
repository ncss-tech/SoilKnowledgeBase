Depth to the base of the argillic horizon and to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or calcium sulfate is 12 to 23 inches.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent pebbles throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It has weak or moderately prismatic or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is sandy loam or fine sandy loam and has more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Reaction is slightly through strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  They are sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have loamy sand strata below 40 inches.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

Brinkerhoff soils have a horizon of gypsum accumulation at 20 to 30 inches. Chacoan soils are moderately deep to hard bedrock. The Delp and Patna soils have lamellated Bt horizons.  The Enos soils are moderately deep to soft bedrock.  Granshaw soils have average annual soil teperature of 53 to 57 degrees F. Mayqueen soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Shiprock soils have a noncalcareous solum.  Woosley soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section and are moderately deep to hard bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in moderately coarse textured alluvium derived principally from sandstone.  Elevation is 4,000 to 6,300 feet.  The average annual precipitation is 5 to 9 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  The mean annual temperature is 44 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 110 to 140 days."
