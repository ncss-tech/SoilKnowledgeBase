  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 72 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 4 to 7 feet. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 36 inches. Coarse fragments, mainly sandstone, range from none to common throughout the profile. Maximum content in any part of the pedon is 15 percent. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid except for the A horizon where limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam.\nThe E part of the E/Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture is sandy loam, silt loam, or loam. The Btx part has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5, and chroma of 4 to 8. Texture is loam, silt loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or rarely 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma 4 to 8. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or rarely clay loam or silt loam. Clay content is typically 18 to 24 percent, but ranges to 30 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or rarely 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 to 8. Lithomorphic mottles in shades of red, brown, yellow, or gray are common in all Bt horizons. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, is similar to the Bt horizon in color and texture."
