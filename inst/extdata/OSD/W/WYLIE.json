The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F. Depth to paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  It also has 0 to 15 percent paragravel.  Soil reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe BAt horizon, when present, has colors similar to the A horizon.  It is clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.  Soil reaction is slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay with 40 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 20 percent paragravel.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nIn some pedons, soft powdery secondary carbonates occur just above the paralithic contact."
