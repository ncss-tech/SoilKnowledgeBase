  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodman series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in clayey drift and sandy outwash on kame moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 millimeters (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 7.8 degrees C (46 degrees F).",
