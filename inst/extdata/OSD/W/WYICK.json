  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyick series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in fluviomarine deposits of Early Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are on flats on the coastal plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
