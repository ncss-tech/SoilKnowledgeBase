  "OVERVIEW": "The Wisby series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on dissected terraces on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A).  They formed in loamy sediments over old sandy alluvium that is at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 20 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 58 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 28 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches thick.  Wisby soils do not have free carbonates within depths of 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral or moderately acid.  Gravel ranges between 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is sandy loam or loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and 45 to 75 percent medium and coarse sand.  A few pedons have strata of sandy clay loam.  Gravel ranges between 0 to 15 percent by volume.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nWhere present, the BC horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value 4 through 6 and 4 through 5 moist, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Texture is sand, gravelly sand, or loamy sand.  A few pedons have strata of gravelly sandy loam. Gravel ranges from 0 to 40 percent by volume.  This horizon ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline."
