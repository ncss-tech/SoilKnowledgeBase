  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist in the soil moisture control section, but are dry for 45 to 70 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.   Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The particle size control section has 35 to 60 percent clay and less than 10 percent rock fragments.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 25 to 35 inches which includes most of the argillic horizon.  Depth to secondary carbonates is 30 to 44 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel.  It has 5 to 25 percent glass and the acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 iron is 0.2 to 0.6 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay, clay loam, or silty clay with 35 to 60 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Soil structure is medium or strong subangular blocky, angular blocky, or prismatic.\nThe 2Btk horizon, when present, has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay.  It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 10 percent.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  It has 0 to 15 percent cobbles and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Soil reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The calcium carbonate equivalent is 2 to 5 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Cleymor, La Platta, Mondey, Shar, and Streek series.  Cleymor soils are moderately acid or slightly acid throughout, have a soil temperature of 39 to 43 degrees F., and have slickensides.  La Platta and Mondey soils lack vitrandic features.  Mondey soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick, have a soil reaction which is neutral or slightly acid in the A and Bt horizons, and are formed in sandstone.  Shar soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Streek is moderately well drained and have carbonates below 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wickiser soils are on hillsides.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  These soils are formed in colluvium derived from tuffaceous sediments with an influence of ash and loess in the surface.  Elevations are 3,400 to 5,400 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period is 30 to 80 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Canest, Diffin, Top, Tub, and Yawkey soils.  Canest soils are on ridgetops, are clayey-skeletal, and are very shallow to bedrock.  Diffin and Yawkey soils are on north-facing footslopes below basalt cliffs, are clayey-skeletal, and have an abrupt increase in clay within the surface horizons.  Top soils are found on hillsides at slightly higher elevations and have a base saturation of less than 75 percent (ultic) and lack secondary carbonates.  Tub soils are found at lower elevations and are mesic."
