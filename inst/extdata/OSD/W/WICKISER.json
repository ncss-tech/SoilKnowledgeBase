  "OVERVIEW": "The Wickiser series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium derived from tuffaceous sediments with an influence of loess and ash in the surface.  Wickiser soils are on hillsides.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Cleymor soils are moderately acid or slightly acid throughout, have a soil temperature of 39 to 43 degrees F., and have slickensides.  La Platta and Mondey soils lack vitrandic features.  Mondey soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick, have a soil reaction which is neutral or slightly acid in the A and Bt horizons, and are formed in sandstone.  Shar soils are moderately deep to bedrock.  Streek is moderately well drained and have carbonates below 40 inches."

Diffin and Yawkey soils are on north-facing footslopes below basalt cliffs, are clayey-skeletal, and have an abrupt increase in clay within the surface horizons.  Top soils are found on hillsides at slightly higher elevations and have a base saturation of less than 75 percent (ultic) and lack secondary carbonates.  Tub soils are found at lower elevations and are mesic."
