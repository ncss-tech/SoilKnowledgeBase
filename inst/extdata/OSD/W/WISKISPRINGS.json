  "OVERVIEW": "The Wiskisprings series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium.  They are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the average annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
