Alder, Bacbuster, Billman, Darret, and Mishakal are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Charo, Microy and Pino soils are moderately deep to a lithic contact. Bigbear, Durstan and Roaringlion soils are very deep. Turkeysprings soils are inactive."

The soils formed in fine textured material weathered from limestone and calcareous sandstone or shale.  The climate is subhumid continental.  At the type location the mean annual temperature is less than 47 degrees F. and the average precipitation is about 20 inches."
