  "OVERVIEW": "The Warneke series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum, slope alluvium or colluvium weathered from limestone.  These soils are on hills, escarpments, ridges, mountains, and bedrock-floored plains.  Slopes are 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
