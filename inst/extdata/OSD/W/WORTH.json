  "OVERVIEW": "The Worth series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loamy till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. A fragipan is present in the lower part of the subsoil. Saturated hydraulic conductivity in the mineral soil is moderately high or high above the fragipan and low to moderately high in the fragipan and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 1476 mm and mean annual temperature is 6 degrees C.",
