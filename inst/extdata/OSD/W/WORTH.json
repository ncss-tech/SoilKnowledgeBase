Rock fragments range from 1 to 40 percent by volume above the fragipan and from 20 to 70 percent in the fragipan and substratum.\nMost pedons have an O horizon. It has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. It is highly, moderately or slightly decomposed (fibric, hemic or sapric). Structure is granular or massive. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from ultra acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an A or Ap horizon. It has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Structure is weak or moderate granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction is extremely acid through slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bh and Bhs horizons have hues of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is subangular blocky or granular, or it is massive. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, with value or chroma of 4 or more. Texture is loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is granular or subangular blocky. Consistence is friable or very friable. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have an E' horizon. The texture is loamy sand to loam in the fine-earth fraction, and is perceptibly lighter in texture and higher in color value than Bx horizon. Some pedons have a B/E or BE horizon above the Bx horizon. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sandy loam or loam. It has coarse or very coarse prismatic structure or the horizon is massive. Prisms part to weak coarse block or platy structure, or are massive. Consistence is firm to extremely firm and brittle. Clay linings are in most pores, but do not coat prism faces. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction ranges from loam to loamy fine sand. Structure is platy or it is massive. Consistence is friable to very firm. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have carbonates below a depth of 122 cm."

These soils formed in till derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale, which may have a thin silty mantle of eolian material. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 to 1727 mm, mean annual temperature is 1 to 11 degrees C., and mean annual frost-free days range from 90 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 305 to 610 meters above sea level."

These MLRA's are retained until surveys are updated to remove the Worth series.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n(1) Ochric Epipedon - the zone from 6 to 8 cm (E horizon).\n(2) Spodic horizon - the zone from 8 to 53 cm (Bh, Bhs1, and Bhs2 horizons).\n(3) Fragipan - the zone from 66 to 127 cm (Bx1 and Bx2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon #09NY049024\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
