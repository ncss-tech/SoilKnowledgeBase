  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically ranges from 30 to 48 inches.  The solum commonly penetrates the loamy sand or sand for a few inches.  Depth to sandy material typically is 30 to 40 inches but in some pedons is as shallow as 24 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizons have hue of chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon is dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) or brown (10YR 4/3).\nThe BE and Bt horizons have value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  They are silty clay loam averaging between 28 and 32 percent clay.\nThe BC horizon typically is loam, but the range includes sandy loam. The 2E, 2E and Bt horizons have value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  The 2E and Bt horizon is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Some pedons do not have lamellae in lower horizons and have a 2C horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Kegonsa series.  Similar soils in other families are the Downs, Sattre, Tell, Waukee, and Waukegan series.  Kegonsa soils have calcareous sand and gravel 2C horizons at depths of about 30 inches.  Downs soils lack contrasting textures within depths of 40 inches.  Tell soils have thinner or lighter colored A or Ap horizon or both.  Sattre and Waukee soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy- skeletal and, in addition, the Waukee soils have mollic epipedons.  Waukegan soils have mollic epipedons and lack argillic horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whittier soils are on nearly level or gently sloping stream terraces and on gently to strongly sloping side slopes in the uplands where the loess layer is thin over sand.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 14 percent.  The Whittier soils formed in about 2 to 3 feet of leached, silty sediments and sandy alluvium.  Mean annual temperature is about 45 to 51 degrees F; mean annual precipitation ranges from 31 to 34 inches."

Tell and Waukegan soils are on similar landscape positions, and Atterberry soils are on more nearly level positions.  Atterberry soils have lower chroma in the upper part of the B horizon and lack the sand content in the lower solum."
