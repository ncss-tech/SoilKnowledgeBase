Cadiz soils have rock fragments within the series control section. Inton soils have a matrix with a hue yellower than 10YR within 76 centimeters (30 inches) of the surface. Iona soils have carbonates within a depth to 200 centimeters. Redbud soils have a lithologic discontinuity (lacustrine deposits) in the lower part of the series control section. Uniontown soils have calcium carbonate concretions in the lower part of the series control section."
