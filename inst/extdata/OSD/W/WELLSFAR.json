    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 39 to 43 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature is 42 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The upper 7 to 14 inches has an estimated bulk density of 1.10 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 3 to 8 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.\nThe Bw1 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry and moist.  It has 15 to 30 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bw2 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly coarse sandy loam.  It has 35 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and is very gravelly or very cobbly.  It has 35 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 20 percent cobbles.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from granitic rock with a component of volcanic ash in the upper part.  Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 4,900 to 6,200 feet.   The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 35 inches.  Average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22  degrees F.; Average July temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F.; and the average annual air temperature is about 35 to 40 degrees F.  The frost free season is 60 to 85 days."
