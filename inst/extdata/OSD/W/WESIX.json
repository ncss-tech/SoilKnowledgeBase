  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 55 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature ranges from 64 to 68 degrees F.  Bedrock is at a depth of 7 to 20 inches.  Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 15 to 27 percent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent, including the content in limestone fragments less than 20 mm in diameter, averages 40 to 80 percent in the C horizon and in the particle-size control section.  It ranges down to about 25 percent in the A horizon.  Rock fragment content in the particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent, but may range up to 70 to 90 percent in some pedons.  Rock fragments include channers and subrounded pebbles and cobbles.  The moisture control section in most years is dry in some part more than one-half the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F., but in most years it is moist in some part more than 60 consecutive days in April through June.  It is usually moist in some part in the spring, summer, and early fall.  The moisture control section in most years is dry in some part for less than 60 cumulative days during the 90 days following the winter solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is commonly very channery loam or very gravelly loam."
