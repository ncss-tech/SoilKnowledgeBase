  "REVDATE": "10/2003",
  "STATES": "AL,LA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Watsonia series consists of shallow, well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey sediments overlying chalk.  They are on convex ridgetops and side slopes on uplands of the Alabama, Mississippi, and Arkansas Blackland Prairie major land resource area.  Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 53 inches.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to chalk bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Texture is clay or silty clay.\nThe upper part of the Bss horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8; or it has no dominant matrix color and is mottled in shades of red, brown, and olive.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Commonly, the lower part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8; but also includes the same range in color as the upper part.  Mottles, if present, are in shades of red, olive, or brown.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Content of soft masses and/or concretions of calcium carbonate ranges from none to common.  Texture of the Bss horizon is clay or silty clay.\nA thin Bw horizon is present in some pedons.  It has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It has the same range in texture and reaction as the upper part of the Bss horizon.\nThe 2Cr horizon is chalk bedrock.  It can be cut with hand tools and is rippable by light machinery.  It is strongly or violently effervescent and reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  These soils developed in thin layers of clayey sediments overlying chalk.  The climate is warm and humid.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 56 inches."

Binnsville soils are on smoother positions and have a mollic epipedon.  Demopolis soils are on similar positions as Watsonia and are loamy-skeletal.  Faunsdale and Vaiden soils are on smoother positions and are very deep to chalk bedrock.  Oktibbeha soils are on similar positions as Watsonia and are very deep to chalk bedrock.  Sumter soils are on smoother positions and are moderately deep to chalk bedrock and are calcareous to the surface."
