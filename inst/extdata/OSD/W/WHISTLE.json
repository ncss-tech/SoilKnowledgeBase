These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 48 to 52 degrees F.  Coarse fragments in the control section average from 35 to 85 percent and consist of gravel and some cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  Some pedons have a thin A2 horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6 moist and dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  Texture is very gravelly loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 and 4 moist or dry.  Texture is very gravelly, extremely gravelly, or very cobbly sandy loam."

They formed in colluvium from glacial till and argillite, serpentine or basalt with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part.  Average annual precipitation is 18 to 30 inches.  The estimated average January temperature is about 36 degrees F, the estimated July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.
