  "OVERVIEW": "The Whistle series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium from bedrock and glacial till with an admixture of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on glacially modified hills.  Slopes are 15 to 90 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist, but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 48 to 52 degrees F.  Coarse fragments in the control section average from 35 to 85 percent and consist of gravel and some cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4 moist and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  Some pedons have a thin A2 horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 6 moist and dry, and chroma of 4 to 6 moist and dry.  Texture is very gravelly loam, very gravelly fine sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and dry, and chroma of 2 and 4 moist or dry.  Texture is very gravelly, extremely gravelly, or very cobbly sandy loam."
