  "OVERVIEW": "The Wisheylu series is a member of a fine-loamy, mixed, thermic family of Ultic Haploxeralfs.  The soils have grayish brown loam A horizons, dark brown clay loam upper Bt horizons, which become grayish brown sandy clay loam with depth, overlying strongly weathered basic igneous rock.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils have ochric epipedons (less than 1% organic matter in upper 10 inches), argillic horizons with base saturation of less than 75 percent in all parts.  The soils are usually moist but dry for 60 consecutive days in 7 to 20 inch section.  Mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 72 degrees F.  Mineralogy is mixed.  The solum is 21 to 41 inches thick to strongly weathered basic igneous rock.\nThe texture of the A horizons range from loam to sandy loam; in color from brown or dark brown to grayish brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3, 5/2) dry, and from dark brown or very dark brown to very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/3, 2/2, 3/2) moist; in reaction from neutral to slightly acid.  Surface structure is usually granular unless compacted by the trampling of grazing animals.\nThe Bt horizons are distinctive for their dull colors of dark brown to dark grayish brown (10YR 4/3, 4/2; 7.5YR 4/2).  When dry the B21t may brighten to a brown or yellowish brown (10YR and 7.5YR hues), while the lower part of the B2t has a yellower hue (2.5Y 5/2).  The moist B21t colors are generally dark, ranging from very dark grayish brown to dark reddish brown (10YR 3/2, 3/3; 2.5Y 3/2; 5YR 3/2).  The Bt textures are clay loam and sandy clay loam.  The structure is moderately coarse angular blocky to weakly prismatic.  The lower subsoil is often massive and extremely hard and firm.  The color of the lower subsoil and of the weathered parent rock indicates that slow subsurface seepage may have played a part in the development of this soil."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include in the same family the Auberry, Butte, Churn, Coombs and Sierra series.  The Auberry soils are well drained, have brown to pale brown Bt horizons overlying strongly weathered granitic bedrock.  The Butte soils have white B2t horizons and are underlain by rhyolitic tuff.  The Churn and Coombs soils developed in alluvium, have Bt horizons overlying gravelly substratum.  The Sierra soils have reddish brown Bt horizons overlying granitic bedrock.  Similar soils in the mollic subgroup are Cajalco, Coarsegold and Sobrante.  The Tretten soils with mollic epipedons are also similar."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wisheylu soils occur on strongly rolling to very steep uplands underlain by intrusive basic igneous rock.  They occur at elevations of 1,000 to 2,500 feet, in a subhumid mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 20 to 25 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees to 61 degrees F., average January temperature about 43 degrees F., and average July temperature about 77 degrees F.   Frost-free season averages about 180 to 200 days."

The Auberry, Ahwahnee, and Tollhouse soils are underlain by granitic bedrock; Coarsegold soils are underlain by metasedimentary bedrock.  Tretten soils have darker A horizons higher in organic matter."
