  "REVDATE": "08/2012",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wabun series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils on lake plains. These soils formed in sandy outwash and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",

Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy outwash and moderately low in the lacustrine deposits. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy outwash and slow in the lacustrine deposit."
