The Wabun soils formed in sandy outwash and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 762 mm (28 to 30 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 6.1 to 7.2 degrees C (43 to 45 degrees F)."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the upper sandy outwash and moderately low in the lacustrine deposits. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy outwash and slow in the lacustrine deposit."
