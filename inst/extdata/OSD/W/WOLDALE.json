  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Woldale series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. Woldale soils are in depressional and low lying areas on piedmont slopes grading from mountain foot slopes to basin floors. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 52 degrees F. These soils are saturated with water at some period during the year, if not artificially drained. Water tables are a combination of natural conditions and artificially induced high water due to irrigation. Depth to aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less and redox concentrations is 12 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay 5 to 20 percent rock fragments. Depth to the 2BC horizon ranges from 28 to 40 inches. Depth to the 2C horizon is 40 inches or more. The mollic epipedon is 13 to 23 inches thick. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 0 dry or moist.\nThe BA horizon has value of 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 0 dry or moist.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR , value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe 2BCg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry or moist. Texture is very cobbly clay or very gravelly clay and has 25 to 35 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles. Redox concentrations and segregations range from common to many and distinct to prominent.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist. Texture is extremely cobbly clay loam, very cobbly clay loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam and has 30 to 45 percent gravel and 20 to 30 percent cobbles.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Woldale soils are on fan aprons and fan skirts that typically follow swales and are elongated down the piedmont slope. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. They formed in coalescing alluvial fan deposits issuing from gullies and inset fans, which merge with the basin floor along their mutual lower boundaries. Elevations are 1,500 to 2,000 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. The average January temperature is about 25 degrees F. and  the average July temperature is about 69 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 48 to 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 130 to 150 days."

Opnish soils have carbonates, a vitrandic influence in the surface horizon and are on alluvial fans.  Tanaha soils are moderately deep to a duripan and are on flood plains."
