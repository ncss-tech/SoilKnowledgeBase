  "OVERVIEW": "The Woonsocket series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy sediments on glacial outwash plains.  Permeability is moderate in the solum and moderately rapid or rapid in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Blendon and Carthage soils are coarse-loamy, and Doger soils are sandy.  Hand soils lack argillic horizons and contain less sand.  Elsmere and Fedora soils are in swales and depressions.  Elsmere soils are sandy, and Fedora soils have calcic horizons.  Whitelake soils are on similar parts of the landscape and do not have a glossic horizon."
