Depth to carbonates ranges from 14 to 35 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of l0YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but, is loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is sandy clay loam but includes sandy loam and fine sandy loam.  It ranges from l8 to 35 percent clay and from 55 to 80 percent fine sand or coarser.  Dark colored tongues of A horizon extend through the Btn horizon in some pedons.  Small patches of uncoated sand grains are on vertical cleavage planes and in root channels in the upper part of the Btn horizon in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a Btkn horizon up to 6 inches thick.  When present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It has few to many, faint or distinct redox features.  It typically has few or common, fine or medium accumulations of carbonates.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk and C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand or fine sand.  In addition, textures of sand are allowed in the C horizon.  The Bk and C horizons have few to many, faint or distinct redox features.  They are slightly or moderately alkaline.  The Bk horizon has few to many, fine to coarse accumulations of carbonates.  Some pedons have thin strata of loam, silt loam, and fine sandy loam between depths of 40 and 80 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Woonsocket soils are level to gently sloping on glacial outwash plains.  Surfaces are plane or concave.  Slope gradients typically are less than 3 percent but range from 0 to 6 percent.  The soils formed in loamy glacial outwash sediments.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 17 to 24 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Artesian, Blendon, Carthage, Doger, Durrstein, Elsmere, Fedora, Hand and Whitelake soils.  Artesian and Durrstein soils have fine textured control sections and are on lower parts of the landscape.  Blendon, Carthage, Doger, and Hand soils are on higher parts of the landscape.  Blendon and Carthage soils are coarse-loamy, and Doger soils are sandy.  Hand soils lack argillic horizons and contain less sand.  Elsmere and Fedora soils are in swales and depressions.  Elsmere soils are sandy, and Fedora soils have calcic horizons.  Whitelake soils are on similar parts of the landscape and do not have a glossic horizon."
