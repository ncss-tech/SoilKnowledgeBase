  "OVERVIEW": "The Wells series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from noncalcareous sandstones and sandy shales modified by thin deposits of colluvium from sandstone and loess.  Wells soils are on hillslopes on uplands in the Central Kansas Sandstone Hills, MLRA 74.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 760 millimeters (30 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F).",

Updated climate information.  Added elevation to typical pedon. Added clay content, sand content, and rock fragments in RIC. Added BA ranges. Added chroma of 8 to range for Bt.  Changed color values and added calcium carbonate equivalent (deleted concretions) for C. Added elevation, precipitation pattern, and frost free days to geomorphic setting. Deleted thornwaite PE index. Updated geographically associated soils. Added LRR and MLRA to Distribution and Extent. Added statement on depth to bedrock in remarks section. Added sample number that supports CEC activity class.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nA pedon was sampled from the same general area as the typical pedon.  KSSL lab pedon no. 79P0320 (pedon 79KS143001)."
