  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to limestone or hard, fine grained calcareous sandstone is typically 30 to 36 inches but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon typically includes the upper part of the argillic horizon.  Depth to free carbonates is typically 15 to 30 inches, but some pedons are calcareous at or near the surface due to recharge.  The mean annual soil temperature is 38 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 50 to 58 degrees F.  EC is less than 2 mmhos throughout the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent fine angular gravel.  Reaction is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay loam or silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay, and more than 15 but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent fine angular gravel.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline in the upper part and may range to moderately alkaline in the lower part when free carbonates are present.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is loam, clay loam, gravelly loam, or gravelly clay loam.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent fine angular gravel.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 6 to 15 percent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline."

The Amsden, Croftshaw, Dewville, Gelkie, Leavitt, Monaberg, Morset, Oro Fino, Wellsville, and Youga soils are very deep.  The Cific, Hooligan, Inchau, Lymanson, Rainbolt, Tripit, and Zade soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Coldspring soils have a lithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Highrye soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches. Kezar soils formed in granitic materials and have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand in the Bt horizon.  Barbarela and Lucky soils are noncalcareous throughout.  Miracle soils have hue of 5YR through 2.5YR in the Bt horizon and no pedogenetic Bk horizon.  Passcreek soils are 10 to 19 inches to horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Woosley soils are on mountain footslopes, toeslopes, and backslopes.  These soils formed in calcareous residuum, alluvial and colluvial slopewash weathered from limestone or calcareous fine-grained sandstone.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 6,500 to 9,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and ranges from 15 to about 25 inches of which about half falls as snow or rain in April, May, and June.  The mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F. and ranges from 33 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to be about 45 to 85 days, but frost can occur at any time at higher elevations."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Decross, Nathrop, and Starman soils.  Decross soils are deep with overthickened mollic epipedons. They occur in depressional or snowpack areas.  Nathrop soils are skeletal and occur near the areas of rock outcrop and along drainages.  The Starman soils are shallow or very shallow and occur on slope shoulders near rock outcrop."
