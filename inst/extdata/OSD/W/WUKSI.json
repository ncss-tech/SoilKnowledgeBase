The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature is 52 to 59 degrees F.  without an O horizon and 40 to 47 degrees F. with an O horizon, and the mean winter soil temperature is 32 to 35 degrees F.  The solum is 14 to 35 inches thick.  Depth to basalt bedrock is 60 inches or more.  Depth to the buried soils is 40 to more than 60 inches.  The control section consists mostly of irregular shaped hard scoriaceous lava basalt rock fragments with the voids filled with ash.  The solum has 70 to 100 percent volcanic glass and glass coated aggregates, 25 to 50 percent phosphate retention, 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron, 15-bar moisture of 3 to 12 percent on both moist and dry samples, and moist bulk density of 0.70 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter.  It has 0 to 5 percent clay by field estimate.\nSome pedons lack an O horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.
