  "REVDATE": "06/2015",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Walford series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on interfluves or ridgetops on dissected till plains and treads and risers on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 87 centimeters (34 inches).",
