  "OVERVIEW": "The Wheaton series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability.  They formed in residuum that has been graded from the original weathering of schist and gneiss in the Piedmont Plateau.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.",

Rock fragments, mostly of hard quartzite or flat schist, range from 2 to 15 percent throughout.  The fine-earth fraction has greater than 50 percent silt and very fine sand.  Soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  They are silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction."
