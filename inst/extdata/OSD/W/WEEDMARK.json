  "OVERVIEW": "The Weedmark series consists of moderately deep and deep well drained Gray-Brown Podsolic soils formed in residuum from gneiss schist, granite end other similar bedrock.  Upper horizons may be derived partially or wholly from loess.  They occur on undulating to steep upland under a forest, forb and grass cover.  They have an A1, Bt and R horizon sequence.  The A1 horizon is dark grayish brown, weak blocky and friable.  The Bt is brown to reddish brown in color, prismatic-blocky, firm and moderately fine to fine textured.  The related Brownlee soils contain 3-4 percent organic matter in the A1 with C:N ratio of less than 14.5, and are medium to slightly acid throughout the solum.  The Johnson soils are slightly acid throughout the solum and have chromas of 6 in the lower Bt.  The Lochsa soils lack a Bt, have a coarse sandy loam control section and have weak structure in the B horizon.  The Sutler soils lack a Bt and have a moderately coarse to medium control section.  The Weedmark series is at elevations of 2,800 to 3,500 feet in a humid, continental climate.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 47 to 50 degrees F., and the mean summer air temperature is 60 to 66 degrees F.  The average frost-free period ranges from 100 to 130 days.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches and includes 5 to 6 feet of snowfall.  July-August is distinctly the driest period.  The series occupies 10 to 30 square miles or more and is important for forestry, alfalfa and grass.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Loam is the dominant type, but silt loam may be recognized.  Cobbly, stony, and eroded phases exist.  An 01 horizon less than about 1.5 inches thick is present where the surface has not been disturbed. The A1 or Ap ranges in color value from 4 to 5 when dry and 2 to 3 when moist, in chroma from 1.8 to 2.5, and in hue from 1Y to 8YR.  The A2 and B1t may have some to distinct, bleached silt and very fine sand coatings on the peds but not enough for a distinct A2.  The A1 contains 4-7 percent of organic matter, which has a C/N ratio of 16-19.  The B2t ranges in hue from 8YR to 5YR and in chroma from 3.5 to 5.5. The B2t ranges from clay loam to sandy clay or sandy clay loam.  In many places the soil contains up to 30 percent of small angular quartz fragments.  The A1 ranges in pH from about 5.2 to 6.0, the B2t from 5.2 to 5.6 and the R from 5.3 to 6.0.  The depth to somewhat or distinctly consolidated bedrock ranges from 20 to 55 inches, but the B-R boundary ranges from abrupt to diffuse."
