  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Watne series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium derived from limestone or argillite.  These soils are on alluvial fans, interfluves, knolls and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
