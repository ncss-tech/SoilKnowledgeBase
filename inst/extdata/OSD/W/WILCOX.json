  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to shale ranges from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid, except in areas that have been limed.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe Bt or Btss horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8; or it has no dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of brown, red, and gray.  Redox depletions in shades of gray, and redox accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and red range from few to many.  Some pedons have few to common fragments of ironstone.  Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid. Texture is clay.\nThe Bss horizon commonly has no dominant matrix color and is multicolored in shades of gray, brown, yellow, olive, and red.  In some pedons, the Bss horizon has a gray matrix with few to many redox accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and red.  Fragments of shale and ironstone range from none to common.  Reaction commonly ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid, but includes moderately acid in the lower part of some pedons.  Texture is clay or silty clay.\nTransition horizons, such as BC, CB, B/C, or C/B, occur in some pedons.  They have similar ranges in properties as the master horizon from which they are derived.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has a gray matrix with few to many redox accumulations in shades of brown, yellow, and red.  The gray colors are relic redoximorphic features.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid.  Texture is clay or silty clay.\nThe Cr horizon is shale or clayey shale.  It has platy or conchoidal rock structure and is restrictive to root growth.  It can be cut with hand tools and is rippable by machinery.  Reaction commonly ranges from ultra-acid to strongly acid, but strata of alkaline shale are included."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the LaCerda, Oktibbeha, Redco and Suggsville series in the same family.  LaCerda and Redco soils are in the Western Coastal Plain (MLRA 133B) Major Land Resource Area.  Oktibbeha soils are moderately well drained and are underlain by calcareous clays or chalk.  Suggsville soils are moderately deep to limestone bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wilcox soils are in uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  Slopes commonly range from 1 to 15 percent, but slopes of up to 35 percent are included.  These soils formed in clayey sediments and shale of the Porters Creek Formation.  The average annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 56 inches."
