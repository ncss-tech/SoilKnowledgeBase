The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F. The soil is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizons have value of 4 to 7 dry, 2 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4. In some pedons, the surface 10 inches has average value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 to 7 moist. These horizons have weak granular or subangular blocky structure or it is single grained.\nThe C horizons have value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is mostly loamy sand, and loamy fine sand, and has strata of sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. It has subangular blocky structure or it is massive. This horizon has few fine to many or very fine redox concentrations or depletions with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist.\n2Cg horizon (present in some pedons) - is stratified heavy silt loam to sand and is at depths of 40 inches or more. It has few medium to common\nfine or medium redox features."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon (assumed organic carbon content not met for this pedon) from the surface to 28 inches and a particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches that is assumed to have an irregular decrease in organic carbon based on texture and soil color.\nThe Wethey series and the type location are no longer recognized in Spokane County as investigated during the Spokane County update (extensive revision) mainly due to variability in the alluvium and an assumed frigid soil temperature regime. For these reasons, the type location was moved to Stevens County in 03/2012. The majority of the Wethey soils mapped in the Spokane update (extensive revision) were correlated to higher taxa components with a frigid soil temperature regime.\nMLRA 43A, 44A update notes - further investigation is needed to determine the soil temperature regime (mesic vs frigid) given the geographic extent and vegetation listed on the OSD of Wethey map units in Stevens County."
