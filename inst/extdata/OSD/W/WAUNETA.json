  "OVERVIEW": "The Wauneta series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium. Wauneta soils are on relict terraces and washes. Slopes range from 0 to 10 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 millimeters) and occurs as thunderstorms during July to September and as gentle rains and snowfall during December and January. The mean annual air temperature is 54 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit (12.2 to 13.9 degrees Celsius). The frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."
