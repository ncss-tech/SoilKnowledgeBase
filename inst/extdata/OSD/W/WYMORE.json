  "OVERVIEW": "The Wymore series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess. These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 0 to 9 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",

Other pedons are on pg. 226 to 231 or at this site:\nhttp://ssldata.sc.egov.usda.gov/rptExecute.asp?p=2289&r=1&submit1=Get+Report\nWymore was modified 12/12/2003 to remove slopes greater than 9 percent and to clarify depths to pedisediment and glacial till.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
