  "OVERVIEW": "The Wareagle series consists of very deep, well drained soils with moderate permeability that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from rhyolite and welded rhyolitic tuff.  Wareagle soils are on sideslopes and footslopes of mountains.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 690 mm and average annual temperature is about 2.6 degrees C.",

Antrobus soils are calcareous throughout and are moderately alkaline.  Basinpeak soils lack Bw horizons and have an average annual soil temperature of 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C.  Decram, Foxmount, Grafen, Krackle, Parachute, Rockabin, and Supervisor soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to bedrock.  Broad Canyon and Tineman soils have lithologic discontinuities to coarse textures above 100 cm.  Fairydell, Farlow, Greyback, Middlehill, Silvercliff, Teemat, and Tiban soils are calcareous above 100 cm.  Farlow, Grafen, Hadran, Midelight, Midfork, and Sup soils lack Bw horizons.  Gaia soils lack Bw horizons and have lamellae in the C horizon.  Grafen, Greyback, Handran, Klug, Maurice, Middlehill, Sebud, Tiban, and Tineman lack organic horizons. Kamack and McCort soils have 7.5YR or 5YR hues in the B horizon and average annual soil temperature of 42 to 45 degrees F.  Lag soils are neutral throughout.  Sebud soils have average annual soil temperature of 45 to 47 degrees F. and have predominantly stones and boulders in the control section.  Sup soils have an average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F.  Thornburgh soils are mildly alkaline in the lower part of the control section.  Timmercrek soils have lamellae in the C horizon and are moist intermittently in summer and fall due to convection storms."
