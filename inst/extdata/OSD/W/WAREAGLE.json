Antrobus soils are calcareous throughout and are moderately alkaline.  Basinpeak soils lack Bw horizons and have an average annual soil temperature of 6.1 to 8.3 degrees C.  Decram, Foxmount, Grafen, Krackle, Parachute, Rockabin, and Supervisor soils are 50 to 100 cm deep to bedrock.  Broad Canyon and Tineman soils have lithologic discontinuities to coarse textures above 100 cm.  Fairydell, Farlow, Greyback, Middlehill, Silvercliff, Teemat, and Tiban soils are calcareous above 100 cm.  Farlow, Grafen, Hadran, Midelight, Midfork, and Sup soils lack Bw horizons.  Gaia soils lack Bw horizons and have lamellae in the C horizon.  Grafen, Greyback, Handran, Klug, Maurice, Middlehill, Sebud, Tiban, and Tineman lack organic horizons. Kamack and McCort soils have 7.5YR or 5YR hues in the B horizon and average annual soil temperature of 42 to 45 degrees F.  Lag soils are neutral throughout.  Sebud soils have average annual soil temperature of 45 to 47 degrees F. and have predominantly stones and boulders in the control section.  Sup soils have an average annual soil temperature of 44 to 47 degrees F.  Thornburgh soils are mildly alkaline in the lower part of the control section.  Timmercrek soils have lamellae in the C horizon and are moist intermittently in summer and fall due to convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wareagle soils are moderately steep and steep on sideslopes and footslopes of mountains at elevations of 1,540 to 2,505 meters.  Slopes range from 15 to 50 percent.  These soils formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from rhyolite and welded rhyolitic tuff.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and warm and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 560 to 810 mm, most of which is snow, and average annual temperature ranges from 1.1 to 3.8 degrees C.  Frost-free period is less than 60 days."
