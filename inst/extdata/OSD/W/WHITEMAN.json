  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock (lithic contact) ranges from 10 to 18 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 36 to 42 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature above the lithic contact is 54 to 58 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4.  It has weak or moderate, fine granular structure or thin or very thin platy structure.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.  It has 0 to 70 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is very cobbly or extremely cobbly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly clay loam, sandy clay loam or silty clay loam and has 35 to 90 percent rock fragments but averages 50 to 70 percent.  Thin horizons in some pedons are free of rock fragments.  The Bt horizon has thin, few to continuous clay films.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  In some pedons thin C horizons occur between the Bt horizons and the lithic contact."

Slope gradients range from 1 to 70 percent, usually 1 to 30 percent.  The soils formed in shallow residuum from limestone.  The climate is moist subhumid.  The average annual precipitation is 19 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 36 to 42 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F. and the freeze-free period is 60 to 75 days."
