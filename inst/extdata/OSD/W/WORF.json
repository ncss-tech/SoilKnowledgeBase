  "OVERVIEW": "The Worf series consists of well drained soils that are very shallow or shallow to bedrock.  They formed in residuum and colluvial slopewash weathered from sedimentary rock.  Worf soils are on upland hills and ridges and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to calcareous material ranges from 4 to 10 inches; depth to bedrock ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  The soil is 90 to 100 percent base saturated.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent but are typically less than 5 percent and are mostly soft shale fragments.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, and is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loamy sand, loam, or fine sandy loam. Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically light clay loam but may be loam or sandy clay loam with clay ranging from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 20 to 55 percent, and sand from 15 to 50 percent with  15 to 35 percent being fine sand or coarser.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk or Btk horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 12 percent.  Texture is loam or fine sandy loam in the Bk and clay loam or sandy clay loam in the Btk. Reaction is slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline."

These soils formed in calcareous materials weathered from sedimentary bedrock.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 inches with over half of the annual precipitation falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October.  Precipitation ranges from 10 to 17 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free season is about 105 to 130 days."
