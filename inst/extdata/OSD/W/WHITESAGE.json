(Bk2 through Bk5 horizons)\nOchric epipedon:  The zone from 0 to 3 inches.  (A horizon)\nCalcic horizon: The zone from 10 to 40 inches.  (Bk2 through Bk5 horizons).\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nThe fine-loamy particle size classification is a tentative placement.  Further investigation of these landforms and sediments would be necessary to understand the relative percentages of silicate and carbonate sized clays for a definitive placement.\nThe classification was changed from Haplocalcidic Ustochrepts to frigid Aridic Calciustepts 12/98.\nLast updated by the state: 8/99.\nTaxonomic version:  Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
