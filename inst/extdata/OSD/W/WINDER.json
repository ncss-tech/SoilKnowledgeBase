  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 22 to 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline throughout.  In some areas, pyrites are in the argillic horizon and when the soil is drained sulfates are released and the reaction decreases to extremely acid or ultra acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1; or it is neutral with value of 2 to 4.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Streaks and areas of organic accumulations and depletions in shades of black to gray range from few to common.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe B/A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Redoximorphic features in shades of yellow, brown, or gray range from few to common.  Average clay content is 18 to 25 percent, but ranges to 35 percent.  Texture of the B part ranges from sandy loam to sandy clay loam.  Texture of the A part is sand or loamy sand extending vertically into the horizon from the E horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.  Masses of iron accumulations in shades of yellow and brown range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam to sandy clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8; or there is no dominant color and it is multicolored in shades of yellow, brown, and gray.  Fragments of hard calcium carbonate nodules or shell range from none to common.  Texture is sandy loam or sandy clay loam."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winder soils are on broad, low flats and depressed areas in the Lower Coastal Plain.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  They formed in a thin bed of loamy marine materials over marl.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual rainfall ranges from 50 to 60 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from 72 to 74 degrees F."

Bradenton soils are on similar positions but have coarse-loamy control sections.  The very poorly drained Canova and Tequesta soils are on similar to lower positions and have histic epipedons.  In addition, Tequesta soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  The very poorly drained Chobee and Manatee soils are on similar and/or lower positions and are Mollisols.  In addition, Manatee soils have less clay in the control section.  The very poorly drained and poorly drained EauGallie, Immokalee, Myakka, Oldsmar, and Wabasso soils are on similar and/or lower positions and have spodic horizons.  The very poorly drained and poorly drained Holopaw and Malabar soils are on similar to lower positions and have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  Parkwood soils have a mollic epipedon and have coarse-loamy subsoils.  The very poorly drained or poorly drained Pineda and Riviera soils are on similar positions and have sandy surface sand subsurface layers 20 to 40 inches in thickness.  The very poorly drained Pompano soils are on similar to lower positions and are sandy throughout."
