  "OVERVIEW": "The Winterset series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loess. These soils are on interfluves on dissected till plains and treads on stream terraces in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.",

The linear extensibility is 6.04 centimeters between the surface and a depth of 100 centimeters. The classification of one the most common associates, Macksburg series, was recently changed to fine, smectitic, mesic Aquertic Argiudolls, based on linear extensibility.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, twelfth edition, 2014."
