The linear extensibility is 6.04 centimeters between the surface and a depth of 100 centimeters. The classification of one the most common associates, Macksburg series, was recently changed to fine, smectitic, mesic Aquertic Argiudolls, based on linear extensibility.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, twelfth edition, 2014.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory data--Iowa State University, Ames Iowa\nLaboratory data--Kellogg Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska user pedon ID numbers 1961IA121003, 1961IA121002, 1982MO195006m.\nIn Iowa, the native vegetative cover is a herbaceous wetland community commonly inhabited with Bluejoint Grasses, Fowl Bluegrasses, Green Muhlies, Fox Sedges, Field Sedges, Dudleys Rushes, Torreys Rushes, Swamp Milkweeds, False Sneezeweeds, False Asters, New England Asters, White Panicled Asters, and Wild Mints.
