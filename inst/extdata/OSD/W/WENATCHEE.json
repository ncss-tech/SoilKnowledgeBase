  "OVERVIEW": "The Wenatchee series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in old alluvium mixed with loess and small amounts of volcanic ash. Wenatchee soils are on terraces and fans and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon is 8 to 18 inches thick.  Content of coarse fragments in the particle-size control section is 5 to 15 percent.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.  The A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist.  Content of coarse fragments is 5 to 15 percent and clay content is 25 to 35 percent.  Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 5 dry, 2 to 5 moist.  Content of coarse fragments is 5 to 15 percent.  Some pedons have a coarse sand, sand, or loamy sand 2C horizon."

Cowiche soils have 0 to 5 percent rock fragment in the particle-size control section and formed in loess and residuum in the uplands.  Margerum soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments, dominantly pumice in the particle-size control section.  Orr soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Ralls soils have 15 to 35 percent basalt fragments in the particle-size control section.  Springmeyer soils are friable in the Bt horizon and have 5 to 35 rock fragments in the particle-size control section."
