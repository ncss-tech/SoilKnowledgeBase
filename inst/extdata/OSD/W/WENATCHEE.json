The mollic epipedon is 8 to 18 inches thick.  Content of coarse fragments in the particle-size control section is 5 to 15 percent.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline throughout.  The A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist.  Content of coarse fragments is 5 to 15 percent and clay content is 25 to 35 percent.  Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 to 5 dry, 2 to 5 moist.  Content of coarse fragments is 5 to 15 percent.  Some pedons have a coarse sand, sand, or loamy sand 2C horizon."

Cowiche soils have 0 to 5 percent rock fragment in the particle-size control section and formed in loess and residuum in the uplands.  Margerum soils have 15 to 35 percent coarse fragments, dominantly pumice in the particle-size control section.  Orr soils have 18 to 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Ralls soils have 15 to 35 percent basalt fragments in the particle-size control section.  Springmeyer soils are friable in the Bt horizon and have 5 to 35 rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in old alluvium mixed with loess and volcanic ash.  They are in a climate with warm and dry summers and cold and moist winters.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 9 to 12 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 150 to 185 days."
