    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wabuska soils are on alluvial flats and lake plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed igneous and sedimentary rocks.  The alluvium has been modified by sodium precipitated from upward moving ground water. Elevations are 1,250 to 1,405 meters.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C.  The frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
