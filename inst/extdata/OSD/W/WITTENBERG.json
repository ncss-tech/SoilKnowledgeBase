The difference between mean summer and mean winter temperature is less than 9 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is moist in all parts for 275 to 300 days.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent gravel.  The soil is loam throughout and averages 20 to 27 percent clay.  Reaction is medium acid to very strongly acid throughout.  Base saturation is less than 20 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2 or 5/2 and moist color of 10YR 3/1, 3/2, 3/3; or 7.5YR 3/2.  Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or granular.  Consistence is soft or slightly hard.\nThe C horizon  has dry color of 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/3; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4 or 6/6.
