  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches in thickness.  Depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper sediment lacks rock fragments and the 2C may contain up to 10 percent rock fragments by volume where it is developed in till.  The upper sediment averages less than 18 percent noncarbonate clay and less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser.  The 2C horizon typically averages between 45 and 55 percent clay with extreme range of 35 to 80 percent.  The control section has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 20 to 45 percent with the higher values occurring in the Bk horizon.  The soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  Saline phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It has granular or subangular structure.  It has slight to strong effervescence.  Some pedons have an Ak horizon up to 6 inches thick.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4 and has redoximorphic features in some pedons.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nSome pedons have a C horizon up to 18 inches thick above the 2C horizon.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It lacks redoximorphic features in some pedons.  It is loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  It has slight or strong effervescence.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It typically is silty clay or clay, but heavy silty clay loam is in the range.  It is varved or stratified with very fine sand or fine sand in some pedons developed in lacustrine deposits.  It has slight or strong effervescence."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wheatville soils have plane or slightly convex slopes of 0 to 3 percent on lake plains.  They formed in a 20- to 40-inch mantle of silty calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments overlying clayey calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments or till.  These sediments are Late Wisconsinan in Age.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation of 18 to 24 inches.  The summers are short and warm, and the winters are long and cold.  Frost-free period ranges from 90 to 140 days.  Elevation ranges from 650 to 1200 feet."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately rapid in the upper part and slow or very slow in the lower part.  Runoff is negligible to low depending on slope.  A seasonal high apparent water table is at a depth of 1.5 to 3.5 feet at some time during the period of April to June in most years."
