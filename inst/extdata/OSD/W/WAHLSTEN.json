Rock fragment content averages 10 to 35 percent, by volume, in the control section.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Rock fragment content averages 5 to 25 percent by volume with 2 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones and 0 to 5 percent boulders.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  Rock fragment content averages 5 to 25 percent by volume with 2 to 15 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones and 0 to 5 percent boulders.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe 2Cd horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.  Rock fragment content averages 15 to 45 percent by volume with 10 to 35 percent gravel, 5 to 25 percent cobbles, 0 to 10 percent stones and 0 to 5 percent boulders.  Reaction is moderately acid to slightly acid.  Fractures occur in this horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wahlsten soils are on linear or convex surfaces of bedrock-controlled uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  They formed in a mantle of friable loamy material and dense glacial till over bedrock.  The till was deposited by the Rainy Lobe.  The bedrock is Precambrian igneous, metamorphic, or sedimentary rocks of the Canadian Shield.  Mean annual air temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 27 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 120.   Elevation above sea level ranges from 1400 to 1900 feet."

Eaglesnest and Eveleth soils do not have bedrock above a depth of 80 inches.  The well drained Insula soils are shallow to bedrock.  The well drained Quetico soils are very shallow to bedrock."
