  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wall series consists of very deep, well drained soils on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans or valley sideslopes. Slope gradients range from about 1 to 20 percent. The soils formed in alluvial fan sediments derived principally from sandstone. At the type location the average annual precipitation is about 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation during the spring and summer months. Mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 66 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to calcareous material ranges from 8 to 20 inches and thickness of solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches. The weighted average organic carbon content in the upper 15 inches ranges from .1 to .4 percent. The sand/clay ratio ranges from 4 to 18. The 10 to 40 inch control section is typically sandy loam but clay ranges from 5 to 18 percent, silt from 5 to 35 percent, and sand from 5 to 80 percent with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser and excluding any loamy sand from the above range. The sand is mainly fine and medium and there is less than 25 percent coarse and very coarse sand. Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent, but are typically less than 10 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 51 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 68 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is neutral or mildly alkaline (pH 7.0 to 7.8). The horizon is soft or slightly hard.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 10YR. It is moderately or strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6), and has 2 to about 8 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Koyen soils are moderately to strongly alkaline in the solum and has a significant component of volcanic ash and other pyroclastic material. Quima soils have 25 percent or more of coarse or very coarse sand in the 10 to 40 inch section. Unionville soils have bedrock within 40 inches of the surface and are strongly alkaline throughout."
