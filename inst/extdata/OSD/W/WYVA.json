  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyva series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  The Wyva soils are on mountains and hills.  Slopes are 15 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
