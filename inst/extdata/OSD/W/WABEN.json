  "OVERVIEW": "The Waben series consist of very deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in very cherty alluvium and colluvium.  These gently sloping to moderately steep soils are on narrow terraces, alluvial-colluvial fans and toe slopes of the Ozark Highlands.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches.",
