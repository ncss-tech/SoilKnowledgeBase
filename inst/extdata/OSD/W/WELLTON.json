  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wellton series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed stream and fan alluvium and eolian deposits.  Wellton soils are on fan terraces or relict basin floors and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 72 degrees F.",

Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches, which falls during summer thunderstorms and as gentle winter rains.  Mean January temperature is about 52 degrees F., and the average July temperature is about 92 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 260 to 325 days."
