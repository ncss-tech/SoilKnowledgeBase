    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wellton soils are on fan terraces or relict basin floors.  They have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in fan or stream alluvium from mixed sources and eolian deposits.  Elevations are 150 to 1,300 feet.  The climate is hot, arid continental.  Mean annual precipitation is 2 to 10 inches, which falls during summer thunderstorms and as gentle winter rains.  Mean January temperature is about 52 degrees F., and the average July temperature is about 92 degrees F.  Frost-free period is about 260 to 325 days."
