  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to more than 40 inches.  Depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 30 inches.  When the soil is dry, vertical cracks up to 5 cm wide extend from the surface to as deep as a meter.  Typically, the series control section averages between 45 and 60 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay or silty clay.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay, clay or silty clay loam.   It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have strata of silt loam below 40 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are no other series in the same family.  Other competing series are the Grail, Lawther, Magnus, Marias, Mondamin, Nutley, Savage and Sinai series.   Grail, Mondamin and Savage soils have Bt horizons which average between 35 and 50 percent clay.  Lawther soils have less than 10 percent sand in the surface layer and subsoil. Magnus soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter content with depth.  Marias soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Nutley and Sinai soils do not have intersecting slickensides."

The Wildrose soils formed in calcareous clayey glaciolacustrine deposits.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 17 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Marias and Mondamin soils and the Dooley, Farnuf, Sakakawea and Tansem soils.  Marias and Mondamin soils are on smooth nearly level to gently sloping areas in close association with the Wildrose soils.  Dooley and Sakakawea soils are on the outer edges of lake plains.  Farnuf and Tansem soils are on slight rises.  Dooley and Farnuf soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon.  In addition, Dooley soils have a sandy loam surface horizon.  Sakakawea soils are coarse-silty.  Tansem soils are fine-loamy."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: mollic epipedon - zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 44 inches (Ap, A, Bss1, Bss2, Bss3 and By horizons); Vertisol criteria - cracks (Ap, A, Bss1 and Bss2 horizons), intersecting slickensides and wedge shaped natural aggregates tilted 10 degrees to 60 degrees from horizontal (Bss2 horizon); chromic great group criteria - chroma of 2 in the upper 30 cm (Ap and A horizon).\nSoils previously correlated as Sinai in MLRA 53B (McLean and Ward Counties, North Dakota) would most probably be placed with the Wildrose series.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory sample S90ND-105-264 (NSSL and NDSHD).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
