  "OVERVIEW": "The Wildrose series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in glaciolacustrine deposits.  These soils are on lake plains and have slopes of 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches.",

Magnus soils have an irregular decrease in organic matter content with depth.  Marias soils do not have a mollic epipedon.  Nutley and Sinai soils do not have intersecting slickensides."

Farnuf and Tansem soils are on slight rises.  Dooley and Farnuf soils are fine-loamy and have an argillic horizon.  In addition, Dooley soils have a sandy loam surface horizon.  Sakakawea soils are coarse-silty.  Tansem soils are fine-loamy."
