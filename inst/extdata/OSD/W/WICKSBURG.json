  "STATES": "AL,FL,GA,SC",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wicksburg series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and clayey marine sediments of the Coastal Plain.  They are on nearly level to strongly sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent. Near the type location, the average annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 53 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid throughout except where lime has been added.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Thickness of A horizons with value of 3 is less than 10 inches.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, sand, or gravelly coarse sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or sand.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay.  Mottles in shades of red and brown range from none to common.  The lower part of the Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 6 or 8; or it has no dominant matrix color and is mottled in shades of yellow, brown, red, and gray.  Mottles in shades of red, brown, gray, and yellow range from few to many.  It is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay."

The average annual air temperature ranges from 63 to 68 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from 48 to 60 inches."

The poorly drained Plummer soils are on less dissected positions and have a sandy epipedon more than 40 inches thick.   Troup soils are on similar positions as the Wicksburg soils and have a sandy epipedon more than 40 inches thick."
