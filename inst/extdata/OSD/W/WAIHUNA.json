  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In some pedons weathered gravel and cobbles are scattered throughout the profile.  Mean annual soil temperature is about 69 degrees F.  The soil is dry in some horizon for more than 90 cumulative days in most years.  A strong granular surface mulch 1/2 to 2 inches thick develops upon drying.  Cracks 1/2 to 1 inch wide form to depths of more than 20 inches when the soil dries.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and chroma of 2 or 3.  Soil color is usually yellowest near the source of alluvium and somewhat redder with increasing distance.  The lower part of the C horizon ranges from silty clay to clay.  Few to common mottles occur in the lower part of the profile."

Honouliuli soils have 5YR hue throughout, and have mean annual soil temperature warmer than 71.6 degrees F.  Hoolehua soils have silty clay texture, lack slickensides, and do not form a granular surface mulch on drying.  Lualualei soils have deeply grooved slickensides and are dominantly montmorillonite clay.  Nonopahu soils have moist value of 4 or more in the A horizon and have isohyperthermic temperature.  Waialua soils have silty clay texture, mottles in the B horizons and a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 71.6 degrees F.  Waipahu soils have silty clay texture and a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 71.6 F."

Elevations range from 400 to 2,000 feet, but are primarily between 1,000 and 2,000 feet.  The soils formed in fine-textured alluvium.  Annual rainfall is 20 to 35 inches.  The average January temperature is about 67 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 72 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is about 69 degrees F."
