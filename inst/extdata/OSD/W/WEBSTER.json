    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 16 inches (Ap and A horizon); Cambic horizon - the zone from a depth of 16 to 40 inches (BAg, Bg1, Bg2 and BCg horizons); aquic moisture regime based on low chroma colors below the mollic epipedon.\nThe concepts of moderately coarse and moderately fine substratum phases were established by the mlra-103 steering committee.  The Des Moines Lobe till gets sandier and contains less clay as one progresses south along the path of the Des Moines advance.\nCompeting series not updated as of this edit."
