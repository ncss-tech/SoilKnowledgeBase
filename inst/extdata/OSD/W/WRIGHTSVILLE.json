  "OVERVIEW": "The Wrightsville series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in old silty and clayey alluvium. These soils are on level to depressional areas on old stream terraces. Slopes are less than 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1168 mm (46 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).",
