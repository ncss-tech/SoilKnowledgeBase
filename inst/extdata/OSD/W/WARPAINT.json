The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 25 to 35 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to the argillic horizon is 10 to 15 inches.  There is an absolute clay increase of 25 percent or more between AB and 2Bt horizons.\nThe A and AB horizon has value of 3 or 2 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 30 percent glass and acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the iron is 0.4 to 0.6 percent.  Clay content is 10 to 18 percent.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5Y moist or dry and value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is clay loam and clay with 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe 2Btk horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 5Y moist or dry and value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and 6 through 8 dry.

The Booth, Campcreek, Golars, Hankins, Jesh, Joenchris, Lacrol, Tippett and Zumwalt series have a xeric moisture regime.  Carryback soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and lack the surface ash influence.  Crowcamp soils have a hard, brittle layer at 25 to 40 inches and have a watertable at 2.5 to 5.0 feet in the spring."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Warpaint soils are on uplands at elevations of 4,000 to 5,000 feet.  These soils formed in residuum from John Day Formation tuffaceous sediments with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, the meam annual temperature is 40 to 46 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
