  "OVERVIEW": "The Warpaint Series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum from tuffaceous sediments with an influence of volcanic ash in the surface.  Warpaint soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F..",

The Booth, Campcreek, Golars, Hankins, Jesh, Joenchris, Lacrol, Tippett and Zumwalt series have a xeric moisture regime.  Carryback soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock and lack the surface ash influence.  Crowcamp soils have a hard, brittle layer at 25 to 40 inches and have a watertable at 2.5 to 5.0 feet in the spring."
