The cobbles and stones ranges from 10 to 35 percent and gravel from 10 to 30 percent. The control section of 10 inches to bedrock averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments. The A and B horizons are very strongly or extremely acid and the C horizon is strongly or very strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry. It is gravelly or cobbly loam with less than 18 percent clay and greater than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. This horizon is 15 to 24 inches thick. The upper part of the B horizon is massive and weakly or strongly cemented and the lower part weakly cemented or noncemented and friable or firm.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.

The climate is humid temperate with a mean annual precipitation of 70 to 90 inches much of which falls as snow during the winter months. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F., the mean January temperature is 31 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 55 degrees F. The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
