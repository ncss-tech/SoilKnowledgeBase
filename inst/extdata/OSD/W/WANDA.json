  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness and depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick and usually includes the upper part of the argillic horizon. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the A and upper Bt horizon and from strongly acid to slightly acid below. The particle size control section averages 5 to 35 percent coarse fragments, and 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon that is part of the mollic epipedon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR; value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry when part of the mollic epipedon; and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or their gravelly to extremely gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt below the mollic epipedon, 2Bt, and 3Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 10R, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silty clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam in the upper part, and gravelly silty clay loam or gravelly silty clay or their very gravelly analogues in the lower part."

These soils formed in a thin mantle of loess or other silty material mixed with colluvium from cherty limestone or tripoli.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 55 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 39 to 43 inches."

Eldorado and Keeno soils are loamy-skeletal and are on similar or more sloping positions. Newtonia soils are in upland basins or similar positions."
