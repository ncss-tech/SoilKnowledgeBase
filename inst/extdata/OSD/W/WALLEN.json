  "OVERVIEW": "The Wallen series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvial creep over residuum weathered from fine-grained sandstone, siltstone, and shale. They are on mountain tops and on mountain sides with warm aspect. Slopes range from 2 to 85 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Rock fragments, ranging from gravel to stones, make up 15 to 35 percent by volume of the surface layer and 35 to 70 percent of the B subsoil. Stony and rubbly phases are allowed in this soil. Reaction is extremely to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon or Ap horizons, where present, have hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4. Fine-earth texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam. Surface horizons with values of 2 or 3 are less than 6 inches thick.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. Fine-earth texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 4 or 6. Some pedons have lithochromic mottles in shades of brown and red in the lower part. Fine-earth texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy sand. Some pedons have a thin BC or C horizon with colors and textures similar to the lower part of the Bw horizon. Other pedons have thin Cr horizons overlying bedrock.\nThe R horizon is commonly unweathered sandstone, but grades to siltstone or shale in some areas."

At a weather station about 25 miles from the type location and at approximately the same elevation, average annual air temperature is 55 degrees F, and average annual precipitation is 50 inches."

Gilpin and Jefferson soils are fine-loamy. Ramsey soils are loamy. Gilpin and Jefferson soils have argillic horizons. Helechawa, Jefferson and Varilla soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock. Ramsey soils have bedrock within 20 inches."
