    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to the duripan is 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to the 2Bt horizon is 5 to 10 inches.  Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches.  There is an absolute increase in clay content of 15 to 30 percent between the A1 or A2 and 2Bt horizons.  Rock fragments are typically rounded.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 30 to 40 percent cobbles and 10 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay or silty clay averaging 50 to 60 percent clay.  It has 40 to 50 percent cobbles and 15 to 25 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe 2Bqm horizon is indurated throughout or indurated in the upper few inches and weakly to strongly cemented below.  It has 30 to 40 percent cobbles and 20 to 30 percent gravel.\nThe 3C horizon has 40 to 50 percent cobbles and 20 to 30 percent gravel.   The fine-earth fraction is sandy loam or loamy sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline."

Campcreek and Skullgulch soils are mapped in an association, with the Campcreek soils occupying south and west aspects and Skullgulch soils occupying north and east aspects on side slopes of terraces.  Campcreek soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick and Skullgulch soils have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick.  Marack soils are on adjacent lower terraces, and have a calcic horizon.  Rastus soils are moderately deep to a duripan and are not skeletal."
