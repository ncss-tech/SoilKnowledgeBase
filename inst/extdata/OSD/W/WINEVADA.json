  "OVERVIEW": "The Winevada series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone.  Winevada soils are on mountain slopes and plateaus.  Slopes range from 3 to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 39 to 44 degrees F. and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 56 to 59 degrees F.  Depth to the lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  The Cr horizon is absent in some pedons.  The particle-size  control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay, 15 to 35 percent silt, and 45 to 60 percent sand.  It is commonly a loam, sandy loam, or sandy clay loam.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 30 percent.  In some pedons, a thin layer immediately overlying the bedrock contains 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 16 to 30 inches thick.  The soil is noncalcareous throughout.\nThe A horizons have a value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon, if present, has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4."

The Adel, Bullbasin, Bullrey, Duff, Gallatin, Hackwood, Idmon, Karlan, Lamphier, Leavittville, Mundos, Osmund, Pavohroo, Rhone, and Taterheap soils lack bedrock above 40 inches.  Karlan, Leavittville, Lespate, Mundos, and Osmund soils have K horizons.  Secondset soils have moisture control sections that are moist for longer cumulative periods when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  Strictland soils have clay movement and accumulation in an insipient Bt horizon with clay films on the peds."
