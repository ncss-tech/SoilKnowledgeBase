  "OVERVIEW": "The Whiteface series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from andesite and basalt.  Whiteface\nsoils are on glacial outwash terraces and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F, and\nthe mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",
