    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 60 consecutive days during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F. The soils are more than 60 inches deep. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. The pscs has 20 to 35 percent clay.  Depth to aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less is greater than 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has weak to moderate granular to subangular blocky structure. Texture is silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay and 0 to 3 percent gravel. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe AB or BA horizons have value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. They have weak or moderate prismatic or subangular blocky structure. Texture is silt loam in the upper part and silt loam or silty clay loam in the lower part with 20 to 35 percent clay. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has weak to moderate prismatic or subangular blocky structure. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid. In some pedons it has faint redox features in the lower part, but it lacks redox depletions of chroma of 2 or less above depths of 40 inches.\nThe 2BCt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has weak prismatic or subangular blocky structure. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has weak prismatic or subangular blocky structure or is massive. Textue is silt loam or silty clay loam with 15 to 30 percent clay. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Willamette soils are on level to gently sloping broad valley terraces 2 to 50 feet higher than the valley flood plain at elevations of 150 to 400 feet. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The soils formed in indistinctly stratified silty alluvium of mixed materials or lacustrine silts of upper Pleistocene age. Beginning at the surface of the mineral soil, the depositional stratigraphy of the Willamette soil profile developed in the following Willamette Formation Members: (1) Greenback Member, and (2) Irish Bend Member. The climate is humid temperate. The average annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches. The average annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F., the average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F., and the average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Aloha, Amity, Concord, Dayton, and Woodburn soils. Aloha soils do not have a mollic epipedon or an argillic horizon and are on terraces. Amity soils have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 10 to 20 inches, have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick and occur in depressions or on less sloping positions on terraces. Concord and Dayton soils have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 0 to 10 inches. In addition, Concord is fine and Dayton has an abrupt textural change from the E to 2Bt horizons. They occur in depressions on terraces. Woodburn soils have a mollic epipedon less than 20 inches thick, have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 20 to 30 inches, and occur on terraces."
