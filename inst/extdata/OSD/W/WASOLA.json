Alred, Mano, and Ocie soils have contrasting particle size control sections and are on side slopes.  In addition, Ocie soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches. Eudy soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches and are on ridge tops. Gunlock soils are fine textured and are on similar positions. Hartville soils do not have fragic properties, and are on stream terraces. Pomme soils are well drained, do not have fragic properties, and are on similar positions"
