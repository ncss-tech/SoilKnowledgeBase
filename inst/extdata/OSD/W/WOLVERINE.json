  "OVERVIEW": "The Wolverine series consists of deep or very deep  excessively or somewhat excessively drained  drained soils on basalt plains and in lke basins.  They formed in eolian alluvial sands.  The average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F. and the average annual precipitation is about 11 inches.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.",
