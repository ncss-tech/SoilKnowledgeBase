  "OVERVIEW": "The Whatcom series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over glaciomarine drift.  Whatcom soils are on glaciomarine drift plains and occupy the upland position in the kame-kettle type topography.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in volcanic ash and loess over glaciomarine drift.  Whatcom soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS  These are the Barneston, Birchbay, Kline, Labounty, Shalcar, Squalicum, Whitehorn, and Yelm soils.  Barneston and Kline soils are sandy-skeletal.  Birchbay soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Squalicum and Yelm soils are coarse-loamy.  Labounty and Whitehorn soils have an aquic moisture regime and an umbric epipedon."
