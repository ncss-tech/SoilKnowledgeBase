These soils are usually moist, but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Thickness of volcanic ash influence and depth to the 2B horizon is 14 to 28 inches.  By weighted average, the upper part of the control section has 0 to 10 percent pebbles, and the lower part has 5 to 25 percent.  Clay content in the lower part of the control section ranges from 18 to 30 percent by weighted average.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist, 3 or 4 dry.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 4 through 6 moist and dry.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whatcom soils are on glaciomarine drift plains at elevations of 50 to 600 feet.  They occupy the upland position in a kame-kettle type topography.  Slopes are 0 to 60 percent.  The soils formed in volcanic ash and loess over glaciomarine drift.  Whatcom soils are in a marine climate with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS  These are the Barneston, Birchbay, Kline, Labounty, Shalcar, Squalicum, Whitehorn, and Yelm soils.  Barneston and Kline soils are sandy-skeletal.  Birchbay soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Squalicum and Yelm soils are coarse-loamy.  Labounty and Whitehorn soils have an aquic moisture regime and an umbric epipedon."
