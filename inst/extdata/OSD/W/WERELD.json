  "OVERVIEW": "The Wereld series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluviums derived from dolomite, limestone, and calcareous shale.  Wereld soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
