These soils formed in residuum and colluviums derived from dolomite, limestone, sandstone, chert and calcareous shale.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,830 to 2,135 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 400 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
