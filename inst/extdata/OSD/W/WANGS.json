  "REVDATE": "04/2007",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wangs series consists of shallow to paralithic contact with shale, well drained soils that formed in 15 to 50 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying shale.  These soils are on side slopes on dissected, bedrock-controlled uplands. Slope ranges from 6 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

Commonly there are isolated or thin beds of channers and flags of limestone in the shale matrix.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
