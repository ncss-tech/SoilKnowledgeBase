These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches.  The upper 7 to 12 inches has estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 22 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 5 to 15 percent coarse fragments by volume.\nThe A horizon has a value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and a chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  Organic matter is 2 to 3 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4, dry or moist.  The upper part is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The lower part is gravelly clay loam, very gravelly loam or cobbly silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline."

Georgecreek soils have 25 to 50 percent medium, coarse, and very coarse sand, are dry for 75 to 90 days, and have mollic epipedons 8 to 16 inches thick.  Glenrose soils have 10 to 25 medium, coarse, and very coarse sand, are dry 60 to 75 days, and have mollic epipedons that are 10 to 20 inches thick.  Hillcreek soils are dry for 60 yo 90 days.  Morical soils are 20 to 40 inches to weathered bedrock.  Mozen and Shushuskin soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Pachneum soils are dry for 75 to 90 days and have 5 to 15 percent rock fragments in the PSCS.  Ralock soils average 15 to 30 percent coarse fragments by volume and have secondary carbonates at a depth of 24 to 38 inches.  Rollinger soils are dry 100 to 120 days and have mollic epipedons more than 40 inches thick.

These soils formed in loess mixed with volcanic ash in the surface and colluvium from basalt.  Elevations are 2,500 to 3,300 feet. These soils are in a semiarid climate with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 12 to 15 inches.  Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F., average July temperature is about 69 degrees F., and  average annual temperature is about 48 degrees F. The frost-free season is 120 to 135 days."
