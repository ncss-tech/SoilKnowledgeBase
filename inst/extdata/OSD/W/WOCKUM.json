These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 90 to 100 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches.  The upper 7 to 12 inches has estimated bulk density of 1.15 to 1.30 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half extractable iron of 0.4 to 0.7 percent, and 15 bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 22 to 35 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 5 to 15 percent coarse fragments by volume.\nThe A horizon has a value of 3 or 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and a chroma of 1 or 2 dry or moist.  Organic matter is 2 to 3 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR and value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4, dry or moist.  The upper part is silt loam or silty clay loam.  The lower part is gravelly clay loam, very gravelly loam or cobbly silty clay loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline."

Morical soils are 20 to 40 inches to weathered bedrock.  Mozen and Shushuskin soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Pachneum soils are dry for 75 to 90 days and have 5 to 15 percent rock fragments in the PSCS.  Ralock soils average 15 to 30 percent coarse fragments by volume and have secondary carbonates at a depth of 24 to 38 inches.  Rollinger soils are dry 100 to 120 days and have mollic epipedons more than 40 inches thick.
