  "OVERVIEW": "The Waford series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in lacustrine sediments high in volcanic ash with a mantle of more recent volcanic ash.  Waford soils are on nearly level to gently sloping lake terraces and have slopes of 2 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

It is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F. from about April 1 to December 27 (271 days).  The soil temperature exceeds 8.3 degrees C. from about April 15 to November 20 (220 days).  Summer thunderstorms occur, but are sporadic and usually do not wet the moisture control section.  Aridic moisture regime bordering on xeric. The mean annual soil temperature is 8.3 to 11 degrees C.  Ash content is 30 to 60 percent by weight in the A and upper C horizons, and 30 to 50 percent in the stratified lake sediments.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 6/3 or 6/2.  Moist color is 10YR 5/3, 5/2, 4/3, 4/2, 3/3 or 3/2.  Textures are sand and loamy sand.  It contains 2 to 5 percent fine gravel and is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon color is 10YR 7/2 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 5/2 or 5/3.  Textures are fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  It has 5 to 15 percent gravel.  Reaction is moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2Bqk horizon color is 2.5Y 7/2 or 7/3.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/2, 5/3 or 6/3.  It is stratified with layers of strongly cemented and weakly cemented loamy sand, sandy loam and fine sandy loam.  It commonly contains fractured tufa layers 2mm to 5 mm thick.  It contains 0 to 10 percent gravel.  Reaction is moderately to very strongly alkaline.\nThe 3C horizon color is 2.5Y 6/2 or 6/3; 5Y 6/2 or 6/3 and moist color is 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, or 5/3; 5Y 4/3 or 5/3.  Textures are stratified gravelly sand and very gravelly loamy sand.  This horizon contains 10 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Reaction is slightly to strongly alkaline."
