Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in stream alluvium derived dominantly from shale and sandstone. The average annual precipitation ranges from 6 to 10 inches (152 to 254 mm). The average annual temperature ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F (11 to 12 degrees C). The average frost free period is 130 to 160 days."
