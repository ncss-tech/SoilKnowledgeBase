  "OVERVIEW": "The Wepo series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from shale and sandstone. Wepo soils are on stream terraces and have slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 8 inches (203 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F (12 degrees C).",
