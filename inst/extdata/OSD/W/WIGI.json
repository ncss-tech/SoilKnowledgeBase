  "OVERVIEW": "The Wigi consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils on tidal marshes and salt marshes of alluvial plains. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1015 millimeters. Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevation is 0 to 5 meters. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters.  The mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C. The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 275 to 330 days."
