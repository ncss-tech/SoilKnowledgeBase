  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wigi soils are on tidal marshes and salt marshes on alluvial plains near the Pacific Ocean and are influenced by its tidal fluctuations. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium. Elevation is 0 to 5 meters. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters.  The mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C. The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C. Frost free season is about 275 to 330 days."

Arlynda, Fluvaquentic Endoaquolls, Swainslough, and Weott soils are in backswamps, depressions, and low floodplain steps on alluvial plains above the influence of tidal fluctuations. Occidental soils are on reclaimed salt marshes and tidal marshes on alluvial plains farther from the Pacific Ocean and less influenced by its tidal fluctuations."
