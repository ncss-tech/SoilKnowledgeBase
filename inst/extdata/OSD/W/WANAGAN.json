  "OVERVIEW": "The Wanagan series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium.  These soils are on terraces and outwash plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",
