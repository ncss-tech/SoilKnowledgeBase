The soils are not usually dry but are dry in the 7 to 20 inch depth for more than 45 consecutive days.  The soil moisture regime is Xeric bordering on Aridic.\nThe mollic epipedon is less than 20 inches thick and organic matter decreases regularly or reaches levels less than 0.5 percent within a depth of 50 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch section is silt loam or loam containing less than 18 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3, dry or moist. It has weak, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure.  This horizon is mildly or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk1 horizon has value of 3.5 through 5 moist and 5.5 through 7 dry.\nThe Bk2 and Bk3  horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 6 moist, 6 through 8 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4, dry or moist. It contains 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate.  Texture is loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  This horizon is slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is similar in color to the Bk horizon and ranges from fine sandy loam to silty clay loam. It is mildly to moderately alkaline and its lime content is at least 5 percent less than the maximum lime content in overlying Ck horizons. Dark yellowish brown mottles may occur below a depth of 40 inches."
