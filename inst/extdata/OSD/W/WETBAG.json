  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetbag series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from tuff, tuff-breccia, and andesite.  Wetbag soils are on fan remnants and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm inches and the mean annual temperature is about 5.6 degrees C.",
