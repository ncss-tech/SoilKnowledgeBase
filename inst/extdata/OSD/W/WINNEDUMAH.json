    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Winnedumah soils are located in an area that has some artificial drainage.\nMajor diagnostic horizons and other soil characteristics recognized in the profile are:\nMajor Diagnostic Horizons:\n1.  Ochric epipedon--0 to 53 cm (An1, An2, An3).\n1.1  Organic carbon content ranges from 1 to 3 percent, but dry color values are 6 or 7 (Walkley-Black digestion method).\n1.2  Calcium carbonate equivalent less than 40 percent.  (Calcium carbonate percent by field kit).\n2.  Argillic horizon--53 to 178 cm (Bt, 2Btkb, 2Btb1)\n2.1  Clay content increases from about 20 percent in the An3 horizon and 21 percent in the BAt horizon to 27 percent in the 2Btkb horizon.\n2.2  Many faint clay films on peds and in pores, few distinct clay films on peds.\n2.3  Natric horizon not observed.  Weak prismatic in lower Bt but sodium absorption ratio is less than 13 in that horizon, and reaction is slightly alkaline (pH 7.4 to 7.8).\nOther Soil Characteristics:\n1.  Thermic temperature regime -- MAST 15 to 17.8 degrees C; this and other climatic characteristics are from available local climatic data and preliminary SCS data.\n2.  Mineralogy -- assumed mixed, no indication otherwise.\n3.  Particle size class -- fine-loamy based on hydrometer and field estimate of 71 to 122 cm control section.\n4.  Aridic moisture regime -- assumption based on vegetation indicators, depth to water table, and preliminary SCS moisture data.\n4.1  The MCS is dry throughout from May 15 to December 15.  It is moist throughout from Jan 15 to April 1.\n4.2  The soil temperature exceeds 5 degrees C. from February 1 to January 1 (335 days).  Within this time period, the MCS is dry from May 15 to December 15 (210 days).\n4.3  The soil temperature exceeds 8.3 degrees C. from March 1 to December 1 (270 days).  Within this time period, the MCS is dry from May 15 to December 1 (195 days).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Reno MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data. The remainder of this document has not been updated.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon was sampled in July, 1986 for characterization at the NSSL.  Sample number S86CA-27-5.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
