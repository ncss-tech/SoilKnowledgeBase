    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Werito soils are on toeslopes below mesas, cuestas and structural benches. The upper part of the profile of Werito soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. The lower part of the profile formed in weathered shale. Slope range from 1 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 6,000 feet (1,646 to 1,829 meters). The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual air temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F (10.0 to 12.8 degrees ). The average frost-free period is 130 to 160 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A horizon)\nCambic horizon - the zone from 3 to 14 inches (Bn1 and Bn2 horizons)\nParalithic contact - the boundary with shale bedrock at 34 inches (3Cr layer)\nThe By horizon is either too thin or does not contain enough gypsum to qualify as a gypsic horizon.\nThe dark colors and organic carbon of these soils is inherited from the parent materials and is non-pedogenic. This soil is too dry to meet the requirements of an Ustic intergrade. The low pH of the C horizon may be due to the presence of elemental sulfur or pyrite, also inherited from the underlying bedrock.\nCalcium carbonate equivalence determined with the use of a field volume calcimeter. Salinity values were determined on three pedons, including the type location, with a Wheatstone bridge.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Selected properties of the type location were determined by the NSSL as Pedon ID: 84NM045002\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy 14th Edition, 2014.\nUpdated and revised for the correlation of Ft. Defiance Area AZ715 2/08 DWD\nRevised for the correlation the SDJR - MLRA 35 - Werito loam, 1 to 3 percent slopes, November 2014, LJG2\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
