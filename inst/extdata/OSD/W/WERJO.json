Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevation is 4,700 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is arid.  Average annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches and average annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.

Bebeevar soils are sandy and lack aquic conditions within 40 inches of the soil surface.  Green River soils are coarse-loamy and lack aquic conditions within 40 inches.  Walrees soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, have an Ustic soil moisture regime, and are somewhat poorly drained.  Werlog soils are fine-loamy, have seasonal high water tables at 2 to 3.5 feet, and have aquic conditions higher in the profile."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Werjo soils are used for livestock grazing, irrigated crops and pasture, and urban development.  The present vegetation on the uncropped, saline phase is inland saltgrass, alkali sacaton, black greasewood, New Mexico olive, fourwing saltbush, and threadleaf rubber rabbitbrush.  Common crops on the irrigated phase are alfalfa for hay, corn, apples, cantaloupes, and grasses and legumes for pasture.  The natural (nonirrigated) phase of Werjo is strongly saline, while the irrigated phase is only slightly saline due to leaching by irrigation waters which has reduced the content of soluble sodium salts."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of 4 inches.  (A horizon)\nEntisol feature - The lack of diagnostic subsurface horizons due to young soil age\nFluventic feature - Alluvial stratification and an irregular organic carbon distribution\nAquic subgroup - Aquic conditions and redox depletions within 40 inches of the soil surface (C3 and C4 horizons)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nNote:  More acres of this series may exist in the adjacent survey area of San Juan County, New Mexico, Eastern Part.  In that published soil survey, the Werlog series was mapped with a depth to seasonal high water table of 2 to 5 feet.  Those pedons of Werlog with water tables between 3.5 and 5 feet should be within the range of this Werjo series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
