    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whitmire soils are on flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks but with a strong influence from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1,420 to 1,460 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 110 days."
