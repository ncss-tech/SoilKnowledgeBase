  "OVERVIEW": "The Widen series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from interbedded weakly consolidated shale and siltstone. These soils are on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
