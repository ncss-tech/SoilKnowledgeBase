  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick, depth to calcareous material ranges from 12 to 46 inches, and the solum ranges from 20 to 50 inches thick. Organic carbon in the mollic epipedon ranges from .8 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth. The soils are 80 to 100 percent base saturated. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent but are typically less than 3 percent and consist mainly of shale chips. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 degrees to 48 degrees F. Mean summer soil temperature ranges from 40 degrees to 58 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It usually has crumb or granular structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard and is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6. It usually has prismatic structure but has subangular blocky structure in some pedons. This horizon is typically silt loam or silty clay loam but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 40 to 70 percent, and sand from 5 to 35 percent with less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand. It has oriented clay films in some part. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR. It has 4 to 14 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and is moderately or strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Willow Creek soils are on gently to moderately sloping alluvial fans and valley sideslopes. Slopes usually range from 2 to about 20 percent. These soils formed in thick, calcareous, silty materials derived from siltstone and limestone. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 24 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer. Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 54 degrees F."
