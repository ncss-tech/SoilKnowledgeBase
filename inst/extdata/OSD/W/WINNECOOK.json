  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to bedrock ranges from 51 to 102 centimeters and thickness of the solum ranges from 46 to 89 centimeters. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam. Rock fragments range from 10 to 70 percent and the weighted average throughout the particle size control section is more than 35 percent by volume. The rock fragments are phyllite, slate, or shale. Stones and boulders cover 0 to 15 percent of the surface.Reaction ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid, unless limed.\nMost undisturbed pedons have thin O horizons that commonly overlie an E horizon.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nSome pedons have a 1 to 2 inch thick A horizon over an E horizon.  The A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bh horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bhs horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, with value 2 to 3 and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 8.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with color much like the C. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Consistence is very friable, friable, or firm.\nThe bedrock is generally phyllite, slate, or shale that is fractured in the upper part."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Winnecook soils are on upland till plains and hills. Slopes range from 2 to 45 percent. They developed in a moderately deep mantle of till derived principally from phyllite, slate, or shale. Depth to bedrock is 51 to 102 centimeters. The climate is humid and cool temperate. Mean annual temperature ranges from 3 to 8 degrees C and mean annual precipitation ranges from 86 to 117 centimeters. The frost-free season ranges from 100 to 150 days. Elevations range from 61 to 762 meters above mean sea level."

All, except Ragmuff and Thorndike soils, are deeper than 100 centimeters to bedrock, are on lower landscape positions, and have less than 35 percent rock fragments. Ragmuff (T) soils are moderately well drained. Thorndike soils are less than 25 centimeters to bedrock and are on similar or higher landscape positions."

Forest vegetation is mainly red spruce, white spruce, balsam fir, sugar maple, paper birch, yellow birch, eastern white pine, and some northern white cedar. Cleared areas are used for cultivated crops, hay, and pasture. Some areas are in urban uses."
