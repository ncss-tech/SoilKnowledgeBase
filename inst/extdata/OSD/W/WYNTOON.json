  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyntoon series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Wyntoon soils are on hills and fan remnants.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
