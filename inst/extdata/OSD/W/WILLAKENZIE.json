  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Willakenzie soils occur on summit (interfluve component), shoulder (nose slope component), and backslope positions (head slope and side slope components) of smooth convex hills along the margins of the Willamette Valley in Oregon. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent. Elevation is 200 to 900 feet where these soils occur on the Spencer Formation along the western margins of the Willamette Valley, and 300 to 1,400 feet where these soils occur on the Eugene and Fisher Formations along the eastern margins in the southern portion of the valley. Some areas are hummocky due to small slumps and slides. The soils formed in loamy colluvium and residuum derived from marine tuffaceous sandstone of the Spencer Formation or from arkosic and micaceous sandstone and siltstone of the Eugene Formation. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bellpine, Carlton, Chehulpum, Dupee, Hazelair, Jory, Panther Steiwer, Veneta, Wellsdale, and the competing Sitton (T) soils. Bellpine soils are fine textured, 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, have less than 35 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon, and occur on adjacent higher foothills. Carlton soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock, have a mollic epipedon, lack an argillic horizon, are moderately well drained, and occur on adjacent foot slopes and low terraces. Chehulpum soils are less than 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact, lack an argillic horizon, and occur on convex low hills. Dupee soils are somewhat poorly drained, fine textured, and occurs in the most concave part of drainageways on low hills. Hazelair soils have a mollic epipedon, are very fine textured, lack an argillic horizon, and occur on low hills. Jory soils are fine textured, are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock, have less than 35 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon, and occur on adjacent higher hills. Panther soils are poorly drained, are very fine textured, and occur in swales and depressions on low hills. Steiwer soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, have a mollic epipedon, lack an argillic horizon, and occur on low hills. Veneta soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock, are fine textured, and occur on old alluvial terraces. Wellsdale soils are moderately well drained, greater than 60 inches deep and occur on linear to concave low hills."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from the soil surface to a depth of 11 inches (Ap and A horizons). Dark colors in the modal Ap horizon do not meet umbric epipedon criteria for thickness.\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of 11 to 32 inches (Bt1and Bt2 horizons)\nParticle-size control section - from a depth of 11 to 31 inches (Bt1 and nearly the entire Bt2 horizon)\nTypical pedon relocated based on field observations and documentation from several counties in the MLRA 2 Willamette Valley update area to reflect a modal concept for this soil which has brown hues, active cation exchange activity class, medium to moderately fine textures in the argillic horizon, and dominantly occurs on the Eugene and Spencer Formation geology along the margins of the Willamette. Willakenzie soils occur on the Brateng (low hills) and Dolph (foothills) geomorphic surfaces.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features as noted in the range of characteristics start from the mineral soil surface.\nClassification revised 2/02 to reflect active mineralogy and fine-loamy family. This revision is based on extensive lab data.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data from representative pedons with User Pedon ID #'s 99OR003001, 99OR003002, 99OR003003, 99OR003004, 00OR003002, 62OR071003, and 01OR071007 NSSL, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
