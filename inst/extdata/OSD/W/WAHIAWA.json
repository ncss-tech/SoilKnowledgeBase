Kahana soils have an ochric epipedon and do not effervesce with hydrogen peroxide in the lower part of the B horizon.  Lahaina soils have an ochric epipedon and weak structure in the upper part of the solum.  Molokai soils have an ochric epipedon and prismatic structure in the B horizon.  Lihue soils are similar.  Lihue soils have an ochric epipedon and do not effervesce with hydrogen peroxide in the lower part of the B horizon."

Slopes are commonly 1 to 8 percent and range from 0 to 25 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and alluvium weathered from basalt.  Average annual rainfall is 40 to 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.; average January temperature is 69 degrees F., and average July temperature is 73 degrees F."

Kunia soils have weak structure in the upper part of the B horizon and do not have an oxic horizon.  Leilehua soils have an argillic horizon, weak structure in the upper part of the B horizon and are extremely acid throughout the solum.   Manana soils have an argillic horizon and have thin panlike layers at a depth of 15 to 50 inches."
