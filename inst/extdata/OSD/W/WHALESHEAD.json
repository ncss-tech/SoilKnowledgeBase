  "OVERVIEW": "The Whaleshead series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium derived dominantly from metasedimentary or metavilcanic rock.  Whaleshead soils are on side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is 27 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock is typically greater than 60 inches but in some pedons it may range from 40 to 60 inches deep.  Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick and includes the upper part of the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 30 to 45 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  It has a bulk density of 0.85 to 1.0 grams per cubic centimeter and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent.  Organic matter is 5 to 10 percent.\nThe BA horizon has colors similar to the A horizon.  It is very gravelly clay loam or very gravelly loam with 18 to 30 percent clay.  It has 30 to 45 percent gravel and 5 to 10 percent cobbles.  Organic matter is 5 to 8 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 40 to 50 percent gravel and 5 to 20 percent cobbles.  Organic matter is 3 to 5 percent.\nThe C horizon has value of 5 or 6 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly clay loam or extremely gravelly clay loam with 30 to 40 percent clay.  It has 45 to 55 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles."

The soils formed in colluvium derived from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types  of the Dothan and Otter Point Formations.  Elevation is 50 to 1000 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of termperature.  The mean annual precipitation is 85 to 95 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 210 to 270 days."

Millicoma soils are on side slopes of mountains.  Reedsport soils are fine-loamy and 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Reinhart soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact. Sebastian soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact and have serpentinitic mineralogy.  Svensen soils are fine-loamy, 40 to greater than 60 inches to bedrock, and are on broad ridgetops of mountains."
