  "OVERVIEW": "The Waywest series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced alluvium derived from mixed sources. Waywest soils are on valley floors and alluvial fans. Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 500 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.",
