  "OVERVIEW": "The Wacousta series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in silty lacustrine sediments. These soils are in broad depressions and swales on till plains, moraines, and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 775 millimeters",
