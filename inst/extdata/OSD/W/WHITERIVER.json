  "REVDATE": "02/1999",
  "STATES": "WY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Whiteriver series consists of deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils on broad plateaus.  They formed in alluvium or water-reworked eolian deposits overlying material derived from tuffaceous siltstone.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Rock fragments commonly are less than 5 percent but range to 15 percent in parts of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam or clay averaging 35 to 45 percent clay with 15 to 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon, or 2C horizon in some pedons, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is composed of tuffaceous materials and is clay loam or loam with 23 to 35 percent clay.  It has less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser excluding rock fragments.  Carbonates are mainly autogenetic.  However, some movement is evident in most pedons."
