Rock fragments commonly are less than 5 percent but range to 15 percent in parts of some pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is clay loam or clay averaging 35 to 45 percent clay with 15 to 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon, or 2C horizon in some pedons, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 6 or 7 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is composed of tuffaceous materials and is clay loam or loam with 23 to 35 percent clay.  It has less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser excluding rock fragments.  Carbonates are mainly autogenetic.  However, some movement is evident in most pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in alluvium or water-reworked eolian deposits overlying material derived from tuffaceous siltstone.  Elevation is 6,400 to 7,600 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 14 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 37 to 42 degrees F.  The average frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
