  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 6 to 24 inches.  The weighted average clay content in the control section is 18 to 35 percent but thin horizons are allowed with up to 42 percent clay content.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2.  The A horizon and AC horizon is silt loam and is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 in the upper part and chroma of 1 or 2 in the lower part.  It contains common or many mottles with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and higher chroma.  It commonly is silt loam or silty clay loam with less than 35 percent clay, but soils having silty clay texture below 36 inches are within the range.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid in the upper part and strongly acid or medium acid in the lower part."

Stendal soils have more sand and less clay in the lower C horizons.  Belknap and Wakeland soils are coarse-silty.  The Bonnie and Chequest soils are wetter, having dominant chroma of 1.  The Chequest soils, in addition, have mollic epipedons.  Coppock, Moniteau, and Racoon soils have argillic horizons and Coppock soils have mollic epipedons.  The Wilbur series is coarse-silty."

Dockery and Nodaway soils are nonacid and occur on adjacent flood plains or next to stream channels.  Sharon soils are coarse-silty and are on adjacent flood plains.  Moniteau and Racoon soils have argillic horizons and are on slightly higher stream terraces."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Westerville series was originally classified as Aeric Fluventic Haplaquepts.  When this classification was dropped from Taxonomy, it was transferred to its present classification.  Therefore, soils which are wet and show evidence of structural development or lack the criteria needed for argillic horizons are included with the Westerville series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
