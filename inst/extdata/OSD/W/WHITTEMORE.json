  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Whittemore series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are shallow to ortstein. Whittemore soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial deposits and in the underlying clayey lacustrine deposits on lake plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 737 mm (29 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C (44 degrees F).",
