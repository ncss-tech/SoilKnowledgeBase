Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 to 91 cm (1 to 3 feet) between October and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible to high depending on slope gradient and depth to the clayey material. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the sandy material; moderately high or high in the ortstein material; and low in the clayey material. Permeability is rapid in the upper sandy material, moderate or moderately rapid in the ortstein material and very slow in the underlying clayey material."
