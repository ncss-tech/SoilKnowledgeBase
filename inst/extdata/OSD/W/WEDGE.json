    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile are an albic horizon from mineral surface to 2 inches.  The particle-size control section from 1 to 41 inches is 46 percent pumice.  This description reflects a change in classification due to Andisols order from paragravelly ashy Typic Cryorthods to ashy-pumiceous Xeric Vitricryands.  The soil fails the criteria for spodic materials; pH is greater than 5.9 in modal pedon, the albic horizon is not always present as stated in range of characteristics and the color requirements for the spodic material is not always present.  The soil is considered as having a udic moisture regime when associated with the vegetation (Cascade azalea, western hemlock).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data available for this soil sample number 8753007010 (ABAM/TSHE/CLUN plant community) and 8753007008 (ABLA/VAMY plant community).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
