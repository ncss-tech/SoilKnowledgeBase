The soils formed in silty recent alluvium. The climate is characterized by warm to hot summers and moist to wet winters. Mean January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and mean July temperature is 65 to 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is typically 30 to 60 inches but may range to 90 inches in high winter rainfall valleys of southwestern Oregon (MLRA 5). The frost-free period is 150 to 210 days."

Camas soils are sandy-skeletal and occur on bars on flood plains. The medium textured Cloquato and Clato soils and moderately fine textured Chehalis soils are well drained and occur on higher flood plains. Maytown and McBee soils are moderately well drained with redoximorphic features in the lower part of the B horizon and occur in depressions on flood plains. In addition, Maytown soils have an ochric epipedon. Newberg soils are coarse-loamy and occur on level to slightly convex flood plains. Reed soils are fine textured, poorly drained and have an ochric epipedon. Cove and Waldo soils are fine textured. In addition, Cove soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 24 inches and occur on fans and terraces."
