Distinct masses of iron and manganese accumulation are throughout the A horizon or only in the lower part. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Soil reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has distinct to prominent masses of iron and manganese accumulation. It is dominantly silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay, but may range to silty clay below a depth of 30 inches. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel. It is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe BCg or C horizons are neutral, 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry. It has 0 to 15 percent gravel. It is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  In some pedons, the solum below 40 inches is underlain by stratified layers containing gravel and cobbles. It is moderately acid or slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Wapato soils are in depressions on flood plains and basin-like areas. Elevations are 100 to 2,500 feet. The slope is 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in silty recent alluvium. The climate is characterized by warm to hot summers and moist to wet winters. Mean January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and mean July temperature is 65 to 68 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 56 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation is typically 30 to 60 inches but may range to 90 inches in high winter rainfall valleys of southwestern Oregon (MLRA 5). The frost-free period is 150 to 210 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Camas, Cloquato, Chehalis, Clato, Cove, Maytown, McBee, Newberg, Reed, and Waldo soils. Camas soils are sandy-skeletal and occur on bars on flood plains. The medium textured Cloquato and Clato soils and moderately fine textured Chehalis soils are well drained and occur on higher flood plains. Maytown and McBee soils are moderately well drained with redoximorphic features in the lower part of the B horizon and occur in depressions on flood plains. In addition, Maytown soils have an ochric epipedon. Newberg soils are coarse-loamy and occur on level to slightly convex flood plains. Reed soils are fine textured, poorly drained and have an ochric epipedon. Cove and Waldo soils are fine textured. In addition, Cove soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 24 inches and occur on fans and terraces."
