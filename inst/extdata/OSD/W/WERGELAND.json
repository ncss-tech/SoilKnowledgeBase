  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mollic epipedon ranges from 18 to 41 cm thick. The soil typically is calcareous throughout, but some pedons lack carbonates to a depth of 15 cm. The 25 to 102 cm control section averages 18 to 30 percent clay and 15 to 30 percent fine sand or coarser. Calcium carbonate equivalent of the calcic horizon is from 15 to 30 percent. Some pedons have small amounts of gypsum (CaSo4). Rock fragments are typically lacking in the profile.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 or 1. It typically is loam, but in some pedons is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam. It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 or 1. It typically is loam, but in some pedons is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline\nThe Ab horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 0 or 1. It is silty clay loam, loam, clay loam, or silt loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. This horizon is not present in some pedons.\nThe Bk, Bg or Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 3. It typically is loam, but in some pedons it is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam pedons. It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nSome pedons have BC horizons with color and textures of the Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically is loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam in some pedons. It ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. Some pedons have sandy or gravelly material below a depth of 102 cm."
