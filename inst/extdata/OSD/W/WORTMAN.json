  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the soft siltstone ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The bedrock contains glass shards and has a high ratio of CEC to clay.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick and extends into the Bt horizon of most epipedons.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam, but some pedons are coarser textured when mantled by sandy eolian material.  The A horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has 10YR hue, value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is clay but some are clay loam, silty clay or silty clay loam averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.  SAR is greater than 13.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonates and some pedons have accumulations of gypsum and other salts.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam and ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is soft siltstone and ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wortman soils are nearly level or gently sloping on upland fans, and flats.  Surfaces are plane or slightly convex and microrelief commonly is evident.  Slope gradients typically are less than 3 percent but range up to 9 percent.  Wortman soils formed in residuum weathered from siltstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches."

Blackpipe, Huggins, Kadoka, Kube, Norrest, and Shena soils do not have a natric horizon and are on nearby uplands.  Goshen soils do not have a natric horizon and are in swales. Mosher and Wanblee soils are on similar landscapes. Mosher soils do not have bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Wanblee soils do not have a mollic epipedon."
