  "OVERVIEW": "The Wortman series consists of moderately deep, well drained and moderately well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from siltstone on upland fans and flats.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 9 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 15 inches thick and extends into the Bt horizon of most epipedons.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam, but some pedons are coarser textured when mantled by sandy eolian material.  The A horizon ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has 10YR hue, value of 5 to 7 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has 10YR hue, value of 4 or 5 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is clay but some are clay loam, silty clay or silty clay loam averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.  SAR is greater than 13.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  It has few to many accumulations of carbonates and some pedons have accumulations of gypsum and other salts.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam and ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR, value of 6 to 8 and 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 to 6.  It is soft siltstone and ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."
