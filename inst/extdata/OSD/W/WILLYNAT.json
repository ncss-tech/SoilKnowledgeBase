  "OVERVIEW": "The Willynat series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from quartz monzonite.  Willynat soils are on fan remnants.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
