  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Willowak series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.  Willowak soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 350 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
