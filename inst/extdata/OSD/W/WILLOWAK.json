  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Willowak soils are on hills and mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from volcanic rocks such as andesite, with additions of eolian volcanic ash.   Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 2,500 meters. The climate is semi-arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 400 mm, mean annual temperature is 6 to 8 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 40 to 70 days."
