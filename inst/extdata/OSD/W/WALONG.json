  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact with weathered granitic rock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil between depths of 8 to 24 inches is usually dry all the time from late May until mid November (or 1/2 the time), and is moist in some part for more than 90 consecutive days.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  Organic matter is more than 1 percent to a depth of 14 to 18 inches and decreases regularly to less than 1 percent at this depth.  An 01 horizon is present in some pedons where there has been some accumulation of organic matter or litter.  Rock fragments 2 mm to 2 cm in diameter range from 0 to 15 percent by volume, and rock fragments 7 to 25 cm in diameter range from 0 to 10 percent.\nThe A horizon is dark grayish brown grayish brown, dark brown, or brown (10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3; 7.5YR 5/2, 4/2). It is mainly sandy loam, but in some areas is gravelly sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  This horizon is medium acid or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon is dark grayish brown, grayish brown, light yellowish brown, yellowish brown, dark brown, brown or pale brown (10YR 4/2, 5/2, 4/3, 5/3, 6/3, 5/4, 6/4 or 7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 5/4). It is gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nWhere present the C horizon separating the B2 horizon and the Cr layer is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6) gravelly sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is medium acid or slightly acid."

Andregg soils have a difference between mean summer-winter soil temperature of 20 to 30 degrees F.  and are moist in some part more than 1/2 the time.  Pfeiffer soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 70 inches and have strong brown B2 horizons.  San Andreas soils have a difference between the average July-January soil temperature of less than 15 degrees F.  Anaverde soils have a lithic contact at depths of more than 40 inches and are mesic.  Sheridan soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and have less than 15 percent gravel.  Tunis soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of less than 20 inches."

The climate has cold moist winters and hot dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 30 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 62 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F.; and the mean July temperature is about 83 degrees F.
