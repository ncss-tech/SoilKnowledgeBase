  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilmont series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rock with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  These soils are on backslopes, footslopes, and toeslopes of mountains.  Slopes are 20 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
