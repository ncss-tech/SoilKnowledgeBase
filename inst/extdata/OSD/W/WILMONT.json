These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 8 to 24 inches for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The volcanic ash mantle ranges from 7 to 14 inches thick and has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.75 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 30 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments and 7 to 15 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  This horizon is 0 to 10 percent channers, and 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Some pedons do not have an A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 3 or 4 dry or moist.  It is ashy silt loam, ashy loam, or channery ashy silt loam.  It contains 5 to 20 percent channers, 0 to 10 percent pebbles, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.\nThe 2Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.

Belzar, Hartill, Kloochman, Oxerine and Wilma soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Ohscow soils are dominated by angular granitic rock fragments.  McCree soils have a volcanic ash mantle 14 to 27 inches thick.  Newbell soils have sola 10 to 14 inches thick and contain mainly rounded and subrounded rock fragments. Tall soils have distinct clay bands in the 2A and 2B horizons and are 18 to 25 percent clay in the lower part of the control section.  Threemile soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and have secondary carbonates in the lower part of the control section."

These soil formed in colluvium and residuum from sedimentary and metasedimentary rock with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess.  Slopes are 20 to 65 percent.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  Mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 64 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
