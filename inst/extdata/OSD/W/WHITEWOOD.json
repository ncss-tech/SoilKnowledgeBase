    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from 30 to 52 inches or more.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 24 to 60 inches or more.  The series control section averages between 25 and 35 percent clay and contains less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.\nWhitewood soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control section for 30 to 45 days out of the 120 following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral; value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry; and chroma of 0 or 1.  It typically is silty clay loam, but is silt loam in some pedons.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Some pedons have a BA or AB horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 or 3 and 4 or 5 dry; and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam and slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  Redox concentrations range from few to many and faint to prominent.\nThe Bg and Bkg horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam.  They have common or many redox concentrations.  The Bg horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline.  The Bkg horizon has common to many masses of calcium carbonate and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a BCg or Cg horizon.\nSome pedons have a 2Cg horizon of calcareous, firm clay loam or loam glacial till below 40 inches."

Clementine soils are dry in all parts of the soil moisture control sectio for more than 45 days out of the 120 following the summer solstice.  Colo soils are more than 60 inches to free lime and average less than 15 percent sand in the control section.  Otter soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Pastolla soils have a major component of volcanic ash and are moist in all parts of the soil moisture control section more than 99 percent of the time each year in more than 6 years out of 10.  Sawmill soils are moist in some part of the soil moisture control section for more than 90 out of the 120 days following the summer solstice in more than 6 years out of 10."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whitewood soils are on nearly level flats, swales, and upland drainageways.  Slopes typically are plane or concave. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Whitewood soils formed in local silty alluvium derived from loess or silty drift mantling glacial till.  Mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 20 to 26 inches.  Growing season is about 130 to 165 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 17 to 20 inches; and growing degree days are about 2700 to 3500."

Beadle, Egan, and Wentworth soils are on adjacent uplands and have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Beadle soils formed in clay glacial till.  Egan and Wentworth soils formed in silty materials.  Viborg soils have glacial till or drift above a depth of 40 inches and are in shallow, better drained swales and drainageways.  The fine textured Worthing soils are in depressions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained and poorly drained.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Surface runoff is low, however in the center of many drainways concentrated flow (flooding) occurs frequently for very brief duration. In undisturbed areas, seasonal high saturation occurs at or near the surface in normal years, typically in the spring."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Used for both cultivated crops and as pasture.  In upland drains, it often is left in grass as grassed waterways.  Some of the large flat areas are fenced as permanent pasture.  Where cultivated, corn, soybeans, small grains, and alfalfa are the principal crops.  Native vegetation includes big bluestem, switchgrass, indiangrass, sideoats grama, forbs, and sedges."
