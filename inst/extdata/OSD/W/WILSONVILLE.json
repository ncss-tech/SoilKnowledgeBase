When mixed, the control section averages less than 35 percent gravel and cobbles, and the matrix averages about fine sandy loam.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam. Gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with lenses of very fine sandy loam. This horizon is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe IIC horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It is loamy sand or loamy coarse sand.\nThe IIIC horizon has hue 2.5Y or 10YR. It has 45 to 80 percent gravel and 10 to 25 percent cobbles. The matrix is sand or loamy coarse sand.
