  "OVERVIEW": "The Wimper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium or colluvium.  These soils are on stream terraces, alluvial fans, fan remnants, eroded fan remnants, escarpments, hillslopes and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 425 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 4.5 degrees C.",
