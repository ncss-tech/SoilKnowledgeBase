These soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 12 and 35 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 15 inches thick.  Rock fragments in the control section average 35 to 70 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand and is gravelly, stony, or extremely stony.  It is 15 to 35 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent stones.  Reaction is neutral to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand.  It is 30 to 60 percent gravel, 0 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 2 percent stones."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium and glacial outwash.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is 11 to 16 inches.  Average January temperature is 24 degrees F, average July temperature is 67 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 100 to 135 days."

Owhi soils have cambic horizons and are dry in all parts for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Spens soils do not have a mollic epipedon."
