  "STATES": "IN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitcomb series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed loess, silty slope alluvium, and the underlying residuum from black shale. They are moderately deep to a layer with fragic soil properties. Whitcomb soils are on strath terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days."

In drained areas, the depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is medium.
