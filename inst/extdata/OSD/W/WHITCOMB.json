  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Whitcomb soils are on strath terraces adjacent to till plains considered to be of the Illinoian stage. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in loess, silty slope alluvium, and the underlying residuum from black shale. In Indiana, the shale is from the New Albany formation, Devonian System. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 170 to 200 days."

The moderately well drained Deputy and Jennings soils are on backslopes of higher lying till plains. The moderately well drained Scottsburg soils are on summits and shoulders of strath terraces. The well drained, moderately deep Trappist soils are on lower lying backslopes."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. In undrained areas, the depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 46 cm (0.5 to 1.5 feet) between December and April in normal years. In drained areas, the depth to the top of the perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the horizon with fragic soil properties and low to moderately high in and below this horizon. Permeability is moderate above the horizon with fragic soil properties and slow or very slow in and below this horizon."

The basic concept remains the same as was in 1972.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 23 cm (9 inches) (A and Ap horizons).\nArgillic horizon: 38 to 142 cm (15 to 56 inches) (Btg1, Btg2, 2Btgx1, 2Btgx2, 3Btg horizons).\nFragic soil properties: 76 to 122 cm (30 to 48 inches) (2Btgx1 and 2Btgx2 horizons).\nRedoximorphic features: at 23 to 155 cm (9 to 61 inches); clay films with a chroma of 2 or less are iron depleted redoximorphic features.\nLithic contact: at 155 cm (61 inches).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab data available for the typical pedon, S89IN-143-14 is at the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
