  "OVERVIEW": "The Weminuche series consists of very deep, well drained  soils that formed in slope alluvium derived dominantly from redbed sandstone.  Weminuche soils are on backslopes and toeslopes of mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 5 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
