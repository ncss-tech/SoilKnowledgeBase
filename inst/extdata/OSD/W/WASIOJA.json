  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 degrees F. and the soil temperature usually is below 47 degrees F. from late January until late February.  The soil between depths of about 5 and 15 inches is usually dry all of the time from about May 10 until January 1 and is moist in some or all parts all the rest of the year.  Some pedons have less than 2 percent rock fragments in the A, B, and C horizons.  Pedons with more rock fragments usually have both cobblestones and gravel.  Cobblestones range up to 15 percent of the A and Bt horizons and up to 30 percent of BC or C horizons.  Gravel makes up to 20 percent of the A and Bt horizons and up to 50 percent of the BC or C horizons.\nThe A horizons is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam and has less than 18 percent clay.  In most pedons this horizon is massive and hard or very hard throughout. In some pedons this horizon has weak or moderate structure.  This horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline and becomes more alkaline with increasing depth.  It is calcareous in the lower part in some pedons.  The A-Bt horizon boundary is abrupt or clear.\nThe Bt horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 and 7/4.  It is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam and averages 20 to 25 percent clay.  This horizon has weak to moderate angular or subangular blocky structure in most parts and in some pedons is massive in the lower part.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons disseminated and segregated carbonates are usually present in some part but are lacking in the upper half of the horizon.\nThe C horizon is variable as to texture.  Many pedons have coarse stratification and the texture is loamy sand, sandy loam, loam or sandy clay loam.  Some strata are very cobbly."

Each of these soils have a xeric moisture regime and are moist for more than 90 continuous days when the soil temperature is above 47 degrees F.  Accelerator soils have a paralithic contact at 40 to 60 inches.  Boga soils are 60 to 80 inches deep to a dense substratum and do not have carbonates in the argillic horizon.  Blasingame, Bressa, and Tivy soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Creviscreek and Pomo soils are not calcareous in the argillic horizon.  Fallbrook, Montpellier, Ramona, and Wyman soils have hue redder than 10YR in the Bt horizon.  Loem stone soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a dense substratum,  Nodhill soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to weakly cemented sediments.  Snelling soils lack free lime in the soil profile.  Sesame soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wasioja soils are on smooth alluvial fans, fan remnants, and dissected terraces at elevations of 800 to 4,500 feet. Gradients are 0 to 50 percent.  They formed in alluvium that averages medium texture, is more or less gravelly and cobbly, and is derived from sedimentary, metasedimentary and mixed rock sources.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation is 7 to 12 inches and snow is quickly melted.  Average January temperature is about 43 degrees F., average July temperature is about 75 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 58 to 60 degrees F.  The freeze-free season is 175 to 300 days."
