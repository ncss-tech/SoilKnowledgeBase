  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetpark series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in slope alluvium and colluvium from mixed rock sources.  These soils occur on structural benches and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
