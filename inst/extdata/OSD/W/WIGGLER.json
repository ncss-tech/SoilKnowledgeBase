  "OVERVIEW": "The Wiggler series consists of very shallow or shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from sandstone and shale.  These soils are on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 15 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches. and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
