  "OVERVIEW": "The Whiskeylog series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from metamorphic rock. The Whiskeylog soils are on mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 895 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
