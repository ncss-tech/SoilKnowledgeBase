  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to weathered bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Depth to hard rock is 40 to more than 60 inches. Rock fragments of gravel, cobble, and stone size range from 0 to 50 percent in the A horizons and 0 to 35 percent in the B horizon. Dark concretions range from none to common. Soil reaction ranges from strongly acid through slightly acid in the upper horizons and from moderately acid through mildly alkaline in the lower horizon. Clay content averages 18 to 35 percent for the combined A, Bt, and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. The A and E horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. The A horizon in eroded phases is sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles, bodies, or streaks of black, greenish, grayish, or whitish saprolite or primary minerals are few to common in most pedons. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction. Thin transitional horizons are present in most pedons.\nThe BC or CB horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8. Mottles, bodies, or streaks of black, greenish, grayish, or whitish saprolite or primary minerals are none to common. Texture is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, is loamy saprolite of intermediate or mafic crystalline rock. It is black, greenish, brownish, or grayish in color.\nThe Cr layer is soft, weathered intermediate or mafic crystalline rock that can be dug with difficulty with a spade.\nThe R layer (where present) is hard unweathered to slightly weathered intermediate or mafic crystalline rock."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Soils in related families include the Goldston, Louisa, Louisburg, Montevallo, and Poindexter series. Goldston and Montevallo soils have more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Louisa soils have cyclic pedons and contain more mica throughout the sola. Louisburg soils lack continuous Bt horizons. Poindexter soils have a paralithic contact at depths of more than 20 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wilkes soils are on gently sloping narrow ridges and sloping to steep side of ridges between intermittent and permanent streams in the southern Piedmont. Slopes are generally between 10 and 25 percent and range from 4 to 60 percent. The soil formed in residuum weathered from diorite, hornblende, schist, and related rocks that are moderately high in ferromagnesian minerals or from a mixture of felsic and mafic rocks. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 60 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 65 degrees F."

These soils are all deeper to bedrock than Wilkes soils. Coronaca, Cullen, Enon, Gaston, Mecklenburg, Mocksville, Poindexter, and Wynott soils are well drained and in similar landscape positions Crawfordville(T), Iredell, Pittsboro, Sedgefield, and Virgilina soils have redoximorphic features due to wetness, are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained, and are in flats, depressions, and foot slopes."
