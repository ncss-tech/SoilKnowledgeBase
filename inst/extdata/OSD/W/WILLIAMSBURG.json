  "OVERVIEW": "The Williamsburg series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess or silty alluvium and the underlying stratified outwash of silty and loamy material with some gravel. These soils are on high terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

The streams are within areas of Illinoian age materials but originate in areas of Wisconsinan Age materials. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The soils formed in a mantle of loess or silty alluvium 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches) in thickness and the underlying stratified silty and loamy outwash or alluvium with some gravel. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 55 degrees F)."
