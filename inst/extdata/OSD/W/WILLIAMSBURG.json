  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Williamsburg soils are generally on relatively high terraces along streams. The streams are within areas of Illinoian age materials but originate in areas of Wisconsinan Age materials. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The soils formed in a mantle of loess or silty alluvium 30 to 61 cm (12 to 24 inches) in thickness and the underlying stratified silty and loamy outwash or alluvium with some gravel. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1143 mm (40 to 45 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 12 to 13 degrees C (53 to 55 degrees F)."

The moderately well drained Sardinia soils are in lower lying topographic positions. Avonburg, Cincinnati, Clermont, Jonesboro, Nicely, Rossmoyne, Schaffer, and Westboro soils formed in loess over till on the nearby Illinoian till plain. Fox and Ockley soils formed in outwash over stratified sands and gravels and are on lower terrace levels."
