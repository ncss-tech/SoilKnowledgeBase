    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates ranges from 0 to 12 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 19 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is clay, clay loam, or silty clay that averages between 35 and 55 percent clay with less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the upper part and slightly to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  The SAR ranges from 10 to 15 in the upper 10 inches and is 13 to 25 in some portion of the lower part of the Bt horizon.\nThe Bkz horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist; and value of 1 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or clay is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has common to many accumulation of salts and carbonates.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist; and chroma of 1 to 4.  The C horizon typically is silty clay loam or silt loam stratified with layers of very fine sandy loam to clay.  Bedding stratification is evident in most pedons.  It ranges from slightly to strongly alkaline.  Mudstone or siltstone are below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons."

Cactusflat soils do not have a natric horizon and are on similar landscapes.  Cedarpass soils contain less clay and are higher on the landscape than the Weta soils.  Nunn soils do not have a natric horizon and contain more sand throughout than the Weta soils.  They are slightly higher on the landscape."
