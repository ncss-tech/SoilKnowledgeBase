  "OVERVIEW": "The Watoopah series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks with a component of volcanic ash. Watoopah soils are on fan piedmonts and fan remnants. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 225 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
