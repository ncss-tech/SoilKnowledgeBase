Rounded ironstone and quartzite pebbles range from none to few throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Some pedons have hue of 10YR in the lower part. Redox concentrations in shades of brown, red, or yellow range from none to few. A few streaks or spots of uncoated sand are in the lower part of the Bt horizon some pedons. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."
