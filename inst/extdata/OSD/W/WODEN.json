  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is more than 80 inches thick. The clay content of the control section ranges from 12 to 18 percent and the silt content exceeds 20 percent. Base saturation ranges from 35 to 60 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the top of the argillic horizon. Rounded ironstone and quartzite pebbles range from none to few throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 8. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Some pedons have hue of 10YR in the lower part. Redox concentrations in shades of brown, red, or yellow range from none to few. A few streaks or spots of uncoated sand are in the lower part of the Bt horizon some pedons. Texture is fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Woden soils are on nearly level to gently sloping Pleistocene age and younger stream terraces on the Western Coastal Plain. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Surfaces are plane to convex. The soil formed in loamy alluvial sediments. The climate is humid with average annual rainfall ranging from 40 to 50 inches. The mean annual temperature ranges from 65 degrees to 68 degrees F. Frost free days range from 235 to 260. The elevation ranges from 100 to 300 feet above sea level. The Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 64."

Woodland includes shortleaf and loblolly pine, red oak, water oak, and sweetgum. Some areas are cropped to corn, small grain for grazing or truck crops."
