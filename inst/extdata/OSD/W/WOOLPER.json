    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 40 to\n60 inches or more, and depth to bedrock ranges from about 60 inches to 100 inches or more.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  The weighted average of rock fragments of limestone, siltstone, sandstone, or shale range from 0 to 15 percent but individual B horizons range to 35 percent.  Some pedons have a few or common black or dark brown concretions or soft concretionary-like material in some or all horizons.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to about 24 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 2 or 3,\nand chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma 2 to 4.   Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.    Some pedons have transitional horizons up to 12 inches thick with the same colors of the A horizon. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay. Some pedons have a few or common mottles in shades of gray below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5Y or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma 2 to 4.  Mottles are in shades of brown, gray, and olive, or colors like those of the Bt horizon.  Texture is silty clay or clay."

Donerail and Loradale soils are medium or strongly acid, and their Bt horizons are not part of the mollic epipedon.  Montello  soils have sola less than 40 inches thick, and typically have thinner mollic epipedons.  Schapville soils have sola and depth to shale of less than 40 inches.  The Wamego soils have a dryer climate."
