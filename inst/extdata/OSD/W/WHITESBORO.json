  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is more than 60 inches thick.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to about 60 inches thick.  The texture of the particle-size control section is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with clay content ranging from 22 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  There are few to common redoximorphic concentrations and/or depletions in shades of brown and gray within a depth of 24 to 40 inches of the surface.  Texture is fine sandy loam, loam or clay loam in the upper part of the A horizon and includes sandy clay loam in the lower part of the A horizon.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  There are few to many redoximorphic concentrations and/or depletions in shades of brown, gray, red, or yellow, and some pedons have a mixed matrix of these colors.  Texture is clay loam, loam, or sandy clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the upper part and neutral to moderately alkaline in the lower part.  This soil does not have aquic conditions in most years.  Redox features are contemporary but they have formed during wet years."
