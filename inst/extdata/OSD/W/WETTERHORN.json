  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetterhorn series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in medium to moderately fine textured noncalcareous sediments weathered from underlying bedrock on moderately to steeply sloping mountain sides and ridges. Slope ranges from 6 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 510 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 1 degree C.",

Azarman, Bead, Blackleaf, Dell, Lail, Mikesell and Soldier soils lack a lithic contact at depths shallower than 100 cm.  Bead, Lail, Foxton, McVickers and Soldier soils have lithochromic hue of 5YR or redder.  Chubbs soils are calcareous above 100 cm, and have continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Gateway, Hatch, Mikesell and Sielo soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 100 cm.  Also, Gateway soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments throughout the solum and have argillic horizons that contain less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand."
