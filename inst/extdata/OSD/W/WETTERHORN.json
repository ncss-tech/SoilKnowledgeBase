  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  These soils are slightly acid to neutral throughout.  Some pedons have thin dark colored A horizons. Average cation exchange capacity to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 60 to 100 millequivalents per 100 grams of clay.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent in a major portion of the solum.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 32 to 46 degrees F., mean summer soil temperature from 38 to 46 degrees F. with an 0 horizon at least 4 inches thick and under a good crown cover.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It usually has platy structure but has subangular blocky or granular structure in some pedons. This horizon is soft or slightly hard and is neutral to medium acid.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically heavy clay loam or light clay in the matrix but clay ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 15 to 45 percent, and sand from 15 to 45 percent.  Oriented clay films occur in some part of this horizon. It is neutral to medium acid."

Azarman, Bead, Blackleaf, Dell, Lail, Mikesell and Soldier soils lack a lithic contact at depths shallower than 40 inches.  Bead, Lail, Foxton, McVickers and Soldier soils have lithochromic hue of 5YR or redder.  Chubbs soils are calcareous above 40 inches, and have continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.  Gateway, Hatch, Mikesell and Sielo soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Also, Gateway soils have less than 15 percent coarse fragments throughout the solum and have argillic horizons that contain less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wetterhorn soils are on moderately to steeply sloping mountain sides and ridges.  Slopes usually range from 6 to about 50 percent.  These soils formed in medium to moderately fine textured noncalcareous sediments that have weathered from underlying bedrock.  At the type location these soils occur at elevations in excess of 7,500 feet.  Average annual precipitation is about 20 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer.  Mean annual temperature is 34 degrees F., and mean summer temperature is 48 degrees F."
