    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wileyflat soils are on plateau tops and ridges. Elevation is 4000 to 6800 feet. Slopes are 0 to 40 percent. These soils formed in ash mixed with colluvium over residuum from pyroclastic tuffs. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 20 inches. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost free period is 60 to 90 days."
