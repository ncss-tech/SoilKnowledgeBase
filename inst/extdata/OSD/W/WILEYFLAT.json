  "OVERVIEW": "The Wileyflat series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in ash mixed with colluvium over residuum from pyroclastic tuffs. These soils are on plateau tops and ridges with slopes from 0 to 40 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches and mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.",
