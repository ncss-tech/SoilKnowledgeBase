  "OVERVIEW": "The Weingart series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium, colluvium, or residuum weathered from semiconsolidated shale or interbedded shale and sandstone.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
