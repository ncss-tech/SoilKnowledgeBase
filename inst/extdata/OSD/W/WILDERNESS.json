  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 15 to 29 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Pedons with E horizons have value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is the gravelly or very gravelly analogues of silt loam or loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Some pedons have a BE horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is the very gravelly, very cobbly, or extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam.  Reaction is slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2Ex, Btx, Bx and 2Btx horizons are mottled with 5YR to 10YR hue, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. In some pedons the Ex horizon has lower chroma than the Bx horizon and there is an indication of very weak coarse platy structure but the high chert content largely obscures this feature.  The gravel content ranges from 25 to 85 percent by volume. Texture is the gravelly to extremely gravelly, and very cobbly to extremely cobbly analogues of loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.  Pedons that are associated with interbedded cherty limestone and sandstone have texture of very cobbly or very gravelly sandy loam. Reaction is strongly acid to extremely acid.\nThe 2Bt or 3Bt horizon has hue of 10R to 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 8.  It is the gravelly to extremely gravelly analogues of silty clay or clay but in some pedons is clay.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the Keeno series.  Similar soils in other families are the Nixa and Scholten series. Keeno soils have an A horizon with color value of 3 or less moist and 5 or less dry.  Nixa soils do not have an argillic horizon above the fragipan.  Scholten soils are ultisols."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wilderness soils are on gently sloping to steep upland ridgetops and side slopes.  Slope gradients are dominantly 2 to 9 percent with an extreme range of 35 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and the underlying residuum from cherty limestone. The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 45 inches."

The Clarksville, Coulstone, Doniphan, and Poynor soils do not have a fragipan and commonly are on steeper side slopes.  The Captina, Lebanon, Tonti and Viraton soils have less than 35 percent by volume coarse fragments in the particle size control section and are on more gently sloping, wider ridgetops, upslope from the Wilderness soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

The saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high above the fragipan, low in the fragipan, and moderately high below the fragipan.  The surface runoff index is high to very high.  A seasonal high water table is from 1.0 to 2.0 feet for brief periods from December through April in most years."
