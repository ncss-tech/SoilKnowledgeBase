  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist and are saturated for prolonged periods during the winter and spring.  The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F.  The depth to the underlying clayey substratum is 14 to 28 inches.  The absolute difference in clay content between the subsoil and the substratum is 25 percent or more.  The solum is medium to slightly acid.  The substratum is slightly acid to mildly alkaline increasing with depth.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Some areas have a 2 to 3 inch recent deposit of grayish brown coarse silt loam on the surface.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist and 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is massive, or has weak coarse prismatic or subangular blocky structure in the upper part and is massive below.  It is silty clay or clay with 55 to 65 percent clay.\nThe 3C horizon commonly is gravelly sandy clay loam but ranges from sand to clay loam and has 20 to 35 percent gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whiteson soils are on flood plains at elevations of 200 to 700 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in recent alluvium over fine textured older alluvium or lacustrine sediments.  The climate is humid temperate with cool wet winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches.  The mean January temperature is 39 degrees F, mean July temperature 67 degrees F, and the mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

Bashaw and Natroy soils have clay texture within 10 inches of the surface and cracks from the surface to depths of 20 inches or more when dry.  Chehalis and McBee soils are moderately fine textured and well and moderately well drained respectively.  Wapato soils are fine-silty and lack a contrasting particle-size control section."
