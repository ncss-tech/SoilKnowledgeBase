It contains 30 to 45 percent cobbles and 15 to 30 percent gravel.  The soil reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is silty clay loam or clay loam.

The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from basalt with an influence of loess in the surface.  The climate is characterized by cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.   The mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days."
