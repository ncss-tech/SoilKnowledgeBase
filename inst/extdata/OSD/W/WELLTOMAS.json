  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Elevations range from 4,900 to 7,020 feet. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 26 inches, most of which comes as snow. The mean annual temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."
