  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodside series includes weakly developed soils forming in noncalcareous till on foothills of mountains and on terminal moraines where mountain glaciers entered the valleys from deeply incised canyons. The till consists of a mass of boulders and cobble firmly embedded in sandy fine-earth material derived largely from granite, gneiss and schist rocks, but includes some material from quartzite and other metamorphosed sedimentaries.",

At the lower elevations these soils have quite well defined A2 horizons but at higher elevations the A2 is weak and the Bir of weak Podzols is beginning to form in the upper part of the A2."

Stronger chroma in the A2 of Woodside than in Como soils indicate they are somewhat gradational to weak Podzols (Brown Podzolic soils). The associated moderately to strongly developed Lick soils on much older till have clear horizon differentiation and much stronger chroma and more clay in their B2 horizons than either Woodside or Como soils."
