At the lower elevations these soils have quite well defined A2 horizons but at higher elevations the A2 is weak and the Bir of weak Podzols is beginning to form in the upper part of the A2."

Stronger chroma in the A2 of Woodside than in Como soils indicate they are somewhat gradational to weak Podzols (Brown Podzolic soils). The associated moderately to strongly developed Lick soils on much older till have clear horizon differentiation and much stronger chroma and more clay in their B2 horizons than either Woodside or Como soils."

Western yellow pine with an undergrowth of shrubs and grasses in the more open places. Some deciduous broad-leafed trees grow where moisture is above average for the soil."
