  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is saturated during the winter and has a temporary water table during stormy periods throughout the year unless drained.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 53 degrees F.  The difference between the mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  Soil depth is over 60 inches, but rooting depth may be limited by the seasonal water table.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick.  The particle-size control section dominantly is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  All horizons have redox concentrations that range from faint to prominent with moist value of 5 and chroma of 4 through 6 moist in the 10YR hue.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of neutral to 2 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand becoming coarser with increasing depth.  In some pedons there are thin strata of finer textures below a depth of 35 inches.  Moist chroma of 1 is below 30 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Willanch soils are in shallow swales and concave depressions on flood plains at elevations from 0 to 100 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvial deposits consisting of coarse and moderately coarse textured material.  Occasionally thin layers of fresh alluvium may be deposited on the surface by overflow water.  The soils are in a cool wet marine climate with a mean annual precipitation of 50 to 90 inches.  The mean January temperature is 43 degrees F., the mean July temperature is 61 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 300 days."
