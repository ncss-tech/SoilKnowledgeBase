  "OVERVIEW": "The Wingdale series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils\nthat formed in mixed alluvium with volcanic ash and loess in\nthe surface layers.  They are on flood plains and have\nslopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is\nabout 11 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is\nabout 48 degrees F.",
