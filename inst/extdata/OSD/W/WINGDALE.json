Soil reaction ranges from\nmoderately to strongly alkaline with slight or strong\neffervescence.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y.  It is silt loam, or\nsilty clay loam.  It is moderately or slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y.  It is silty clay loam\nor silt loam, with 0 to 30 percent gravel.
