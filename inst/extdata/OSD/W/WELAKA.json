Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to medium acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture and reaction ranges are the same as in the A horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture is sand or fine sand.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Color is due to iron oxide coatings on sand grains.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is gravelly sand, gravelly fine sand, very gravelly sand, or very gravelly fine sand.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  Fragments are 2 to 10 mm shells and range from 15 to 60 percent by volume."
