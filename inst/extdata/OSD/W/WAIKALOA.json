These soils are on all hillslope positions of undulating to hilly lava flows that are greater than 100,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 250 to 510 millimeters (10 to 20 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1780 to 2030 millimeters (70 to 80 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 15 to 22 degrees C. (60 to 71 degrees F.) The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C. (11 degrees F.)"
