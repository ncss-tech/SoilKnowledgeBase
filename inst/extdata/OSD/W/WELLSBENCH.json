  "OVERVIEW": "The Wellsbench series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and residuum and/or colluvium weathered from basalt. Wellsbench soils are on benches, canyon sides, and footslopes and have slopes of 2 to 55 percent. They have slow permeability. The average annual precipitation is about 26 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
