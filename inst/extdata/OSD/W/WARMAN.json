    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the contrasting particle size (2C horizon) ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The depth to free carbonates exceeds 70 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 24 inches thick.  The volume of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 10 percent by volume in the upper part and 5 to 50 percent in the 2C horizon.\nSome pedons have an 0 horizon as much as 3 inches thick.  The Ap or A horizons have value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  Mottles are present in the lower part of some pedons.  It is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or fine sandy loam, and commonly has a mucky modifier.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Some pedons have a BA horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The lower part of the Bg horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  The Bg horizon has distinct or prominent mottles in all parts.  It is loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have sandy loam subhorizons.  The Bg horizon averages less than 50 percent fine and coarser sand.  It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is coarse sand, sand, gravelly sand, or gravelly coarse sand.  It has 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  Thin strata of finer textured material are in some pedons.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral."

They formed in a 20 to 40 inch loamy mantle over glacial outwash derived from Late Wisconsinan glaciation.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 25 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 150.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 670 to 1600 feet."

The Chetek and Cloquet soils are somewhat excessively drained and are in higher lying positions.  Oesterle and Rosholt are better drained and are slightly higher in the landscape.  Organic soils are common associates toward the center of depressions."
