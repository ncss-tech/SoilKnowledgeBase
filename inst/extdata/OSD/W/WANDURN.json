  "OVERVIEW": "The Wandurn series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from monzonite.  Wandurn soils are on south-facing backslopes of mountains and north-facing backslopes of high hills.  Slopes are 30 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
