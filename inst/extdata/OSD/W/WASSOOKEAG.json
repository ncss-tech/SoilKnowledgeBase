  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mineral solum thickness ranges from 61 to 147 cm. Residuum in the form of highly fractured bedrock (2Cr horizons) or non-cemented saprolite (2C horizon), where present, is at a depth of 60 to 125 cm. Depth to unweathered bedrock (2R horizon) is 100 to 150 cm. Rock fragments in the form of gravel, channers, or cobbles range from 5 to 25 percent in the solum, and 0 to 30 percent in the till substratum where present. Parachanners typically range from 0 to 15 percent in the subsoil and 5 to 20 percent in the till substratum where presesnt.  Parachanners, channers and flagstones range from 20 to 75 percent in the residual substratum.  Very friable remnants of highly weathered fine and medium pebble-sized pelitic limestone are present in some pedons in the the subsoil and till substratum where present. These remnants are intact within the profile but are easily crushed when rubbed between the fingers. Reaction in unlimed areas is strongly acid to neutral in the solum and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum. Average clay content in the subsoil and till substratum where present is 8 to 18 percent.\nForested areas may have an Oe horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe Ap or A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, and value and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture in the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, and value and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture in the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture in the fine-earth fraction is silt loam or loam.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y. Texture in the fine-earth fraction is similar to the BC horizon.\nThe 2Cr horizon is highly fractured limestone-interbedded phyllite. It constitutes paralithic material.\nSome pedons have residual 2C horizons in the form of non-cemented saprolite overlying the 2Cr horizons. The 2C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. It is saprolite. Texture in the fine earth fraction is very fine sandy loam, silt loam or fine sandy loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wassookeag soils are on linear to slightly concave side slopes of ground moraines. Slope ranges from 1 to 8 percent. The soils formed in glacial till derived from limestone-interbedded phyllite, calcareous metasiltstone, and pelitic limestone. Residuum in the form of fractured bedrock or highly weathered saprolite typically underlies the till. Surface stones and boulders range from 0 to 3 percent. Elevations are 50 to 230 meters. The mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 1135 mm. The mean annual temperature is 5 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free period is 115 to 155 days."

Corinna soils are somewhat excessively drained and shallow to bedrock, and are on slightly convex summits and shoulders. Penobscot soils are well drained and moderately deep to bedrock, and are on linear to slightly convex summits and side slopes. Kenduskeag soils are somewhat poorly drained on footslopes. The very deep moderately well drained Chesuncook soils, and the very deep, somewhat poorly drained Telos soils formed in lodgment till, and are on side slopes and toe slopes. Sebasticook soils are well drained and deep to bedrock, and are on linear to slightly convex summits and side slopes. The moderately well drained Boothbay, the somewhat poorly drained Pushaw, and the poorly drained Swanville soils formed in very deep glaciomarine or glaciolacustrine sediments, and are on adjacent lake plains or marine terraces, at slightly lower elevations."

The dominant vegetation where cultivated is potatoes, corn, or small-grain crops. Some areas are used for hay production. The dominant vegetation where wooded is northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), sugar maple (Acer saccharum), white ash (Fraxinus americana), basswood (Tilia Americana) and American beech (Fagus grandifolia)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The series name (pronounced WAH suh keg) is taken from one of the larger lakes of Southern Penobscot County, Maine. This soil is part of a proposed catena of soils that include Sebasticook, Penobscot, and Corinna. They developed in till that is shallow to deep to calcareous metamorphic bedrock of the Waterville and Sangerville Formations in Central Maine. In comparison to other soils of the region they have a higher base saturation, water-holding capacity, and saturated hydraulic conductivity. They are considered agriculturally productive, particularly for potatoes.\nThe subgroup is revised from Aquic Dystric to Oxyaquic, and the mineralogy class to mixed with this revision.  It is recognized that some pedons characterized for series development have isotic mineralogy.\nFeatures similar to those described as remnants of highly weathered pelitic limestone, were historically described as \"limestone ghosts\" in some places.\nReaction updated based on KSSL data for the Bw1, Bw2, and BC horizons only; others were field measured using Cornell field kit. Measured field values for the Bw1, Bw2, and BC were 6.7, 6.0. and 6.5, respectively.  Field texture of the Bw1 was loam. KSSL data placed this horizon in the sandy loam class but near the boundary with loam.  It is not the typical range for this series and the typical pedon is maintained as a loam.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 30 cm (Ap horizon).\n2. Evidence of oxyaquic conditions--redox depletions and concentrations from 74 to 119 cm.\nCambic horizon--from a depth of 30 to 74 cm (Bw horizon).\n3. Lithic contact--at 147 cm (2R horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Primary characterization from pedon 04N0381, samples 04NO2257, 04NO2258 and 04NO2263, from Penobscot County, Maine, samples by SSL, Lincoln, NE, 03/04.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
