  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 35 inches. Depth to free carbonates ranges from 10 to 32 inches. Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches. Rock fragments of mostly gravel and cobbles range from 10 to 55 percent by volume in the solum, and from 40 to 65 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. Gravelly phases are common and cobbly phases are less common. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is often sandy loam or loam, and less commonly fine sandy loam. Some pedons have thin subhorizons of loamy fine sand or loamy sand in the fine-earth fraction. Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loamy sand or sandy loam. Reaction ranges from neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is gravel, cobbles, or stones with sand, loamy sand, or sandy loam materials in the interstices. It has varying degrees of stratification. Reaction is mildly or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Posen series was in the same family, but has not been classified for CEC activity class. Posen soils do not occur in Land Resource Region R. The Posen soils have Bh or Bs horizons.\nThe Colton and Raquette series are similar soils in related families. The Colton soils have a sandy-skeletal particle-size class and there are no free carbonates within the soil. The Raquette soils have a sandy particle-size class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Waddington soils are on convex sloping outwash plains, kames or beach ridges in the uplands. The slope gradient ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The soils formed in calcareous glaciofluvial or wave sorted materials. The mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 45 degrees F. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches. The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 150 days. Elevation ranges from 200 to 600 feet above sea-level."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Grenville, Hogansburg, Kalurah, Malone, Nehasne, Pyrities, and Raquette soils. Grenville and Pyrities soils are on similar topographic positions as Waddington soils, but they have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control sections. Hogansburg, Kalurah, and Malone soils are on lower topographic positions and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control sections. Nehasne soils are in areas of bedrock control and have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Raquette soils are on similar topographic positions and have a sandy particle-size control section."

    "content": "REMARKS: Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified. Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 12 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Typic Eutrochrepts feature - the presence of carbonates at approximately 12 inches (BC horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon was characterized by the Cornell University Soil Survey Laboratory in 1982 and is identified as S81NY89-1.\nSoil Interpretation Record: NY0372\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
