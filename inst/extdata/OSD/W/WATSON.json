  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  Bedrock is usually below 60 inches.  Depth to fragipan ranges from 18 to 32 inches.  Rock fragments of subrounded gravel or shale usually increase with depth and range from 5 to 20 percent in the surface, from 10 to 40 percent in individual horizons of the Bt, and from 10 to 50 percent in the Bx horizons.  Reaction throughout the soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid where unlimed.  Illite is the dominant clay mineral with smaller amounts of kaolinite, vermiculite, and montmorillonite.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Low chroma mottles are within 30 inches of the soil surface.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam in the fine-earth fraction with less than 40 percent sand.  Structure is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky and blocky with friable or firm consistence.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 6.  Mottle colors include gray, light gray, light brownish gray and pinkish gray.  Texture is the same as the Bt horizon.  Structure is weak very coarse prismatic that parts to medium to very thick platy or fine to coarse subangular blocky or blocky .\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR.  Texture is silt loam, loam, or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction commonly with 40 percent or more rock fragments."

The Annandale, Hanover, Laidig, and Meckesville soils do not have low chroma mottles within 30 inches of the surface.  Beltsville soils have less than 10 percent gravel in the argillic horizon.  Califon soils contain fragments of granitic rocks.  Delassus soils are formed in loess.  Monongahela soils have water-worn rock fragments.  Tonti soils have rock fragments dominated by chert.  Trego soils have more than 40 percent sand in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are mainly in the glaciated section of the Ridge and Valley area.  The slopes are nearly level to moderately steep.  Gradients are dominantly 3 to 8 percent but range from 0 to 20 percent.  The soils formed in loamy pre-Wisconsin glacial till derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale similar to that of the underlying rock.  The climate is humid temperate, mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 48 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F., the frost-free season ranges from 140 to 170 days."

The nearby Bedington, Berks, Hartleton, and Weikert soils do not have fragipans.  Berks, Hartleton and Weikert soils also have more than 35 percent rock fragments.  Berks and Weikert soils, in addition, are less than 40 inches deep to shale bedrock."
