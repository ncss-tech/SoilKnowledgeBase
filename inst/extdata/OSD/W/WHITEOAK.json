  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crossnore, Jeffrey, Tusquitee, Porters, and Unaka series.  Crossnore soils have soft bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Jeffrey and Unaka soils have hard at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Porters soils have bedrock at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Tusquitee soils formed in colluvium derived from high-grade metamorphic rock such as gneiss and contain fragments of those rocks.  Porters and Unaka soils formed in residuum from high-grade metamorphic rock such as gneiss."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whiteoak soils are on gently sloping to steep toe slopes, benches, and fans in coves in the Southern Appalachian Mountains.  Elevation ranges from about 1,400 to 3,500 feet.  Slope is commonly between 5 to 25 percent but ranges from 2 to 50 percent. Whiteoak soils formed in colluvium derived from materials weathered from metasedimentary rocks such as phyllite, metasandstone, quartzite, and slate.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brasstown, Cataska, Cheoah, Junaluska, Lonon, Nantahala, Northcove, Santeetlah, Soco, Spivey, and Stecoah soils.  The Brasstown, Cataska, Cheoah, Junaluska, Nantahala, Soco, and Stecoah soils formed in residuum, have C horizons of saprolite, and are on nearby mountain ridges and side slopes.  In addition, Brasstown, Junaluska, and Nantahala soils have an argillic horizon.  The Lonon and Northcove soils formed in colluvium, and have ochric epipedons that are too thin or light in color to meet requirements for Umbric Dystrochepts.  Also, Lonon soils have an argillic horizon and Northcove soils are loamy-skeletal.  The Santeetlah soils are coarse-loamy, and the Spivey soils are loamy-skeletal.  Lonon, Northcove, Santeetlah, and Spivey soils are in the same landscape position as Whiteoak soils."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Much of this soil has been cleared and is used for corn, burley tobacco, small grains, truck crops, ornamentals, and pasture, as well as urban development.  Woodland species are yellow-poplar, eastern white pine, white oak, scarlet oak, northern red oak, red maple, sweet birch, eastern hemlock, black locust, and American beech.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The 7/90 revision of the series changed the subgroup classification from Humic Hapludults to Umbric Dystrochrepts.  National Soil Survey Laboratory data from the typical pedon (pedon 86P 938, samples 86P5658-5664) documents a cambic horizon instead of an argillic.  The Whiteoak series was formerly included with the Saunook series. However, Saunook soils formed in colluvial material derived primarily from igneous and metamorphic crystalline rocks, contain fragments of those rocks, and have an argillic horizon.\nThe 7/98 revision places Whiteoak soils in an isotic mineralogy class.  Laboratory data for the type location indicates a mixed, superactive family.  However, the pedon narrowly misses the 1500 kPa/clay ratio requirement of 0.6 or more for the isotic family.  Based on similar soils, this soil was placed in the isotic family.  Horizon depths and runoff class were also adjusted with this revision.\nUsing the 7th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy (1996), Whiteoak soils would classify as fine-loamy, isotic, mesic Andic Dystrochrepts.  However, a proposal has been made to add an acid oxalate-extractable silicon requirement to Andic subgroups, which would exclude Whiteoak soils, which lack volcanic glass.  The 2/99 revision updates classification to the 8th Edition of Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 0 to 12 inches (Oe, Ap and BA horizons).\nCambic horizon - 9 to 62 inches (BA, Bw1, Bw2 and BC horizons)\nUmbric-like feature - color value of 3 in the 0 to 9 inch zone (Oe and Ap horizons)\nIsotic mineralogy class - within the PSCS the soil generally has high amorphous materials (high pH-dependent charge) and a high moisture retention (at 1500 kPa) to clay ratio.\nProperties that would place the soil in an Andic subgroup--a horizon or horizons with total thickness of 7 inches (18 cm) or more within 30 inches (75 cm) of the mineral soil surface with a fine-earth bulk density of 1.0 g/cm3 or less (at 33 kPa water retention) and ammonium oxalate extractable aluminum plus 1/2 iron percentages totaling more than 1.0.\nRevised:  7/90-LBH,STE,AG; 12/97-DHK; 2/99-MKC\n01-2011   Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification --  BPS\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
