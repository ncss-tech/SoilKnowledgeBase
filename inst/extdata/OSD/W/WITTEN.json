Carter soils have a very fine textured argillic horizon and have 20 percent or more clay increase from the A horizon to the B horizon.  Erd soils are somewhat poorly drained and have salts higher in the profile.  Kolls soils are located below Witten in the wetter part of the swales.  They have reduced matrix conditions that begin within 10 centimeters of the soil surface.   Millboro and Promise soils typically are on nearby uplands above the Witten soils.  Promise soils have a very fine textured control section and do not have an argillic horizon."
