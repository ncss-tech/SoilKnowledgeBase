  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils have either cambic horizons or characteristics of the mollic epipedon that are equivalent of cambic horizons.  Unless otherwise stated the entire range of properties permissible for the diagnostic horizons and the subgroup and family are also permissible for the series.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 10 to 40 inches but should not be shallower than the midpoint of the mollic epipedon.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the control section except that a few subhorizons that exceed those ranges may occur discontinuously in some pedons.  Depth to continuous concentrated horizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 12 to 40 inches.  Depth to a lithic contact ranges from 20 to more than 40 inches.  The control section is normally a loam or clay loam but clay may range from 18 to 35 percent, silt from 20 to 55 percent and sand from 20 to 55 percent with less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Content of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the control section.  Mottling ranges from no mottling to a few faint mottles but when mottled the base chroma of the matrix must exceed 2.  The control section is uniform with only minor contrasting strata.  These soils should occur in areas having peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer months or nearly equal precipitation in all months if mean annual precipitation does not exceed 30 inches.\nColor of the A horizon may range in hue from 5Y to 7.5YR, in value from 4 to 5 dry and 2 to 3 moist, and in chroma from 1 to 3.  Reaction normally ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nColor of the B2 horizon if present may range in hue from 5Y to 7.5YR, in value from 5 to 7 dry or 4 to 6 moist, and in chroma from 2 to 6.  Reaction normally ranges from neutral to mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  This horizon shows some evidence of alteration such as redder hue, brighter chroma, or moderate grades of structure, or shows some evidence of the translocation of calcium carbonate or other soluble salt.\nHue of the C horizon may range from 5Y to 7.5YR.  Reaction normally ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Calcium carbonate accumulation ranges from about 4 to 14 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Other series in the same subgroup and family include the Auzqui, Babb, Bynum, Dewville, Emerald, Latang, Promontory, Redcloud, Tampico, Teton, Thayne, and Tilton series.  The Auzqui, Babb, Dewville, Emerald, Latang, Redcloud, Tampico, Thayne, and Tilton series differ in lacking bedrock of any kind above 40 inches.  The Bynum series differs in having a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches instead of a lithic contact.  The Promontory series differs in being noncalcareous throughout and in lacking continuous horizons of secondary carbonate accumulation.  The Teton series of Montana differs in lacking a cambic horizon or in having a mollic epipedon whose lower part is equivalent of a cambic horizon and in lacking continuous horizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wrenman series occurs on nearly level to moderately steep upland hills and ridges.  Slopes typically range from about 2 to 20 percent.  The soil lis developing in moderately thin, calcareous, medium to moderately fine textured materials weathered residually from sedimentary rocks.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in the spring and early summer months.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 degrees F., mean summer air temperature is 56 degrees F., mean annual soil temperature is 41 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is 56 degrees F.  The elevation is 7,800 to 8,600 feet."
