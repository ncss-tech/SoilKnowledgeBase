  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wildhill soils are on bedrock-controlled lake terraces in Pleistocene lake basins.  They formed in eolian deposits derived from mixed rocks over reworked alluvium and colluvium derived from basalt.  These soils occur downwind of a salty playa (Summer Lake) and frequently receive new deposits of loess high in sodium salts.  Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Elevations range from 1,290 to 1,880 meters.  The climate is semiarid and characterized by cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 9 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."
