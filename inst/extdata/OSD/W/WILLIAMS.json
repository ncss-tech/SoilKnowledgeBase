Stony and cobbly phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  Some pedons in native grassland have a moist chroma of less than 1.5 in the upper 1 to 3 inches.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silty clay loam or silt loam.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam and contains 24 to 35 percent clay.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  It has strong or moderate, medium or coarse prismatic structure that parts to strong or moderate, medium or fine angular or subangular blocky.\nThe Btk horizon, where present, and Bk horizon have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are loam or clay loam.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Carbonates are disseminated and segregated in masses.  Some pedons have a BC or BCk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam.

Beartooth soils are above an elevation of 4500 feet.  Beeno, Lefor and Reeder soils have a paralithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Bookcliff soils are calcareous in the upper part of the argillic horizon and have hard sandstone bedrock within depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Bullflat soils have a 2C horizon with 15 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Cortyzack soils occur at elevations of more than 6800 feet. Dooley and Hangdo soils formed in alluvial or eolian sediments over glacial till and have sandy clay loam Bt horizons.  Empedrado soils are dry in the spring and early summer for at least 15 consecutive days. Fairfield soils formed in alluvium and are less than 10 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizons.  Farnuf soils formed in alluvium, commonly are more alkaline, and contain stratifications in the C horizon.  Felor soils formed in loamy sediments overlying clayey sediments.  Greenway soils formed in loamy sediments over firm glacial till and have more clay in the lower part of the solum and substratum. Gurney, Mauldin, Moen and Watrous soils have lithic contact within depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Krem soils have a sandy epipedon 20 to 40 inches in thickness over the argillic horizon.  Lininger soils are moderately deep over schist.  Livona soils formed in eolian sediments over glacial till and have coarse-loamy surface horizons 10 to 20 inches thick.  Martinsdale soils formed in alluvium and have 2C and 3C horizons.  Sponseller soils have Bt horizons with hues of 7.5YR or redder.  Trag soils do not have horizons of carbonate accumulations. Ulrant soils have 20 to 35 percent granite pebbles in the Bt and Bk horizons which formed in alluvium derived from granite or limestone. Vida soils formed in till and are less than 10 inches deep to the base of the argillic horizon.  Wemple soils formed in alluvium and are underlain with material high in volcanic ash.  Yegen soils formed on uplands and fans and have sandy clay loam Bt horizons."
