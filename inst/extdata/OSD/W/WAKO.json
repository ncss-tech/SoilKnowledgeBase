Arbidge and Ochoco soils have duripans less than 10 inches thick.  Dacker soils have silty clay loam argillic horizons and lack an E horizon.  Debab soils contain 10 to 30 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon and lack E horizons.  Deerlodge and Excel soils have hues redder than 10YR in the argillic horizon and lack E horizons.  Ditchcamp, Snowmore, and Wendell soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Drysel soils lack bedrock below the duripan at 40 to 60 inches and lack E horizons.  Hager soils lack a calcic horizon.  Idow soils lack E horizons.  Lembos soils are calcareous in the argillic horizon.  Rakane soils lack a calcareous layer with cemented nodules directly above the duripan.  Wellsed soils are strongly or very strongly alkaline in the layer between the argillic horizon and the duripan and lack E horizons."
