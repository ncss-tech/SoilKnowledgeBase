  "OVERVIEW": "The Wako series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in eolian material that has been reworked by water.  Wako soils are on basalt plains and buttes and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Arbidge and Ochoco soils have duripans less than 10 inches thick.  Dacker soils have silty clay loam argillic horizons and lack an E horizon.  Debab soils contain 10 to 30 percent rock fragments in the Bt horizon and lack E horizons.  Deerlodge and Excel soils have hues redder than 10YR in the argillic horizon and lack E horizons.  Ditchcamp, Snowmore, and Wendell soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Drysel soils lack bedrock below the duripan at 40 to 60 inches and lack E horizons.  Hager soils lack a calcic horizon.  Idow soils lack E horizons.  Lembos soils are calcareous in the argillic horizon.  Rakane soils lack a calcareous layer with cemented nodules directly above the duripan.  Wellsed soils are strongly or very strongly alkaline in the layer between the argillic horizon and the duripan and lack E horizons."
