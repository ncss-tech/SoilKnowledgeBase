  "OVERVIEW": "The Waukenabo series consists of very deep poorly drained soils that formed in stratified lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains and stream terraces.  These soils have moderate permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
