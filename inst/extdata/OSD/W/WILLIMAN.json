In some pedons, the lower part of the B horizon and the C horizon have fine flakes of mica, fine dark colored minerals, or as much as 4 percent pebbles of ironstone. The mineralogy of the clay fraction is mixed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 1.  Where the value is less than 3.5, the A horizon is less than 10 inches thick.

Mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red are in most pedons.  In pedons with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y the chroma can range to 3 or 4.  The Btg horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe BCg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, 5GY, or neutral, value of 5 to 8, and chroma 1 to 3.

The BCg horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy fine sand or it is stratified in sandy and loamy textures.\nThe Cg horizon, where present, has colors similar to the BCg horizon.  Texture is variable, ranging from sandy to clayey material"
