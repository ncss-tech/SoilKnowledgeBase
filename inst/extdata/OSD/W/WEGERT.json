Bonnick, Borobey, Emamount, Embal, Gardone, and Picturerock soils are very deep.  Frentera soils do not have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section and do not have subhorizons above the lithic contact with greater than 40 percent rock fragments.  Stookmoor soils have firm, brittle horizons, do not have ashy sandy textures in the particle-size control section, and do not have subhorizons above the lithic contact with greater than 40 percent rock fragments.  Oatmanflat and Tuffcabin soils are deep to buried duripans."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wegert soils are on lava plains and lava plateaus.  These soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice over residuum derived from basalt.  Much of the volcanic ash is from ancestral Mt. Mazama.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 1,630 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 80 days."
