  "OVERVIEW": "The Wegert series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed volcanic ash and pumice over residuum derived from basalt.  Wegert soils are on lava plains and lava plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C.",
