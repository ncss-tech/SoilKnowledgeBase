    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The average annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. These soils are usually moist in the moisture control section but are dry for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 30 inches. The upper part of the particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.35 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 50 percent, including 3 to 10 percent sand-size ash, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser, 3 to 15 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 7 to 15 percent. The lower part of the particle-size control section has 5 to 30 percent volcanic glass, 5 to 30 percent rock fragments and 5 to 12 percent clay. Depth to dense compacted till, or bedrock, is 40 to 60 inches.  Thickness of the volcanic ash influence is 20 to 30 inches.\nThe Ap and A horizons have a value of 4 or 5 dry, 1 to 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist. Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent.\nThe 2Bw1 horizon has chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist. Texture is cobbly loam or gravelly loam. Rock fragments range from 15 to 30 percent.\nThe 2Bw2 horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 2 to 4 dry, 3 or 4 moist. Texture is gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Rock fragments range from 5 to 25 percent.\nWhen present, the 2Cd horizon hue is 10YR or 2.5Y. The value is 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 dry, 2 to 4 moist. There is 5 to 40 percent rock fragments and the texture is sandy loam, loam or loamy sand."

These soils formed in a mixture of volcanic ash and loess over ablation and dense till or bedrock. Slopes are 0 to 60 percent. Elevations are 1,800 to 2,900 feet. The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool moist winters. Average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches. Average January temperature is about 26 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 70 degrees F. and average annual temperature is 47 to 49 degrees F. Frost-free season is 110 to 165 days."
