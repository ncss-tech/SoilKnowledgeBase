  "OVERVIEW": "The Watseka series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy eolian deposits or outwash sediments. These soils are on outwash plains or stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F.).",
