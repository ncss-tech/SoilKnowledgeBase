Elevations are 280 to 375 feet.  The climate is arid with hot dry summers and cool, slightly moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 6 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F.  Mean July temperature is about 85 degrees F., and mean January temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 250 to 300 days."
