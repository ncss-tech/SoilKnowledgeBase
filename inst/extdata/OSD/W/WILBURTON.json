Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and\nchroma 2 to 4. Texture is loam, fine sandy loam, cobbly loam,\ncobbly fine sandy loam, stony loam, or stony fine sandy loam.\nContent of coarse fragments of sandstone range from 5 to 60\npercent by volume. About 0 to 25 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 5 to 35 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter. Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and\nchroma 3 to 8. Texture is cobbly fine sandy loam, cobbly loam, cobbly clay loam, and cobbly sandy clay loam. Content of coarse fragment of sandstone range from 20 to 60 percent by volume. About 5 to 25 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 15 to 35 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter. Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and\nchroma of 4 to 8. Texture is gravelly or very gravelly clay loam, gravelly or very gravelly sandy clay loam, gravelly or very gravelly loam, cobbly clay loam, cobbly sandy clay loam, or cobbly loam. Content of coarse fragments of sandstone range from 35 to 75 percent by volume. About 20 to 45 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 15 to 30 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.

Texture is similar to the B2t horizon, but includes very cobbly loam, very cobbly clay loam, or very cobbly sandy clay loam. Content of coarse fragments of sandstone range from 55 to 85 percent by volume. About 30 to 45 percent by volume is less than 76 mm in diameter and 25 to 40 percent by volume is more than 76 mm in diameter.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wilburton soils are on very gently sloping to moderately steep uplands in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges. They formed in loamy colluvium and alluvium. Slopes are 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 56 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 61 degrees to 64 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices are greater than 64."

Avilla soils formed in loamy alluvium and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Caston soils formed in loamy colluvium on benches and footslopes, and have less than 35 percent base saturation. Ceda and Dela soils do not have argillic horizons and are on flood plains. In addition, Dela soils have a coarse-loamy control section. Kenn soils are on flood plains and have a gravelly discontinuity. Mena soils formed in pedisediments and old alluvium. Octavia soils formed in loamy colluvium over clay on colluvial benches and footslopes, and have less than 35 percent base saturation in the control section. Sallisaw soils are on similar areas."
