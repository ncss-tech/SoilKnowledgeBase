  "STATES": "AR,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilburton series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in loamy colluvium and alluvium. These soils are on very gently sloping to moderately steep uplands in the valleys of the Ouachita Mountains and the Arkansas Valley and Ridges. Slope ranges from 1 to 20 percent. Mean annual temperature is 63 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 46 inches.",

In addition, Dela soils have a coarse-loamy control section. Kenn soils are on flood plains and have a gravelly discontinuity. Mena soils formed in pedisediments and old alluvium. Octavia soils formed in loamy colluvium over clay on colluvial benches and footslopes, and have less than 35 percent base saturation in the control section. Sallisaw soils are on similar areas."
