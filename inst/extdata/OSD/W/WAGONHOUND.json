  "OVERVIEW": "The Wagonhound series consists of very deep well drained soils on upland hillslopes.  These soils formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from various sources.  Slopes are 3 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 centimeters (15 inches).  Mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location.",
