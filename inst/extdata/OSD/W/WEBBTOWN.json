  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Webbtown series are dominantly moderately deep and well drained.  They formed in residuum derived from a mixture of shale, limestone, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone.  Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches and mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 72 inches.  Depth to hard shale, limestone, or fine-grained sandstone bedrock ranges from 20 to 72 inches or more.  Rock fragment content, commonly shale and porous, very low density soft siltstone, ranges from 15 to 35 percent in the A horizon, from 35 to 75 percent in the B horizon, and from 50 to 80 percent in the C horizon, where present.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and upper part of the B horizon and from moderately acid to neutral in the lower part of the B horizon and in the C horizon.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 1OYR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 5YR to 1OYR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay in the fine earth fraction.  Silty clay and clay textures are limited to the lower part of the B horizon.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the B horizon. Texture ranges from silt loam to clay in the fine earth fraction.  Some pedons have reddish colors inherited from bedrock."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Webbtown soils are on gently sloping to very steep uplands in the Appalachian Ridges and Valleys.  Slopes range from 2 to 60 percent.  Rock outcrops are common in many areas.  These soils formed in residuum weathered from heterogeneous rock composed of interbedded shale, limestone, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone.  The bedrock has dips that range from about 45 degrees to 90 degrees.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 40 inches."

All of these soils have a continuous argillic horizon and less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  In addition, Hagerstown and Poplimento soils are clayey, Nicholson soils have a fragipan, Pagebrook soils are clayey and moderately well drained, and Timberville soils have thick surface layers and are in slight depressions and at the heads of drains."

A small acreage is used for apple and peach orchards, corn, and other row crops.  These soils probably developed under deciduous forest vegetation.  Most areas have been cleared at some time in the past."
