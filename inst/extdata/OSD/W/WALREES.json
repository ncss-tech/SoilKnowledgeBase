  "OVERVIEW": "The Walrees series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in medium and moderately fine textured alluvium underlain by sand, pebbles, and cobbles. These soils are on flood plains and low river terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 8 inches (203 mm) and average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F (12 degrees C).",

Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in alluvium of mixed origin or in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, and quartzite. Elevation is 4,600 to 6,000 feet (1402 to 1829 meters). The climate is arid or semiarid. Average annual precipitation is 5 to 10 inches (127 to 254 mm). Average annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F (10 to 13 degrees C).

These soils are subject to occasional or frequent brief periods of flooding between June and September.\nUSE AND VEGETATION: Used for irrigated crops and pasture, and wildlife habitat. The present vegetation is inland saltgrass, alkali sacaton, fourwing saltbush, Russian-olive, and Fremont cottonwood.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT: Northwestern New Mexico and Southwestern Colorado in the San Juan and Chama River valleys. The series is of small extent. MLRA's 35 and 36.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE: Phoenix, Arizona\nSERIES ESTABLISHED: San Juan County, New Mexico, Eastern Part, 1977.\nREMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nEntisol feature - the lack of diagnostic surface and subsurface horizons due to continual deposition of fresh sediments and very young soil age\nFluventic feature - alluvial stratification and an irregular organic carbon distribution\nUstic soil moisture regime - the presence of sufficient soil moisture for the ustic regime due to capillary rise above the seasonal high water table and the overbank flooding from perennial streams in summer months.\nOxyaquic subgroup - saturation due to the presence of a seasonal high water table between 24 and 60 inches for more than 1 month in most years. Reduction is assumed not to occur due to the presence of moving, oxygenated groundwater within a very coarse textured substratum that lacks much organic matter. Redox depletions or reduced matrices are not present within the fine-loamy upper portion of the particle-size control section in most pedons.\nContrasting particle-size class - the presence of sandy or sandy-skeletal material within 40 inches of the soil surface (2C horizon)\nNote: The classification was changed in 1993 from Aquic Ustifluvents to Oxyaquic Ustifluvents. The Walrees series was mapped with a depth to water table of 2 to 5 feet in the soil survey of San Juan County, New Mexico, Eastern Part. It was mapped with a water table depth of 2 to 4 feet in the soil survey of Rio Arriba County Area, New Mexico. This soil may be moderately well drained where it occurs with a water table depth between 42 and 60 inches (3.5 to 5 ft.). These somewhat drier soils may not have enough natural soil moisture in the soil moisture control section during the warmer months of the year to qualify for the Ustic soil moisture regime, and therefore would be better classified in the new subgroup of Oxyaquic Torrifluvents.\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy 11th  Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
