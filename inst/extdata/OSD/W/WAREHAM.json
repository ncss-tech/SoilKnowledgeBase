  "OVERVIEW": "The Wareham series consists of very deep, poorly and somewhat poorly drained sandy soils formed in outwash on plains, deltas, and terraces.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Permeability is rapid throughout. Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

Below 36 inches the gravel content ranges from 0 to 60 percent and cobblestones range from 0 to 3 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout unless limed.\nThe A horizon, or Ap where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Dry value is 5 or less.  It is sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Structure is weak fine or medium granular or the horizon is single grain.  Consistence is very friable or loose.  Some pedons have E horizons with hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bw or Bg horizons where present have a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, or sand.  Structure is weak fine or medium granular or subangular blocky, or the horizon is single grain.  Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand in the fine earth fraction.  Some pedons have strata of sand and gravel below a depth of 40 inches, and some have lenses or bodies of fine sandy loam.  Within a depth of 20 inches chroma is either 2 or less, when hue is 10YR or redder, or 3 or less, when hue is 2.5Y or 5Y.  The Cg horizon is massive or single grain in the upper part and single grain in the lower part.  Consistence is very friable or loose."

Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 7 inches (A horizon).\n2.  Aquic conditions as evidenced by a matrix chroma of 2 and redox concentrations within a layer between 16 and 20 inches from the mineral soil surface (C1 horizon).\n3. Humaqueptic subgroup  color value, moist of 3 and color value, dry of 5 in the upper 15 cm. (A horizon) and base saturation generally averages less than 25 percent within 100 cm. in similar soils."
