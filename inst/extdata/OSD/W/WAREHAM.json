  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 6 to 30 inches. Gravel content to a depth of about 40 inches ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  Below 36 inches the gravel content ranges from 0 to 60 percent and cobblestones range from 0 to 3 percent.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid throughout unless limed.\nThe A horizon, or Ap where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Dry value is 5 or less.  It is sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Structure is weak fine or medium granular or the horizon is single grain.  Consistence is very friable or loose.  Some pedons have E horizons with hue 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are sand or loamy sand.\nThe Bw or Bg horizons where present have a hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, or sand.  Structure is weak fine or medium granular or subangular blocky, or the horizon is single grain.  Consistence is very friable or loose.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand in the fine earth fraction.  Some pedons have strata of sand and gravel below a depth of 40 inches, and some have lenses or bodies of fine sandy loam.  Within a depth of 20 inches chroma is either 2 or less, when hue is 10YR or redder, or 3 or less, when hue is 2.5Y or 5Y.  The Cg horizon is massive or single grain in the upper part and single grain in the lower part.  Consistence is very friable or loose."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wareham soils are level to gently sloping soils on outwash plains, deltas, and stream terraces in areas that receive run on water.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial materials derived from granite and gneiss.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 40 to 47 inches.  Mean growing season ranges from 120 to 200 days."

Ochric epipedon - from 0 to 7 inches (A horizon).\n2.  Aquic conditions as evidenced by a matrix chroma of 2 and redox concentrations within a layer between 16 and 20 inches from the mineral soil surface (C1 horizon).\n3. Humaqueptic subgroup  color value, moist of 3 and color value, dry of 5 in the upper 15 cm. (A horizon) and base saturation generally averages less than 25 percent within 100 cm. in similar soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
