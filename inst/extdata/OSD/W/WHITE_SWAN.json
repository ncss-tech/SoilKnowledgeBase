    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at 20 inches ranges from 50 to 55 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches.  The natric horizon contain 35 to 45 percent clay and more than 15 percent exchangeable sodium in some part.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist.  It is silt loam to fine sandy loam, and is mildly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay and structure is strong to moderate prismatic. It is moderately to very strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam with thin strata of very fine sandy loam or fine sandy loam and is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Couch, Standish, Tomera, and Uvada soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Couch and Uvada soils have E horizons.  Standish soils have weakly cemented strata in the C horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  White Swan soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces at elevations of 850 to 1,050 feet.  They formed in loess over lacustrine sediments.  These soils are in a climate with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The average January temperature is 29 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 73 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is 130 to 180 days."

    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is used for range.  Vegetation is greasewood, saltgrass and sagebrush.  In most irrigated areas the soil has been somewhat altered by deep tillage, minimizing the adverse effect of the natric horizon.  Irrigated crops grown after this alteration include sugar beets, small grain, corn, and improved pasture."
