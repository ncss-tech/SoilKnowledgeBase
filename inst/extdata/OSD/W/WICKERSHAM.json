These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. Clay content in the upper part of the control section averages from 6 to 18 percent.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section ranges from 5 to 25 percent in the upper part and from 40 to 70 percent in the lower part by weighted average.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  It is silt loam, loam, gravelly loam, or channery loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 5 to 25 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or N, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry.  It is very channery or extremely channery loamy sand or sand. Rock content ranges from 40 to 70 percent."

Assumed a lack of andic soil properties because of lack of reddish hue and smearyness.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an ochric epipedon from 2 to 9 inches, a cambic horizon from 9 to 26 inches and a lithologic discontinuity to sandy-skeletal material at 26 inches."
