  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The surface mineral horizons range from 16 to 40 inches thick.  The underlying organic horizons range from 8 to more than 80 inches thick.  The soil ranges from extremely to strongly acid throughout, except where the surface has been limed.  Common fine flakes of mica occur throughout the mineral part of the soil.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, or silt.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7, chroma of 1 or 2.   It is silt, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loamy very fine sand.  Silt plus very fine sand content in the 10 to 40 inch control section ranges from 80 to 95 percent with less than 5 percent clay.  Thin strata of sand or fine sand that has chroma of 3 may occur in some pedons.  Stratified layers of organic material or organic coated sand range from none to common in the Cg horizon.  The low chroma colors represent redox depletions caused by wetness.  Some pedons have few to common high chroma masses of iron accumulation in the Cg horizon.\nThe 2Oa horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The organic material ranges from weak blocky structure in the upper layers to massive in the lower layers.  Stumps, logs, pockets of ash, and fragments of charcoal are common throughout the 2Oa horizon of most pedons.\nThe Ab or 3Cg horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, sandy loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or loamy fine sand and their mucky modifiers"

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wysocking soils are on nearly level surfaces around Lake Mattamuskeet in eastern North Carolina, and possibly around other large lakes in the Lower Coastal Plain.  They formed in silty marine, fluvial, and possibly aeolian sediments deposited over organic material.   Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Elevations range from 1 to 10 feet above sea level.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 61 to 65 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from about 50 to 55."

Belhaven, Ponzer, and Scuppernong soils have organic material at the surface.  Engelhard, Hydeland, Pasquotank, and Weeksville soils are mineral soils but lack buried organic horizons.  Fortescue soils have an umbric epipedon.  All these soils are on broad, nearly level landscape positions."
