  "OVERVIEW": "The Waupecan series consists of very deep, well drained soils on outwash plains and stream terraces. They formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash and are deep to sandy and gravelly deposits. Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

The depth to horizons with more than 15 percent sand is 61 to 122 cm (24 to 48 inches). The depth to horizons with more than 15 percent rock fragments and 75 percent sand ranges from 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches). The particle-size control section averages from 25 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is slightly acid or neutral except pedons that have been limed include slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon or a BA horizon.\nThe Bt or BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. It typically is silty clay loam, but some subhorizons range to silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt or 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 through 5; and chroma of 3 through 6. It is clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam, sandy loam, loamy sand, or their gravelly analogs with some pedons being stratified. Most pedons have a subhorizon just above a coarser textured layer that contains an enrichment of clay or organic carbon. One or more subhorizons contain 5 percent or more gravel, but these soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 3 through 6; and chroma of 3 through 6. It ranges from very gravelly sandy loam to sand and gravel with some pedons being stratified. Some pedons contain as much as 35 percent cobbles. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline and contains carbonates in some part within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches)."

The Bowes, Batavia, and Longlois soils are closer to drainageways on similar parts of the landscape. Batavia and Longlois soils, like Bowes, have a dark colored surface layer less than 25 cm (10 inches) in thickness. In addition, Batavia soils contain less than 15 percent gravel in the lower part or the series control section, and Longlois soils contain 15 percent or more fine sand or coarser sand in the particle-size control section. Plano and Wea soils are on similar parts of the landscape nearby. Wea soils average more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser in the particle-size control section. Troxel soils have a mollic epipedon more than 51 cm (20 inches) thick and are in shallow depressions and concave parts of the outwash plains and stream terraces. The poorly drained Drummer and somewhat poorly drained Elburn soils are on lower parts of the landform nearby. Warsaw soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size class and are on similar parts of the landform nearby."
