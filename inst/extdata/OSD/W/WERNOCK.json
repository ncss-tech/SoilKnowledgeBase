  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to soft sandstone, siltstone or shale ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Reaction ranges from neutral to extremely acid.  Small sandstone, siltstone, or shale fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume to a depth of about 24 inches; below 24 inches fragments from 2 mm.  to 15 inches across range from few to more than 50 percent.\nThe A horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some pedons have Ap horizons 4 to 10 inches thick.\nThe AB horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 though 6 and chroma of 2 though 6.\nWhen present, the BA horizon has hues of 10YR or 7.5YR, values of 4 through 6, chromas of 4 or 6.  The texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizons have hues of 10YR through 5YR, values of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8, with mottles in shades of brown or red. Some pedons have mottles in shades of gray below 2Y inches.  The texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam or clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hues 10YR through 5YR, values of 4 through 6 and chroma of 2 through 8.  The texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  Weathered sandstones, siltstones, or shale which is often interbedded and colors are in shades of gray, red, or brown.  The bedrock is most often soft, but in some areas the thick bedded sandstones or siltstones are hard below a depth of 40 inches.\nThe Cr horizon has hues of 5YR to 5Y, values of 3 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chillum, Fletcher, Kurtz, Taleyville, and Whitley series.  The Chillum soils have thinner sola and lack the mottling in the lower part of the B2t horizon.  Fletcher soils lack the mottling in the lower part of the B2t horizon and have formed in the weathered residuum of phyllite.  The Kurtz soils have soft siltstone and shale bedrock at a depth of 40 to 55 inches.  Talleyville soils have thicker sola and have formed in a silty mantle overlying weathered residuum from basic igneous rocks.  Whitley soils are more than than 40 inches to bedrock, lack the mottling in the lower part of the B2t horizon and have formed in a mantle of wind or water sorted material overlying weathered residuum of siltstone, sandstone or shale.\nThe Wellston series is in a related family.  Wellston soils have base saturation of more than 35 percent and bedrock of 40 inches or more; otherwise, they are close competitors."
