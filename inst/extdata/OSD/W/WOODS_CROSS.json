    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: A layer of peat 1 1/2 to 3 inches thick is at the surface in many places.  Reaction is mildly alkaline to neutral and the soil is noncalcareous or slightly calcareous. Texture of the 10 to 40 inch control section is silty clay or heavy silty clay loam. The soil is saturated at 1 to 2 feet, unless drained,\nThe A horizon has hues of 10YR and 2.5Y, values of 3 or 4 dry, and 2 or 3 moist, and chromas of 1 or less. Distinct redoximorphic concentrations are within 30 inches of the surface. The A horizon contains 4 to 10 percent organic matter.\nThe C horizon has hues of 2.5Y or 5Y, values of 4 through 7 dry, and 2 through 5 moist, and chromas of 2 or less. Texture is dominantly silty clay or silty clay loam, but the horizon contains thin lenses of coarser material ln some places. Buried A horizons are common."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Woods Cross soils are on smooth to slightly undulating, nearly level to gently sloping, broad alluvial fans and flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The soils have formed in alluvium and lake sediments derived from gneiss, schist, granite, quartzite and sandstone. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., the average summer temperature from 65 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free season from 120 to 175 days. The average annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 18 inches."
