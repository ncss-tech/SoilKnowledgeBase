  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Waca soils are on gently sloping to very steep mountains. Elevations range from 1825 to 2740 meters and down to 1675 meters on some north aspects. These soils formed in material weathered from andesitic tuff breccia. Most of the soils have formed in materials weathered from mudflows or debris flows of the Merhten Formation. The climate is humid to subhumid with warm dry summers and cold wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 580 to 2035 mm, most of which occurs as snow. Mean annual temperature is 3 to 9 degrees C. Mean January temperature is -1 degrees C, mean July temperature is 16 degrees C. Frost-free season is 25 to 100 days."

Campone, Lyonman and Tourn soils have mollic epipedons. Longval soils have mixed mineralogy and less than 35 percent rock fragments in the textural control section. Sky and Melody soils have a cryic temperature regime and Melody soils are less than 50 cm to bedrock. All these soils are on similar landforms."
