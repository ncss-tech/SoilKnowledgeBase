  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist and it is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for less than 45 consecutive days during the four months following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer soil temperature is less than 59 degrees F without an O horizon.  Depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, more than 5.5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam, with 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments, mostly gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent gravel and angular cobbles.  It is massive or has weak structure.  The bedrock is hard and may be slightly to highly fractured."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winberry soils are on mountain slopes and ridge tops in the Cascade Range at elevations of 3,200 to 4,700 feet.  Slopes are 10 to 70 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium weathered from light colored dacitic and andesitic tuffs and breccias.  Winters are cold and moist and summers are cool and dry.  The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches, much of which falls as snow from November to May.  The mean January temperature is 31 degrees F; the mean July temperature is 59 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

Cruiser soils are deeper than 40 inches to bedrock and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Hummington, Keel, and Yellowstone soils have an umbric epipedon 10 inches or more thick.  Holderman soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock."
