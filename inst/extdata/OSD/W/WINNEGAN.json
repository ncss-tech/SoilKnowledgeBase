In areas that have been cultivated the Ap horizon has color value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, loam or clay loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has color value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 but may be mixed with the A horizon in eroded pedons. It typically is loam or clay loam, but silt loam is within the range. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam or clay loam and very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8, ranging to 8 rarely.
