  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Masses of soft calcium carbonate commonly are in the lower part of the solum and occur within depths of 24 to 40 inches. Rock fragments range from 1 to 5 percent throughout.\nThe A horizon has color value of 2 to 5, 4 to 7 dry and chroma of 2 or 3. In areas that have been cultivated the Ap horizon has color value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, loam or clay loam.  Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has color value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 but may be mixed with the A horizon in eroded pedons. It typically is loam or clay loam, but silt loam is within the range. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe BE horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is loam or clay loam and very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8, ranging to 8 rarely. It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay and more than 20 percent sand. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the upper part and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part. Some pedons have Btk horizons.\nThe BC and C horizon typically has hue of 2.5Y to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is clay or clay loam in the upper part and clay loam or loam in the lower part. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

Brookside soils have more than 5 pecent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section.  Losantville soils have carbonates at depths of less than 20 inches.  Miamian soils have dense till at depths of less than 40 inches.  Purdin soils have color value and chroma of 3 or less in the A or Ap horizon. Shircliff soils have less than 10 percent sand in the argillic horizon.  Vincent soils do not have rock fragments in the upper part of the series control section and have hue redder than 7.5YR in the lower part of the argillic horizon."

The somewhat porly drained Gorin and Keswick soils have 2 chroma mottles within 10 inches of the top of the argillic horizon and Gorin soils have a mantle of loess. Both soils are higher on the landscape. The moderately deep, moderately well drained Gosport soils formed in residuum and are lower on the landscape."
