  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 43 to 47 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist, but are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days in late summer.  No bedrock or contrasting layer is above depth of 40 inches.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is silt or silt loam and contains much coarse silt, 12 to 18 percent clay, and less than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand.  The sola are 5 to 11 inches thick.  The entire soil is moderately calcareous with no or only minor distribution of the carbonates except on exterior surfaces of nodules.  The uppr part of the soils range from mildly to moderately alkaline, and the lower part ranges from moderately to strongly alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon, or upper 7 inches when mixed, has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has 0.2 to 1.2 percent organic matter.  In most pedons, the A horizon is moderately calcareous, but in some undisturbed pedons the upper few inches are slightly calcareous.\nThe C1 horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It has more than 20 percent hard or very hard rounded nodules of soil material or krotovinas."

The soils formed in loess.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 11 to 13 inches and the average annual temperature is about 41 to 45 degrees F.  The  frost free season is 80 to 100 days."
