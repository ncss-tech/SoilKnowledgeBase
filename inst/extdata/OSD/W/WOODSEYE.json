  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodseye series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from metamorphic rocks.  Woodseye soils are on gently sloping to very steep mountainside slopes.  The mean annual precipitation is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.  The base saturation is less than 50 percent throughout the profile.  Angular rock fragments less than 3 inches in size range from 35 to 95 percent throughout the profile.  The mean annual soil temperature just above bedrock is between 40 and 46 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature for pedons with 0 horizons is 49 to 53 degrees F., and 59 to 62 degrees F. for pedons without 0 horizons.  These soils are usually continually moist, but are dry throughout from about the later part of July until the later part of September.\nThe A horizon has colors of 10YR 4/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/2 or 4/3.  It is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, or light loam and is modified by 35 to 70 percent angular gravel.\nThe B horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is sandy loam or loam with 18 to 27 percent clay.  It has 35 to 80 percent rock fragments.\nThe C horizon has colors of 10 YR 5/3, 4/3, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6 or 7.5YR 5/4 or 5/6.  It is sandy loam, loam or heavy loam and is modified by 50 to 95 percent angular gravel."

They are at elevations of 6,000 to 9,000 feet in California and 3,000 to 5,500 feet in Oregon.  Underlying bedrock is consolidated metasedimentary or metavolcanic rocks.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and hot, dry summers.  Mean annual precipitation is typically 50 to 80 inches most of which occurs as snow, but may range to 100 inches in high winter rainfall interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon.  Average January temperature is 25 degrees F.; average July temperature is 64 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 38 to 46 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 25 to 100 days."
