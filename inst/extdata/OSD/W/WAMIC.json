  "OVERVIEW": "The Wamic series consists of deep, well-drained soils that formed in mixed loess and ash over alluvium and colluvium weathered from basalt or andesite.  These soils are on uplands.  Slopes are to 70 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 80 consecutive days in more than 7 out of 10 years throughout the moisture control section.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum and depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 24 to 36 inches and depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches.  The control section has 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 18 percent coarser than very fine sand.  The solum has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR.  The solum is estimated to have a volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent and acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is very fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  This horizon has weak granular or subangular blocky structure.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is loam or silt loam.\nThe C1 horizon, where present, is massive and has few to common very firm noncalcareous nodules 1/2 to 3/4 inch in diameter and is similar to the B horizon in texture.  The 2C horizon is heavy loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 20 to 30 percent clay.  It is very hard or extremely hard and firm or very firm.  This horizon has brown or reddish brown, moderately thick or thick clay films mostly in pores and fractures but distributed throughout the mass in some pedons."

The soils formed in mixed volcanic ash and loess over medium or moderately fine textured alluvium or colluvium weathered from basalt or andesite.  The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers.  The mean July temperature is 63 degrees F.; the mean January temperature is 37 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 25 inches."

Bald soils are loamy-skeletal and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact.  Bodell soils are grassland soils, have mollic epipedons and are less than 20 inches deep to a lithic contact. Frailey soils are coarse-loamy, have more than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section and lack firm or very hard 2C horizons above depth of 40 inches.  Hesslan soils have mollic epipedons, are commonly stony, and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Skyline soils have mollic epipedons and are less than 20 inches to a paralithic contact."
