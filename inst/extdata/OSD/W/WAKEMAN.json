Herkimer, Lowville, and Pittsfield soils do not have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Reger and Urne soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Spoolsville soils have a paralithic contact between 102 and 152 cm (40 and 60 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wakeman soils are on bedrock controlled landforms on till plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent. The soils formed in residuum over sandstone bedrock. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 914 mm (27 to 36 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 5 to 11 degrees C (42 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 165 days. Elevation is 183 to 259 meters (600 to 850 feet) above mean sea level."

All of the associated soils are very deep, except Dekalb and Mitiwanga soils which are moderately deep. The somewhat poorly drained Bennington and Mitiwanga soils, and the moderately well drained Cardington are on less sloping or lower lying areas on till plains. The Dekalb soils are loamy-skeletal and on similar landscape positions. The somewhat poorly drained Jimtown, well drained Oshtemo, and moderately well drained Rawson soils are on beach ridges of lake plains."
