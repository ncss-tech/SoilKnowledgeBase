  "OVERVIEW": "The Wahpeton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey alluvium.  These soils are on levees and low terraces of large streams and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 19 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section typically averages between 50 to 60 percent clay, but ranges from 35 to 60 percent.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 40 inches in thickness.  The soil commonly has one or more Ab horizons separated by C horizons below depths of 24 inches.  Many pedons when dry have cracks which extend from the surface to depths of 60 inches or more.  Slickensides are in the lower half of most pedons.  Some pedons do not have carbonates to depths of 36 inches and do not have segregated carbonates below these depths.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  Some pedons have chroma of 2 moist in the lower part of the A horizon when the soil is crushed.  It is clay or silty clay.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.  The lower boundary of the A horizon ranges from gradual or clear smooth to irregular and tongued.  Some pedons have a Bw or Bk horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.   It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ab horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or are neutral, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or less.  They are clay, silty clay or silty clay loam.  They are neutral or slightly alkaline."

Slope gradients commonly are less than 2 percent but some on levee and terrace edges range to 15 percent.  The soil formed in clayey alluvium.  The climate is cool, subhumid.  The mean annual air temperatures range from 36 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 16 to 23 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

Bearden and Overly soils are on higher elevations on the nearby lake plains.  They are fine-silty.  Cashel, Fairdale and La Prairie soils are on flood plains and low terraces that are lower on the landscape than the Wahpeton soils.  Cashel soils do not have mollic epipedons.  Fairdale and La Prairie soils are fine-loamy.  The poorly drained Dovray, Fargo and Hegne soils are on nearby glacial lake plains.  Dovray and Fargo soils have Bw horizons.  Hegne soils have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches."
