  "OVERVIEW": "The Webbridge series consists of deep, well-drained soils that formed in a mantle of volcanic ash over colluvium from basalt.  Webbridge soils are on 35 to 75 percent canyon slopes. Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
