  "OVERVIEW": "The Watusi series consists of moderately deep, well drained moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in alluvium derived from basalt.  These soils are on basalt flows and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is 48 to 51 degrees F.",
