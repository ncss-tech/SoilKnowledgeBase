    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  In most years the soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for more than 60 consecutive days within the 4-month period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 34 inches thick and includes all or part of the Bw horizon. Hue is 10YR or 7.5YR throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 1 to 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It is silt loam, loam or gravelly silt loam with 0 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 2 to 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is loam, silt loam, gravelly silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay.  It has 0 to 25 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. It is neutral to moderately alkaline."

The soils formed in reworked loess and volcanic ash and colluvium weathered from basalt. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 24 inches.  The mean summer temperature is 64 degrees F.  The mean winter temperature is 30 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period (32 degrees F.) is 100 to 170 days and for (28 degrees F.) it is 170 to 200 days."
