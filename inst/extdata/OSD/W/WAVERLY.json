  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is greater than 24 inches thick. The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, except where the surface layer has been limed. Brown and black concretions are few to many throughout the solum.  The 10- to 40-inch control section has 5 to 18 percent clay.\nThe Ap or the A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2, or value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1; masses of oxidized iron in shades of yellow or brown are few to common. Texture is silt or silt loam.\nThe BCg or Cg horizon has the same range in color as the Bg horizon.  Textures are silt, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a buried A and B horizon below a depth of 20 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Falaya series in the same family. Closely related series in other families are the Arkabutla, Bibb, Convent, Gillsburg, Kinston, Mantachie, Mhoon, and Rosebloom series. Arkabutla, Kinston, and Mantachie soils have a fine-loamy particle-size class; also, Arkabutla soils have higher chroma in the upper part of the B horizon, and Kingston and Mantachie soils have siliceous mineralogy. Bibb soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size class and siliceous mineralogy. Convent, Falaya, and Gillsburg soils have a subhorizon with higher chroma in the upper part of the B horizon; also, Convent soils have a nonacid reaction class and formed entirely in Mississippi River alluvium. Mhoon and Rosebloom soils have a fine-silty particle-size class; also, Mhoon soils have a nonacid reaction class and formed entirely in Mississippi River alluvium."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans. Slope gradients mainly are less than 1 percent but range to 2 percent along streams that drain the Southern Mississippi Valley Silty Uplands Major Land Resource Area. Waverly soils formed in silty alluvium derived mainly from loess of low sand content. The climate is warm and humid. Average annual temperature is about 65 degrees Fahrenheit, and average annual precipitation is about 54 inches near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the closely related Falaya and Rosebloom soils, and Collins soils. The somewhat poorly drained Falaya soils are on slightly higher parts of the floodplain, and the poorly drained Rosebloom soils are in similar positions as the Waverly soils. The moderately well drained Collins soils are on slightly higher flood plain positions near channels, bedding planes in the upper 20 inches and do not have a cambic horizon."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Poorly drained, slow runoff; moderate permeability. Areas in depressions are ponded during wet seasons. The water table is at or within one foot of the surface during the winter and spring months in normal years. These soils are subject to occasional or frequent flooding for brief to long duration after heavy rainfall."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of the Waverly soils are in bottomland hardwoods. Principal trees are sweetgum, cherrybark oak, willow oak, water oak, nutall oak, pin oak, eastern cottonwood, American sycamore, loblolly pine, water tupelo and cypress. Cleared areas are used for growing cotton, corn, soybeans, hay\ncrops or pasture."
