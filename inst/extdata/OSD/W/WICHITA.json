  "OVERVIEW": "The Wichita series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy and clayey alluvium. These soils are on nearly level to gently sloping uplands. Slopes are mainly 0 to 1 percent but range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 686 mm (27 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
