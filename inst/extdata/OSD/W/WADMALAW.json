  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the A horizon and moderately acid to moderately alkaline throughout the rest of the profile.  In some pedons there are a few ferromagnesian concretions in one or more horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 1.  The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. The AB or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown.  The A and E horizons are fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles in shades of brown are in most pedons.  The B horizon commonly is sandy clay loam or fine sandy loam, but some pedons are sandy clay or clay loam below a depth of about 40 inches."
