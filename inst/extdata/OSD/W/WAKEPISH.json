The upper 7 to 14 inches is 30 to 60 percent volcanic ash and cinders.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout.  Some profiles contain woody organic debris, composed of logs, branches, and bark.\nThe C1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 moist, 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 0 to 3 moist and dry.  Some areas have a stony or bouldery surface.  Some areas have a cindery surface layer.\nThe C2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 0 to 3 moist and dry.

Wakepish soils formed in mud flow material from the May 18, 1980 eruption of Mt.  St. Helens.  The climate is characterized by warm, moist summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 130 to 140 inches including snowfall.  Average January temperature is 28 degrees F; average July temperature is 61 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 110 days."
