  "STATES": "CT,NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Watchaug series consists of very deep, moderately well drained loamy soils formed in meltout till. They are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on till plains and hills, typically on lower slopes and in slight depressions. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high. Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 36 inches. Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 6 feet. Rock fragments range from 5 to 35 percent by volume throughout the soil. Except where the surface is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded gravel and typically make up 60 percent or more of the total rock fragments. Unless limed, reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR and value and chroma of 2 to 4. Dry value is 6 or more. Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon with value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3. The Ap or A horizon is sandy loam to silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable\nor very friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Redoximorphic features are in the lower part of the Bw above a depth of 24 inches. It is sandy loam to silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. The Bw horizon has weak granular or subangular blocky structure, or it is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin BC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 to 6. It typically has redoximorphic features. Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction. Some pedons have thin lenses of loamy sand. The horizon is massive or it has weak plates. Consistence is commonly very friable or friable but the range includes firm."

Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. The soils formed in acid till derived mostly from reddish sandstone, shale, and conglomerate with some basalt. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52\ndegrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 50 inches, and the growing season ranges from 130 to 185 days."

The well drained Cheshire soils are associated in a drainage sequence. Berlin soils are on lacustrine terraces. Branford, Ellington, Hartford, Manchester, and Penwood soils are on nearby outwash terraces and are underlain by stratified sand or sand and gravel. Holyoke soils have bedrock within a depth of 10 to 20 inches. Well drained Wethersfield soils have a dense substratum. Menlo soils are very poorly drained. Narragansett soils are well drained and have a loamy sand substratum. Rainbow soils have a dense substratum and are 7.5YR or yellower hue in the B horizon. Wapping soils have 7.5YR or yellower in the B horizon."
