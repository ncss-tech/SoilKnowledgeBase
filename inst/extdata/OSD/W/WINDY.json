  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to rock ranges from 40 to greater than 60 inches.  Colors throughout the profile are 10YR 2/2, 3/1, 3/2, 3/3, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/1, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 7.5YR 3/2, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/4 dry.  Moist chroma and value within the upper 20 inches is 1, 2, 3, or 4.  The soil is usually moist continuously in some or all parts of the moisture control section from about November until June and is usually dry in all parts the rest of the year.  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 40 to 47 degrees F.  Volcanic ash is less than 60 percent throughout the upper 7 to 14 inches of the profile.  Bulk density ranges from about 0.85 in the upper part to about 1.0 in the lower part of the profile.\nThe A horizon is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam or coarse sandy loam and may be modified by gravel, stones or cobbles.  Rock fragments range from about 5 to 75 percent.  It is typically medium acid but ranges from slightly acid to strongly acid.  Base saturation ranges from 6 to 35 percent.\nThe Bw horizon is loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam and ranges from gravelly or cobbly to extremely gravelly or extremely cobbly with 35 to 90 percent rock fragments.  It ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.  Base saturation ranges from 2 to 29 percent.  Some pedons have a C horizon."

Sheld soils have buried Bt horizons. Tumac soils have greater than 60 percent volcanic ash in the upper 13 inches of the soil.  Pheeney and Waca soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  Washougal soils have mesic temperature regimes."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Windy soils are on mountains and plateaus in the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range of northern California.  They formed in material weathered from volcanic mud flow, primarily of andesite but including dacite or basalt in some areas.  Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 9,000 feet and annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 80 inches, mostly as winter snow.  Slopes are 5 to 75 percent.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 47 degrees F.  Summers are dry and average July temperature ranges from 56 to 67 degrees F.  Average January temperature ranges from 25 to 32 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."

Pine manzanita, mountain whitethorn, bush chinquapin and huckleberry oak are associated in the dense shrub-covered areas.  Red fir, white fir and Jeffrey pine occur in the conifer-dominated areas."

The present classification is based on an umbric epipedon, a xeric moisture regime, bulk density of about 0.9 and more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section.\nCompeting series not updated at that time.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL pedon S90CA-009-109.  Two pedons in Amador County without andic soil property analyses: S61CA-005-030 and S61CA-005-030. UCD lab pedon #1423.  Windy soils mapped in Tehama County with soil depths of 20 to 40 inches would now be included with the Waca series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
