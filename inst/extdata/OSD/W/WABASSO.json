  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wabasso series consists of very deep, very poorly and poorly drained, that formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments. Wabasso soils are on flatwoods, low broad flats, sloughs, depressions, and flood plains. Slopes are linear to concave and range from 0 to 2 percent. Near the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 1397 millimeters (55 inches), and the mean annual temperature is about 22 degrees C (72 degrees F).",
