Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent to depths greater than\n20 inches.  The soil moisture control section is about 5 to 13 inches.  The soil between the depths of 5 and 13 inches is moist\nin some part from mid-December through May.  The soil temperature\nis above 47 degrees F.  from March through December.  The soil is usually dry in all parts from June 1 to November 1.  The mean\nannual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 63 degrees F.\nThe A, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have dry color of 10YR 5/1 or 4/1.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent.\nThe BCt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1 or 4/1 and moist color\nof 10YR 3/1 or 3/2.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume.

The climate is dry subhumid, mesothermal, with hot, dry summers and cool moist winters.  Average annual precipitation is\n15 to 18 inches.  Mean January temperature is 45 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 78 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 59 degrees to 61 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 200 to 240 days."
