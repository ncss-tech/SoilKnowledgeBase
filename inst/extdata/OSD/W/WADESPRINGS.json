  "OVERVIEW": "The Wadesprings series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from serpentinite, and\nother rocks containing talc and asbestos.  Wadesprings soils are\non uplands and have slopes of 15 to 75 percent.  The average\nannual precipitation is 16 inches and the mean annual temperature\nis 60 degrees F.",

Organic matter ranges from 1 to 3 percent to depths greater than\n20 inches.  The soil moisture control section is about 5 to 13 inches.  The soil between the depths of 5 and 13 inches is moist\nin some part from mid-December through May.  The soil temperature\nis above 47 degrees F.  from March through December.  The soil is usually dry in all parts from June 1 to November 1.  The mean\nannual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 63 degrees F.\nThe A, Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have dry color of 10YR 5/1 or 4/1.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent.\nThe BCt horizon has dry color of 10YR 5/1 or 4/1 and moist color\nof 10YR 3/1 or 3/2.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent by volume.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
