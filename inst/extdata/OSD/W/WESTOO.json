  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The series control section contains up to 3 percent rock fragments.  The depth to carbonates is greater than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section has less than 25 percent medium sand or coarser.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, loamy sand, or loamy very fine sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe E horizon (when present) is as much as 5 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is typically loamy fine sand or fine sand but subhorizons of loamy very fine sand, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam may occur in the upper part. The Bw typically has distinct to prominent Fe concentrations in the lower part.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is typically loamy fine sand or fine sand but thin subhorizons of loamy very fine sand,  fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam may occur. The C or Cg typically has distinct to prominent Fe concentrations that are weakly to moderately cemented in some pedons.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Westoo soils are on convex or linear surfaces of glacial lake plains and outwash plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  They formed in eolian and/or glaciolacustrine materials.  Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches.  The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days.  Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1425 feet."

The somewhat poorly drained Barber, poorly drained Wabuse and very poorly drained Kapla soils are on lower positions. The moderately well drained Lavell soils are on higher positions. Cathro and Rifle soils occur on broad flats and in depressions and formed in organic materials. Vasso, Wabuse and Kapla soils also have loamy materials above 40 inches."

Westoo soils have seasonal high saturation at a depth of 2.5 feet at some time from April through May and October through November in normal years."
