  "OVERVIEW": "The Walti series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Walti soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
