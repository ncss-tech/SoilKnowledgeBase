    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil between the depths of 8 and 24 inches is dry in all parts from mid-April until mid-January and is continuously moist in some parts for 60 to 90 consecutive days in the winter. Mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 67 degrees F. The soil temperature is never below 47 degrees F. in the San Joaquin Valley. Some pedons have disseminated carbonates at depths below 16 to 40 inches. Rock fragment content is 0 to 15 percent. Rock fragments are less than 0.5 inch in diameter. Organic matter is less than 1 percent in the upper part of the profile and decreases regularly with increasing depth. Organic matter content is less than 0.2 percent below 49 inches depth.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 5/2 or 6/2. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2; 2.5Y 4/2 or 5/2. Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 7/2 or 7/4. Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 4/2, 4/3, 5/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4 or 6/2. Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam. Some pedons have thick stratification below a depth of 40 inches with texture of loamy sand to silt loam. Distinct thin stratification is not present. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cantua and Uxo series. Cantua soils (MLRA 15), on uplands, are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact of soft, calcareous sandstone. Uxo soils (MLRA 30), on alluvial fans and fan aprons, are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October following convection storms, have gravel content in the A horizon of 40 to 75 percent and have Btk horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wasco soils are on recent alluvial fans and flood plains. Slope is 0 to 5 percent. These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from igneous and/or sedimentary rock sources. Elevation is 225 to 1,000 feet in the southern part of San Joaquin Valley and cool phases occur at elevations as high as 3,700 feet in the Mojave Desert. The climate is arid to semiarid with hot, dry summers and cool, somewhat moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 4 to 7 inches. Mean January temperature is 44 degrees to 47 degrees F.; mean July temperature is 80 degrees to 85 degrees F.; mean annual temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F. in the Mojave Desert and 62 degrees to 65 degrees F. in the San Joaquin Valley. Frost-free season is 250 to 300 days in the San Joaquin Valley and 210 to 250 days in the Mojave Desert."
