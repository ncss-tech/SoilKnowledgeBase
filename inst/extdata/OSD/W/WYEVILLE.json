  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 50 inches.   Reaction ranges from  moderately acid to neutral in the A horizon and from strongly acid to neutral in the B and C horizons. Rock fragments are absent throughout the soil.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the Ap or A is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bw horizon typically has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR but some pedons have hue of 5YR.  Value is 4 to 7 and chroma is 2 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon less than 5 inches thick with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 3Bt horizon (2Bt horizon in pedons without a loamy transition layer) has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent.\nThe 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy transition layer) has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is typically silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay but in some pedons have thin strata of coarser texture."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wyeville soils are on glacial lake basins, outwash plains, and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Wyeville soils formed in a sandy outwash or eolian mantle and in the underlying  mostly clayey lacustrine deposits.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 47 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brems, Delton, Morocco, Plainfield, Wautoma soils and the Meehan soils.  The moderately well drained Brems and the somewhat poorly drained Morocco and the excessively drained Plainfield soils occupy nearby positions where the sandy deposits are at least 5 feet thick.  The Wautoma soils have clayey deposits at a similar depth as Wyeville but are poorly drained or very poorly drained and in lower lying positions.  The Meehan soils are sandy throughout and are classified as frigid but associated with Wyeville soils in some places near the 47 degrees F temperature line."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  The potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Permeability is  rapid in the sandy mantle and slow or very slow in the clayey lacustrine deposits.  These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet for some time in most years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of this soil are used for cropland.  Common are corn, small grain, and hay.  Some areas are used for pastureland or woodland.  Native vegetation is mixed coniferous and deciduous forests with red maple, silver maple, green ash, and jack pine predominating."

(Data for these samples, S77WI-001-008 and S77WI-001-009, are not in the NSSL database.)\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - 23 inches (Ap, Bw1, Bw2);argillic horizon - 23 to 27 inches (2Bt);\nAquic feature - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less and saturation in one or more horizons within 75 cm of the soil surface;\nArenic feature - sandy particle-size class throughout a layer extending from the mineral soil surface to the top of the argillic horizon at a depth of 50 cm or more.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
