  "REVDATE": "12/2005",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyeville series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in a sandy outwash or eolian mantle and in the underlying mostly clayey lacustrine deposits on glacial lake basins, outwash plains, and stream and lake terraces.  Permeability is  rapid in the sandy mantle and slow or very slow in the lower mostly clayey lacustrine deposits.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 50 inches.   Reaction ranges from  moderately acid to neutral in the A horizon and from strongly acid to neutral in the B and C horizons. Rock fragments are absent throughout the soil.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture of the Ap or A is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bw horizon typically has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR but some pedons have hue of 5YR.  Value is 4 to 7 and chroma is 2 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt horizon less than 5 inches thick with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 3Bt horizon (2Bt horizon in pedons without a loamy transition layer) has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 55 percent.\nThe 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy transition layer) has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Texture is typically silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay but in some pedons have thin strata of coarser texture."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Brems, Delton, Morocco, Plainfield, Wautoma soils and the Meehan soils.  The moderately well drained Brems and the somewhat poorly drained Morocco and the excessively drained Plainfield soils occupy nearby positions where the sandy deposits are at least 5 feet thick.  The Wautoma soils have clayey deposits at a similar depth as Wyeville but are poorly drained or very poorly drained and in lower lying positions.  The Meehan soils are sandy throughout and are classified as frigid but associated with Wyeville soils in some places near the 47 degrees F temperature line."

Permeability is  rapid in the sandy mantle and slow or very slow in the clayey lacustrine deposits.  These soils have an apparent seasonal high water table at a depth of 1 to 2.5 feet for some time in most years."
