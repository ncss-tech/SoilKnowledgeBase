  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils are usually calcareous throughout but may be leached for a few inches in some pedons. Content of organic carbon ranges from .2 to .8 percent in the surface horizons and decreases irregularly with depth. Conductivity ranges from less than 1 to about 2 millimhos and is variable from strata to strata. Exchangeable sodium percentage ranges from less than 1 to 4 percent and is variable with depth. Cation exchange capacity ranges from 70 to 100 milliequivalents per 100 grams of clay. The weighted average texture of the control section is typically clay or silty clay but clay content ranges from 35 to 50 percent, silt from 20 to 50 percent, and sand from 10 to 40 percent. Content of coarse fragments is usually less than 5 percent and ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 degrees to 51 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 degrees to 68 degrees F. The A horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR, value of 6 or 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has fine granular primary structure in virgin areas usually subangular blocky structure where tilled. This horizon is soft to slightly hard. It is moderately to strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.6).  The C horizon has hue of 5Y through 10YR. It contains faint to distinct small relic mottling in some pedons. This horizon is moderately to strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to pH 8.6). Visible accumulation of secondary calcium carbonate and calcium sulfate as crystals and concretions may occur at any depth but are not concentrated into continuous horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Winkleman soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping flood plains or the lower ends of alluvial fans. Slope gradients typically range from 0 to about 6 percent. They formed in thick, predominantly fine textured, calcareous, moderately alkaline, parent sediments derived principally from sedimentary rock. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 7 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer months. The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 66 degrees F."
