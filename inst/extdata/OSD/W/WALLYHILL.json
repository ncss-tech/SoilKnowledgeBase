  "OVERVIEW": "The Wallyhill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from schist. The Wallyhill soils are on high hills and mountain slopes of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 930 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 14 degrees C.",
