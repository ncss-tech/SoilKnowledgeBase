  "STATES": "CO,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Windcomb series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium, and residuum derived from siltstone, limestone, and sandstone.  Windcomb soils are on  cuestas, and hills.  Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
