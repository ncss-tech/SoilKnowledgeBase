  "OVERVIEW": "The Whilphang series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tertiary lacustrine sediments with a component of mixed alluvial material.  Whilphang soils are on pediments and pediment remnants overlain by fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
