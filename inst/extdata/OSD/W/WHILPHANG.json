Foxcan soils have a paralithic at 10 to 25 cm and are not moist for 10 to 20 days in the summer. Grina soils have 20 to 35 percent clay in the control section and soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C.  Holborn soils are less than 25 cm to bedrock and contain 18 to 30 percent clay.  Hundraw soils are less than 25 cm to bedrock, contain 5 to 15 percent calcium carbonates and have soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C.  Jackratz soils have 25 to 35 percent clay in the control section.  Puett and Stu soils are not moist in the soil moisture control section for 10 to 20 days between July and October. Tert soils are less than 25 cm to rock and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from lacustrine sediments with a component of mixed alluvial material.  Slopes are 4 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 1,591 to 2,134 meters.  The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 130 days."
