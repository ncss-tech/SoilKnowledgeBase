    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 28 to 60 inches but is commonly 38 to 48 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed.\nThe A or Ap horizons have hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  They are sand, loamy sand, fine sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  It has the same texture range as the A horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 to 8.  Texture is loamy sand or loamy fine sand with a silt plus clay content of 10 to 20 percent.\nThe C horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 8.  Streaks or mottles in shades of yellow or brown are present in some pedons.  The C horizon is sand, fine sand, or coarse sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other known series in this family.  Alaga, Blanton, Buncombe, Eustis, Galestown, Kenansville, Lakeland, Molena, Tarboro, and Troup series are in closely related families.  Alaga, Buncombe, and Lakeland soils lack argillic horizons.  In addition, Lakeland soils contain 5 to 10 percent clay plus silt in the 10- to 40-inch control section and Buncombe soils have mixed mineralogy.   Blanton and Troup soils have sandy loam or sandy clay loam Bt horizons 40 to 80 inches below the surface.  Eustis soils have argillic horizons that extend to depths of 60 inches or more.  Galestown soils have average annual soil temperature of less than 59 degrees F.  Kenansville soils have sandy loam Bt horizons.  Molena and Tarboro soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wakulla soils are nearly level to strongly sloping and are on broad landscapes of the Coastal Plain uplands and stream terraces.  Slope is generally 0 to 6 percent but may ranges to 15 percent.  The soil formed in sandy marine, aeolian, or fluvial Coastal Plain sediments.  Average annual precipitation is 49 inches and mean annual air temperature 62 degrees F. near the type location."

All of these soils are on lower positions on the landscape and have finer textured Bt horizons.   In addition, Wagram soils have loamy argillic horizons and Rains soils are poorly drained."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  About one half of the acreage of Wakulla soils is used for cultivated crops and pasture.  Corn, peanuts, peas, soybeans, tobacco, watermelons, and coastal bermudagrass are common crops.  Native forests are principally loblolly pine, longleaf pine, and hardwoods. The hardwoods are mainly turkey, bluejack, white, post, and blackjack oaks with a few hickories, blackgum, and dogwood."
