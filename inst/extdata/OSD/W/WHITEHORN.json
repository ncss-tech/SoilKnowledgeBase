  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whitehorn soils are in depressional areas in wave-reworked glaciomarine drift plains at elevations of 50 to 350 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash over glaciomarine drift.  Whitehorn soils are in a marine climate with warm dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  Average annual precipitation is 30 to 40 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 160 to 200 days."

None of these soils except the Yelm soils and the competing Labounty soils have an aquic moisture regime.  Birchbay soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Clipper soils have a xeric moisture regime and lack an argillic horizon.  Hale soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal.  Kickerville and Yelm soils are medial..  Whatcom soils are coarse-loamy."
