  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitehorn series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in glaciofluvial deposits with an admixture of loess and volcanic ash over glacialmarine drift.  Whitehorn soils are on wave-reworked glacialmarine drift plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
