  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 54 to 59 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist and are dry less than 45 consecutive days between 4 and 12 inches in the four months following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 30 percent clay and 20 to 30 percent rock fragments.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness is 40 to 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick. The solum is moderately to strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is gravelly loam with 15 to 27 percent clay.  It has 15 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is gravelly clay loam or gravelly silty clay loam with 27 to 35 percent clay.  It has 20 to 35 percent gravel."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing soils.  Soils with similar classification are the Bosland, Carlotta, Coppercreek, Devilscreek, Ettersburg, Hely, Hookton, and Watches series.  Bosland soils are 20 to 40 inches to a lithic contact.  Carlotta and Coppercreek soils have ochric epipedons. Carlotta soils are moderately well drained and very deep to bedrock. Devilscreek and Hookton soils have redox concentrations within the solum.  Ettersburg soils have an umbric epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick.  Hely soils cannot be used to compete due to the age of the official series description.  Watches soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock and have a mean annual soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wedderburn soils are on broad ridgetops and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived dominantly from metasedimentary or metavolcanic rock types of the Dothan Formation.  Elevations are 200 to 1300 feet.  The climate is humid, characterized by warm wet winters and warm moist summers, with fog.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperatures.  The mean annual temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 90 to 130 inches.  The frost-free period is 240 to 300 days."

Bosland, Dulandy, Floras, Guerin, Loeb, Macklyn, and Vondergreen soils occur on adjacent redgetops and side slopes.  Dulandy soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact and are loamy-skeletal.  Floras soils are fine textured.  Guerin soils are 10 to 20 inches deep to a lithic contact and are loamy-skeletal.  Loeb, Macklyn, and Vondergreen soils have argillic horizons.  Zwagg soils are on open grassland areas on adjacent ridgetops and side slopes, are 20 to 40 inches deep to a lithic contact, and are coarse-loamy."
