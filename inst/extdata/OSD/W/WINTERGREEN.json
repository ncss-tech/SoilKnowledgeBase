  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 60 inches or more.  Depth to hard bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the colluvium or alluvium is quite variable and ranges from about three to more than 20 feet, but is dominantly greater than 6 feet.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A, Ap, E, BA, and BE horizons and the upper part of the Bt horizon; and from 0 to 60 percent in the lower part of the Bt horizon and the C horizon.  Rock fragments consist mostly of gravel, cobbles, and stones of igneous and metamorphic rock.  Flakes of mica are in some pedons. The soil is extremely acid through strongly acid unless limed.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Where value is 2 or 3, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  The A horizon has texture of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Ap horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 6.  Where value is 2 or 3, the horizon is less than 6 inches thick.  The Ap horizon has texture of sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Some eroded pedons have a surface layer that is sandy clay loam, clay loam or silty clay loam, and include hue of 5YR.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 6 or 8 with value of 3 limited to individual subhorizons. Some pedons have subhorizons with hue of 5YR.  Some pedons have reticulate mottling in the lower part of the Bt. The Bt is clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay loam, or clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10R or 2.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 6 or 8. Some pedons have hue of 5YR.  Some pedons are mottled or streaked in shades of red, yellow, and brown. This horizon is generally coarser in texture than the Bt and commonly contains a higher content of rock fragments. It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay loam, or clay in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 10R through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or sandy clay in the fine earth fraction.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 10R through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 8, and chroma of 1 through 8.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, clay, or sandy clay in the fine earth fraction."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Christiana, Dunmore, Shottower, and Tumbling soils are in the same family.  Christiana soils formed in marine clays in coastal plain sediments, and do not have fragments of crystalline rock.  Dunmore soils formed ion residuum and have fragments of limestone or dolomite.  Shottower soils formed in alluvium and dominantly have fragments of limestone, shale, siltstone, and sandstone.  Tumbling soils formed in colluvium and have fragments of sandstone, quartz, and shale."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wintergreen soils are on footslopes of ridges, colluvial fans, and adjacent small high stream terraces.  The adjacent high stream terraces are usually too small to recognize as distinctly different landforms. Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  The soils developed in colluvium and alluvium derived dominantly from a mixture of crystalline rocks. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 50 degrees to 57 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 40 to 55 inches."

Brandywine soils have a cambic horizon and a sandy- skeletal particle size control section.  Brevard, Edgemont, Eubanks, and Thurmont soils have a fine-loamy particle size control section. Culpeper and Hayesville soils are in residuum, have a significant clay decrease in the solum and occur on upland landscape positions.  Dyke soils have dark red colors throughout the Bt horizon.  Monongahela and Trego soils have a fragipan. Unison soils have yellowish brown colors throughout.  Zoar soils are moderately well drained."

Crops include corn, small grain, hay, apple and peach orchards, berries, and vegetables.  Natural vegetation consists of mixed hardwoods, dominated by oaks and dogwood, with some hickory, yellow poplar, and Virginia pine."

The 3/99 revision also changes mineralogy class from kaolinitic to mixed based on 11 pedon samples from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (009-1, 009-2, 029-1, 029-2, 125-1, 125-2, 067-1, 067-2, 067-3, 141-1, 141-2).  This soil is also placed in the subactive CEC activity class based on data from these samples.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon from 0 to 7 inches (A and E horizons).\n2.  Argillic horizon without significant decrease in clay content from 7 to 62 inches (Bt horizon).\nMLRA=130\nSIR=VA0373, VA0374 (GRAVELLY), VA0375 (STONY)\nREVISED=5/27/92, MHC; 2/99-MKC\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Laboratory data available for 5 pedons from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University;  Pedons VA-125-2, VA-125-13, VA-125-23, VA-125-30, VA-125-70, VA-125-71.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
