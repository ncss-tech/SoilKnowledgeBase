  "OVERVIEW": "The Wagonjacket series consists of soils that are somewhat poorly drained and very deep, that formed in alluvium from volcanic ash and welded tuff.  They are on flood plains.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches380 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C.",
