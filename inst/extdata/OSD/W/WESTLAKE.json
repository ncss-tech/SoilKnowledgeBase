  "OVERVIEW": "The Westlake series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium primarily from loess.   Westlake soils are in flood plains and drainageways, and have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  Permeability is moderately slow.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
