They formed in 56 to 97 cm (22 to 38 inches) of loess and the underlying residuum from siltstone. The bedrock is from the lower part of the Spickert Knob Formation, Borden Group, in Indiana (See Remarks). The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F) and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 105.2 to 305 meters (345 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately well drained Spickert soils have a fragipan and are typically on summits and shoulders. The well drained Wrays soils have a lithic contact and are on similar landform positions as the Wellrock soils."
