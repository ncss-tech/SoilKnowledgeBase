    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bearthicket, Cidermill, Elk, Elkinsville, Olephant, Parke, Pike, Rickert, Tobinsport, and Wellston soils. Bearthicket, Cidermill, Elk, Elkinsville, Olephant, Parke, Pike, Rickert and Tobinsport soils do not have a paralithic contact in the series control section. Wellston soils typically have a lithic contact and average more than 15 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wellrock soils are on moderately sloping and strongly sloping shoulders and backslopes of hills. Slopes range from 6 to 18 percent. They formed in 56 to 97 cm (22 to 38 inches) of loess and the underlying residuum from siltstone. The bedrock is from the lower part of the Spickert Knob Formation, Borden Group, in Indiana (See Remarks). The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F) and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 105.2 to 305 meters (345 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

The moderately deep, well drained Gilwood and Gnawbone soils are typically on shoulders and the upper part of backslopes. The moderately well drained Spickert soils have a fragipan and are typically on summits and shoulders. The well drained Wrays soils have a lithic contact and are on similar landform positions as the Wellrock soils."
