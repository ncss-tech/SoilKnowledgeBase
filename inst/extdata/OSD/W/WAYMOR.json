  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The Waymor series had been classified in the fine-loamy, mixed, mesic family of Typic Hapludalfs.  A re-evaluation of the series concept has placed this series with the fine-loamy, mixed, mesic family of Haplic Glossudalfs.  The expression of the glossic horizon  varies from place to place in delineations of Waymor soils, depending upon the amount of erosion or mixing of horizons by plowing, or both. Some pedons exhibit only coatings, others interfingering, but more pedons, in a random sampling, have tonguing.\n10/04  As described, the 2C1 horizon in the typical pedon has structure, clay films, and roots and appears to be a 2Bt horizon. This would extend the solum to at least 104 (41 inches) and possibly to 119 cm (47 inches), as described. This is thicker than the current series concept. A new typical pedon is needed.\n10/04  The difference in concept between Waymor and Hortonville is unclear. It appears that, at the time of mapping, the concept was that Hortonville had more clay than Waymor in the lower subsoil and in the substratum. However, numerous field descriptions and limited lab data do not show a significant mutually exclusive difference. This revision differentiates the two soils based on the weighted average clay content in the particle-size control section (18-27% for Waymor and 27-35% for Hortonville). The limited lab data available supports this. However, field descriptions do not entirely support this separation. For example, the typical pedon for Waymor in Kewaunee County has textures of silty clay loam and clay loam in the argillic horizon. If the textures are correct, this pedon would average more than 27 percent clay in the argillic. Additional study of these two soils is needed to determine if they can be separated and on what criteria.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Refer to soil survey sample numberS68WI-107-002 for NSSL data on the typical pedon.  Refer to soil survey sample number S68WI-107-001 for NSSL data on another pedon of Waymor.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
