    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Boulogne, Kingsferry, and Lynn Haven in the same family and the Evergreen series in a similar family.  Boulogne soils are poorly drained.  Lynn Haven and Evergreen soils have a continuous E horizon between the A and Bh horizon.  In addition, Evergreen soils have a histic epipedon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wesconnett soils are in level to nearly level concave depressions and on flood plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in sandy marine deposits.  Average annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 65 to 70 degrees F.  The majority of the rainfall is during the summer and late fall."

Ridgeland soils are somewhat poorly drained.  Pottsburg and Sapelo soils are poorly drained and have an E horizon between the A and Bh horizon.  Maurepas and Pamlico soils are organic."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

Depth of the water table is less than 6 inches or the soil is ponded 4 to 12 months during most years under natural conditions.  Flooding is likely under normal conditions on the flood plains."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most of this soil is in forest.  Natural vegetation is baldcypress, pondcypress, red maple, sweetbay magnolia, sweetgum, cabbage palm, holly, and water oak, with an understory of waxmyrtle and sparse amounts of creeping bluestem, hairy bluestem, and toothachegrass."
