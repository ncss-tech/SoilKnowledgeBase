  "OVERVIEW": "The Wonsits series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from quartzite and sandstone rocks.  Wonsits soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
