  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyasket series consists of very deep, poorly drained, slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone and quartzite.  Wyasket soils are on flood plains and drainageways.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
