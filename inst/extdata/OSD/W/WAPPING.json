  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to the lithologic discontinuity range from 20 to 38 inches.  Depth to bedrock is commonly more than 6 feet.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent in the solum and from 5 to 50 percent in the substratum. Except where the surface layer is stony, the fragments are mostly subrounded pebbles and typically make up 60 percent or more of the total rock fragments.  Unless limed, the soil is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Disturbed pedons have an Ap horizon with value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Dry value is 6 or more.  The A or Ap horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam in the fine earth with more than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand.  It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable.\nThe upper part of the B horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  The lower part of the B horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 3 to 6 and high and low chroma redoximorphic features above a depth of 24 inches.  Fine earth texture of the B horizon is silt loam, very fine sandy loam or loam with more than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand.  It has weak, subangular blocky or weak granular structure or the horizon is massive. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 5Y and value and chroma of 2 to 6.  Fine earth texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loamy sand except loamy sand is below a depth of 40 inches or below a layer of sandy loam or fine sandy loam more than 5 inches thick.  The substratum typically becomes coarser-textured with increasing depth. The 2C horizon is mainly friable or very friable, but layers within the horizon range to firm."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chautauqua, Pittstown, Pompton, Rainbow, Sutton, Wilbraham, and Woodbridge series in the same family. Chautauqua soils lack a lithologic discontinuity. Pittstown, Rainbow, Wilbraham, and Woodbridge soils have a dense substratum.  Pompton soils have a stratified sandy and gravelly substratum within a depth of 40 inches. Sutton soils have less than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand in the B horizon.  Watchaug soils have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR throughout the B and C horizons.  Wilbraham soils also have low chroma redoximorphic features throughout the B horizon.\nThe Bridgehampton, Broadbrook, Brookfield, Canton, Charlton, Cheshire, Ellington, Narragansett, Ninigret, Tisbury and Scio series are similar soils in related families.  Bridgehampton and Scio soils are coarse-silty.  Broadbrook, Brookfield, Canton, Charlton, Cheshire and Narragansett soils are well drained and lack redoximorphic features.  Ellington, Ninigret and Tisbury soils have stratified sand or sand and gravel in the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wapping soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils on till plains, low ridges and upland hills, typically on lower slopes or in slightly depressed areas.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  Typically, they formed in a silty mantle over moderately coarse and coarse textured till derived from a wide variety of rocks.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches and the growing season 120 to 190 days."

Bridgehampton and Narragansett soils are well drained soils higher on the landscape than Wapping soils.  Leicester soils are poorly drained soils lower on the landscape.  Sutton soils are on similar landscape positions as Wapping and have less than 65 percent silt plus very fine sand in the B horizons."
