    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages 15 to 35 percent by volume coarser than 2 mm.  At least one subhorizon has more than 35 percent by volume coarser than 2 mm.  Typically, carbonates are at the surface, but in some pedons the depth ranges from 4 to 48 inches.  Some pedons have a very stony surface.  The amount of shale in the soil profile typically ranges from 2 to 80 percent by volume, but some pedons do not contain any shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, gravelly loamy coarse sand, coarse sandy loam, or loam.  Where the A horizon is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loam, it is 5 inches or less in thickness.  The A horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, and rarely 5Y; value of 3 to 6 (4 to 7 dry); and chroma of 1 to 4.  The C horizon is gravelly coarse sand, gravelly very coarse sand, gravelly sand, or gravelly loamy coarse sand, but has at least one layer of very gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly sand, very gravelly very coarse sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, or very gravelly loamy sand.  In some pedons it has layers of sand, coarse sand, very coarse sand, or loamy sand.  Some pedons have thin strata of finer material.  Some pedons have loam or clay loam 2C horizons of till or lacustrine sediments at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  The C horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."

The Claire soils have less than 15 percent by volume coarser than 2 mm in the 10- to 40-inch control section.  The Coe, Emmert, and Sioux soils are sandy-skeletal.  In addition, Coe and Sioux soils have mollic epipedons."
