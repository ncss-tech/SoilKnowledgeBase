  "OVERVIEW": "The Wamduska series consists of deep, excessively drained, rapidly permeable soils that formed in sorted sand and gravel.  These soils are on beaches of current and former lakes.  They are very shallow to sand and gravel.  Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 17 inches, and mean annual temperature is 41 degrees F.",

At least one subhorizon has more than 35 percent by volume coarser than 2 mm.  Typically, carbonates are at the surface, but in some pedons the depth ranges from 4 to 48 inches.  Some pedons have a very stony surface.  The amount of shale in the soil profile typically ranges from 2 to 80 percent by volume, but some pedons do not contain any shale.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, gravelly loamy coarse sand, coarse sandy loam, or loam.  Where the A horizon is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loam, it is 5 inches or less in thickness.  The A horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, and rarely 5Y; value of 3 to 6 (4 to 7 dry); and chroma of 1 to 4.  The C horizon is gravelly coarse sand, gravelly very coarse sand, gravelly sand, or gravelly loamy coarse sand, but has at least one layer of very gravelly coarse sand, very gravelly sand, very gravelly very coarse sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, or very gravelly loamy sand.  In some pedons it has layers of sand, coarse sand, very coarse sand, or loamy sand.  Some pedons have thin strata of finer material.  Some pedons have loam or clay loam 2C horizons of till or lacustrine sediments at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  The C horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline."
