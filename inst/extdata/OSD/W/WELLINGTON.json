Bigfrog, Dewar Grassval and Roseworth soils have a mean annul soil temperature of less than 11 degrees C. Chuckridge and Handpah soils are moist 10 to 20 cumulative days between July and September due to convection storms. Chuska soils are moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline in the argillic horizon. Packwood soils have loam or clay loam argillic horizons and bedrock at a depth of 20 to 60 cm.  Pipeline soils have silt loam or silty clay loam argillic horizons with less than 15 percent fine sand and coarser, and Bk horizons above the duripan. Thoms soils have an argillic horizon with clay loam, clay or loam textures."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Wellington soils were classified in the fine loamy, mixed, mesic family.  Additional mapping has revealed that these soils have duripans within 50 cm and should be in the loamy, mixed, mesic, shallow family. The revision of 01/2000 reflects this change in the concept of the series.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from 0 to 10 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 10 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nIndurated duripan - The zone from 38 to 99 cm (Bqkm1 and Bqkm2 horizons).\nParticle size control section - The zone from 10 to 38 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)."
