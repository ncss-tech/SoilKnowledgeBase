The mean annual soil temperature of depth of 20 inches ranges from 47 to 50 F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 65 to 70 F.\nDepth to bedrock ranges from 40 inches to more than 60 inches. The organic matter content decreases regularly with increasing depth and is 0.2 percent or less above the bedrock.  The 10 to 40 inch series control section averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 27 to 35 percent clay. These soils are moderately or strongly alkaline and average more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the whole soil smaller than 20 millimeter in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, chroma 3 or 4. It ranges from gravelly loam or clay loam to very gravelly loam. Rock fragments range from 15 to 65 percent gravel and cobbles. This horizon is strongly effervescent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value is 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 6 moist and chroma is 3 through 8. This horizon ranges from gravelly silty clay loam, gravelly clay loam or gravelly loam to gravelly sandy clay loam, very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly silty clay loam, loam or clay loam and has 5 to 55 percent rock fragments."
