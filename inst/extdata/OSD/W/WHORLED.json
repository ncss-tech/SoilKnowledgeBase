    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 44 to 46 degrees F.  The thickness of solum and depth to bedrock commonly is 25 to 35 inches, but ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The soil moisture control section (10 inches to the lithic contact or 10 to 30 inches) is dry from August 1 to November 1 (90 days) and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from May 1 to December 1 and exceeds 47 degrees F from June 1 to November 1.  The control section from 10 inches to the lithic contact has a weighted average of 8 to 15 percent clay and 50 to 70 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.  The 15-bar water content of the fine earth fraction ranges from 18 to 19 percent.   Base saturation by sum of cations ranges from 10 to 25 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/2 or 4/3 or 7.5YR 4/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2 or 7.5YR 3/2.  Rock fragments, mostly gravel, range from 45 to 55 percent.  Sodium fluoride pH ranges from 10.5 to 11.5.  Moist bulk density of the fine earth fraction ranges from 0.70 to 0.80 g/cc.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 5/4, 6/5; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4 or 5/6.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4; 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/4.  Sodium fluoride pH ranges from 10.0 to 11.0.  It is very or extremely gravelly sandy loam with 50 to 70 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel.
