  "OVERVIEW": "The Wormet series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils which are shallow to sandy outwash.  They formed in a thin mantle of loamy alluvium or loamy eolian deposits or both and in the underlying stratified sandy outwash on outwash terraces and outwash plains.  Permeability is moderate or moderately rapid in the loamy mantle and rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 36 inches.  Thickness of the loamy mantle ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the family control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle, but is typically less than 15 percent.  Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent as a weighted average in the sandy outwash, but ranges from 0 to 65 percent in individual strata.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the substratum.  Redox features are in the albic or spodic horizon within a depth of 20 inches.  Saturation occurs within 20 inches for some time in most years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma is 1 or 2.  Cultivated pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  The A or Ap is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  The E horizon is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam but in some pedons it is the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam, but in some pedons it is the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4. It has texture like the Bhs horizon above.\nSome pedons have a Bw horizon below the Bs horizon.  It has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 8.  It has texture like the Bhs horizon described above.  2Bw horizons with spodic colors have pH of 6.0 or more or have organic carbon content less than 0.6 percent, or both.\nSome pedons have a 2Bs horizon with color like the Bs horizon above.  It is loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, coarse sand, sand or the gravelly, very gravelly, or extremely gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a 2Bw horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 4 to 8.

The well drained Padus soils, the moderately well drained Tipler soils, and the somewhat poorly drained Worcester soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the loamy mantle is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The well drained Pence soils and the moderately well drained Manitowish soils form a drainage sequence with Wormet soils.
