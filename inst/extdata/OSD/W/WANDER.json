  "OVERVIEW": "The Wander series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from sandstone and shale. Wander soils are on mountain slopes and structural benches.  Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and mean annual temperature is about 34 degrees F.",
