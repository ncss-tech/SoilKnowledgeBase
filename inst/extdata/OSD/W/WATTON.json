The upper part of the solum ranges from extremely acid to neutral, with the lower part of the Bt horizons ranging from moderately acid to mildly alkaline.  The C horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent and volume of gravel ranges from 1 to 5 percent throughout the pedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 to 3; and chroma is 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe B/E horizon has colors and textures the same as the E and Bt horizons.  The E part in some pedons is 5YR 4/3.  The Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  They are clay loam, silty clay loam, loam, or silt loam.  A BC horizon occurs in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam or loam. Carbonate accumulations are not in the C horizon of some pedons."
