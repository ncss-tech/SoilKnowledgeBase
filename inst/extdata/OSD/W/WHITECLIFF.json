  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitecliff series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from gypsiferous and calcareous lacustrine deposits.  Whitecliff soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
