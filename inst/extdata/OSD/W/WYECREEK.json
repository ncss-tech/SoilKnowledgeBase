The andic soil material has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, a 15-bar water retention of 12 to 25 percent for air dried samples, and a 15-bar water retention of 12 to 15 percent for air dried samples with a total thickness of 10 inches or more in the subsoil.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR moist and dry, and chroma of 2 or 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.  It has 1 to 2 cmol/kg of aluminum.
