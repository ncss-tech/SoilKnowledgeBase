  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyecreek series consists of moderately deep to fractured hard bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks predominantly on glaciated mountain slopes.  Slopes are 20 to 100 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 75 inches and average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
