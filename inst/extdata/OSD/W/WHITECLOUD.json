  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitecloud series consists of very deep and somewhat excessively drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone. Whitecloud soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent. Permeability is moderate in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
