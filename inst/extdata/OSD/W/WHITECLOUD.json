The soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone. The climate is cold and moist in winter and dry in summer. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 11 inches. Mean summer air temperature is 55 to 65 degrees F, and mean annual air temperature is 38 to 43 degrees F. Frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."
