  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Wherry series is in MLRA 30.\nCharacterized by NSSL: Project 88P 174, Pedon 88P 952, Samples 88P5166-5171.\nWherry soils are somewhat poorly drained although they do not have a high water table within 6 feet of the surface.  During the winter months runoff from surrounding areas floods the soil on its depressed landform. The very low saturated hydraulic conductivity of the surface layer keeps most of the flood water from infiltrating the soil.  Most of the water is eventually lost through evaporation leaving an accumulation of salts at the surface.\nRunoff classes based on Ksat and slope as described in \"Terminology Used in Soil Survey Data Entry or Manuscript Editing of:\" 9-23-94 MAV.  Runoff changed from ponded to negligible.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this profile are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon -- 0 to 3 inches (An)\n2.  Salic horizon -- 3 to 18 inches (Bnz1 and upper Bnz2) Weighted average of depth in cm. times E.C. is 1460.\n3. Particle size class: Fine.  The 10 to 40.inch particle-size control section averages 45 percent clay based on field estimates.\n4. Soil moisture and temperature regimes\nThese values are based on adjacent soil survey areas without direct observations.  The soil temperature is below 47 degrees F. from about December 15 to February 20, and is usually never below 41 degrees F. The soil between the depths of 4 and 12 inches is dry throughout for 275 to 310 days from about March 1 to December 15.  It is moist throughout for 10 to 50 days from about January 1 to March 1 and is moist in some or all parts for 55 to 90 consecutive days from about December 15 to March 1 when the soil is above 47.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
