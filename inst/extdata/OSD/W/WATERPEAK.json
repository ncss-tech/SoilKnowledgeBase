  "STATES": "CA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Waterpeak series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Waterpeak soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 37 degrees F.",
