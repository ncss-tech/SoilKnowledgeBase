    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Waterpeak soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 8,000 to 11,000 feet.  The climate is subhumid-continental with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches, the mean annual temperature is 36 to 39 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
