  "REVDATE": "02/97",
  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodville series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils on uplands.  These nearly level to strongly sloping soils are formed in thick beds of unconsolidated clayey coastal plain sediments of Miocene Age.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  Clay content ranges from 40 to 60 percent in the upper 20 inches of the argillic horizon, and has a COLE of 0.09 or more.  Potential linear extensibility is more than 6 cm.\nThe A and E horizons are fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.  The combined A and E horizons range from 6 to 15 inches thick. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  The A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nThe E horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Mottles in shades of brown or red range from none to many. The boundary between the E and Bt horizon is abrupt or clear, and smooth or wavy, with an abrupt textural change.\nThe Bt1 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles range from few to common in shades of gray, brown, yellow, and red, and the amount of gray increases with depth.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bt2 and Bt3 horizons are typically mottled in shades of gray, red, and brown or have a matrix of these colors with common to many mottles in shades of red, yellow, and brown.  Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe lower Bt horizons and BC horizon when encountered have colors in shades of gray, red, yellow, brown, and olive.  Reaction is mainly medium acid or slightly acid, but ranges to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons contain pitted concretions of calcium carbonate."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Annona, Bryarly, and Susquehanna series in the same family and the Angie, Boswell, Millwood, Newco, Wilcox, and Woodtell series.  Annona and Bryarly soils are more alkaline in the upper Bt horizons.  Angie and Newco soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent, in addition, Newco soils have C horizons within 60 inches.  Susquehanna soils lack a water table within 6 feet and have lower reaction in the lower horizons.  In addition, Bryarly soils lack an abrupt change between the A and Bt horizons. Boswell soils lack low chroma mottles in the upper 10 inches of the Bt and have mixed mineralogy.  Millwood soils contain more than 60 percent clay in the control section and lack low chroma mottles in the upper 10 inches of the Bt horizon.  Wilcox soils lack an abrupt textural change between the A and Bt horizons and are underlain by soft shale within 60 inches.  Woodtell soils have C horizons within 60 inches, and are on Eocene age and older geological formations."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Woodville soils are on slightly convex, gently sloping to strongly sloping uplands of the West Coastal Plains.  Slopes range from 1 to 12 percent.  The soils formed in thick beds of unconsolidated clayey sediments of Miocene age, mainly of the Fleming formation.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 58 inches.  Summer rainfall ranges from 30 to 40 inches.  Summer moisture deficit ranges from 0 to 4 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 66 to 70 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E indices exceed 72."
