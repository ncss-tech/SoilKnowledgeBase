  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitecone series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale.  Whitecone soils are on footslopes of undulating plateaus and lower areas of fan terraces.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
