  "OVERVIEW": "The Winteridge series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits over slope alluvium derived from shale, sandstone, siltstone and limestone rocks.  Winteridge soils are on  summits of plateaus.  Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
