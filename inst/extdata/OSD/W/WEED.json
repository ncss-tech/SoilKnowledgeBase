The Schauson soils are  moist in some parts of the moisture control section in July, August, and September.  Center Creek soils have a noncalcareous matrix above 40 inches and mottles 20 to 40 inches below the surface.  Pachel soils have more then 15 percent rock fragments above depths of 40 inches.  Chugcreek soils have a lithic contact above 40 inches and are noncalcareous throughout.  Todacheene soils have mean summer soil temperatures below 57 degrees F."
