  "OVERVIEW": "The Waterflat series consists of very deep poorly drained soils that formed in loess and volcanic ash over old alluvium. Waterflat soils are in drainageways and swales on nonglaciated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
