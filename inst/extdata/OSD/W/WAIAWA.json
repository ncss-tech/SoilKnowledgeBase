Elevation ranges from near sea level to 610 meters (2,000 feet).  The slope is 30 to 80 percent, but predominantly 50 to 80 percent.  The soils formed in colluvium from basic igneous rocks and/or alluvium which has been deposited in pockets in the bedrock.  Rock outcrops cover about 20 to 50 percent of the area.  Average annual rainfall ranges from 508 to 1,016 millimeters (20 to 40 inches), most of which falls in the winter.  Average January air temperature is about 22 degrees C. (71 degrees F.); average July air temperature is about 26 degrees C. (78 degrees F.)  Mean annual air temperature is about 24 degrees C. (75 degrees F.)"
