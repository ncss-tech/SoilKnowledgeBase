  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Au Gres, Battlefield, Kinross, and Wormet series. Au Gres soils average less than 50 percent fine sand in the particle-size control section (are dominantly medium sand). Battlefield soils have more than 5 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Kinross soils are saturated for a period of 90 to 120 days when the soil temperature is above 5 degrees C. Wormet soils do not have fine sand or loamy fine sand textures in the upper part of the series control section."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 864 mm (28 to 34 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 5.0 to 7.8 degrees C (41 to 46 degrees F)."
