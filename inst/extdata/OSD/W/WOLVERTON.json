  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 16 inches thick.  The depth to fine-loamy till ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The calcic horizon occurs within 16 inches of the surface and has less than 25 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  The soil is slightly alkaline to moderately alkaline. Rock fragments are typically lacking in the upper mantle and range from 1 to 10 percent, by volume, in the lower material.  The soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in most years.\nThe Ap and Ak horizons have 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  They are very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, loamy very fine sand or loamy fine sand.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is loamy very fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  In some pedons the lower part is very fine sand, fine sand or sand.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bkg horizon and/or a 2Bk horizon.\nThe 2C and 2BCky horizons have hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  They are clay loam, silty clay loam or loam.  The average clay content of the glacial till ranges from 18 to 35 percent. The horizons are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons do not have a 2BCky horizon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils have plane or slightly convex slopes with gradient of 0 to 3 percent on glacial lake plains and ground moraines.  They are formed in 20 to 40 inches of calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments over fine-loamy calcareous glacial till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 24 inches. Frost free days range from 110 to 140.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 785 to 1000 feet."
