  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick, and includes part of the argillic horizon in most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reddish or brownish mottles range from none to a few.  It is loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam.  The reaction ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe Btl horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Mottles in shades of brown ranges from few to common.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay and more than 20 percent silt in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon.  The reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe lower Bt horizon is mottled mainly in shades of brown dominant hue of 10YR or 2.5Y with or without fine or medium reddish mottles.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and the reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.  Some pedons are moderately alkaline below a depth of 50 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other competing series in this family.  Similar competing series are Bonham, Brewer, Garton, Muldrow, and Parisian.  These soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  In addition, Brewer soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods of time and Parisian soils have vertic properties."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Waskom soils are on nearly level stream terraces mainly along the Red River.  Typically they are on the first terrace level.  Slopes are less than 1 percent.  The soils formed in alkaline alluvial sediments.  The mean annual precipitation at the type location is about 45 inches; the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite annual P-E index is about 78."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Gallion and Muldrow series.  Gallion soils lack mollic epipedons and have higher chromas in the argillic horizon.  Gallion soils are on slightly higher positions and Muldrow soils are below on slightly lower positions."
