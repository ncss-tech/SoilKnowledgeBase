Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  Elevations are 5,000 to 5,800 feet.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  The mountain valleys are subject to cold air drainage and frost pockets.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 35 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 10 to 30 days."
