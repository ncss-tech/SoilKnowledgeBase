  "OVERVIEW": "The Walkermine series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks.  Walkermine soils are on ridge tops and side slopes on metamorphic Sierra Nevada mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 110 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 72 inches, (1829 mm) and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F, (10 degrees C).",
