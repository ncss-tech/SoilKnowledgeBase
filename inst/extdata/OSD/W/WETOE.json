  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetoe series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and slope alluvium derived from diorite and similar igneous rocks.  Wetoe soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 35 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
