    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Westland soils are in depressions and on flats on outwash plains, stream terraces, and glacial drainage channels. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Westland soils formed in loamy material that can be capped with up to 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material. They are deep to calcareous, stratified gravelly and sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1092 mm (36 to 43 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 9.4 to 12.8 degrees C (49 to 55 degrees F)."

In drained areas, depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface during winter and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material."

Also, an undrained phase is recognized.\nRepresentative data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 153135 in MO 11.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Supporting characterization data is available from the Purdue University Soil Characterization Laboratory for pedon S80IN177-11. Transect data is on file at the MLRA Project Office in Indianapolis.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
