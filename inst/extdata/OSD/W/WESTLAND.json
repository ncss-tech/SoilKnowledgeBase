  "OVERVIEW": "The Westland series consists of very deep, poorly drained and very poorly drained soils that are deep to calcareous, stratified gravelly and sandy outwash. Westland soils formed in loamy material that can be capped with as much as 51 cm (20 inches) of loess or silty material. They are in depressions and on flats on outwash plains, stream terraces, and glacial drainage channels. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

In drained areas, depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) below the surface during winter and spring in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible or very low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material."

Also, an undrained phase is recognized.\nRepresentative data mapunit for this pedon is DMU ID 153135 in MO 11.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Supporting characterization data is available from the Purdue University Soil Characterization Laboratory for pedon S80IN177-11. Transect data is on file at the MLRA Project Office in Indianapolis.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
