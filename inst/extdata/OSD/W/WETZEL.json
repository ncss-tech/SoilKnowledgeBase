The soils formed in clayey till and in places in an overlying deposit up to 46 cm (18 inches) thick of clayey lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 838 to 965 mm (33 to 38 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 9 to 12 degrees C (49 to 53 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Blount and Nappanee soils and the moderately well drained Glynwood, Morley, and St. Clair soils are on higher topographic positions or on steeper slopes. In addition, the Nappanee and St. Clair soils contain more clay. The very poorly drained Hoytville and Pewamo soils have a darker colored surface layer and are on similar topographic positions."
