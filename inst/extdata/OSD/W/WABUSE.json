  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wabuse series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in sandy eolian, glaciolacustrine or outwash material overlying loamy glaciolacustrine sediments. They are on glacial lake plains.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderate. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches.",
