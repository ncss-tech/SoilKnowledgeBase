Depth to carbonates is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to loamy sediments is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or loamy sand.  Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR , 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, fine sand, sand or coarse sand.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or very fine sandy loam. Thin subhorizons or strata of fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand or loam commonly occur.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wabuse soils are on concave to linear surfaces of glacial lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in outwash, eolian or glaciolacustrine sand and the underlying glaciolacustrine loamy sediments. Mean annual air temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 28 inches.  The frost-free period is 95 to 125 days.  Elevation above sea level is 1250 to 1400 feet."

Moderately well drained Keenan, somewhat poorly drained Vasso and very poorly drained Kapla soils  form a hydrosequence with the Wabuse soils. Somewhat poorly drained Barber, and moderately well drained Westoo soils do not have loamy material in the lower part of the series control section."
