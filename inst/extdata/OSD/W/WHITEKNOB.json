  "OVERVIEW": "The Whiteknob series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium. These soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

The soils are usually dry, but are moist between depths of 12 and 35 inches for about 70 to 85 consecutive days in the spring. The depth to the calcic horizon is 10 to 15 inches. Depth to contrasting sand and gravel (2Bk horizon) is 10 to 25 inches. The particle-size control section has 35 to 90 percent coarse fragments with the upper 10 inches having 45 to 70 percent sand and 5 to 10 percent clay and the lower 20 inches having 80 to 95 percent sand and 3 to 8 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has granular or platy structure and has 0 to 50 percent gravel. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent is 10 to 20 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It has weak and moderate subangular blocky structure. Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline. It is loam or gravelly loam with 10 to 18 percent clay and 0 to 35 percent gravel. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 10 to 20 percent.\nThe 2Bk1 or 2Bkq1 horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 30 percent. It is very gravelly or extremely gravelly sandy loam or loam with 5 to 10 percent clay and 35 to 90 percent cobbles and gravel.\nThe 2Bk2 or 2Bkq2 horizon is very gravelly or extremely gravelly sand or loamy coarse sand with 3 to 8 percent clay and 50 to 90 percent cobbles and gravel. Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 35 percent."
