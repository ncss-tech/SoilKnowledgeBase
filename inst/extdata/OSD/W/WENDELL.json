  "OVERVIEW": "The Wendell series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits.  Wendell soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 1 to 12 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
