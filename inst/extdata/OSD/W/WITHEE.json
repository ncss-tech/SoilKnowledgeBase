  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the silty mantle and depth to till range from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is more than 40 inches. Free carbonates are absent to a depth of 80 inches or more. The content of clay averages 18 to 25 percent in the particle size control section and the content of fine sand or coarser averages 15 to 65 percent. Volume of rock fragments averages less than 15 percent in the silty mantle and less than 35 percent in the till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle and from 3 to 35 percent in the till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 10 percent in the till. Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout the soil, but ranges to neutral in the upper part, where the soil is limed. Redox concentrations are typically throughout the pedon below the Ap or A horizon. Redox depletions, with chroma of 2 or less, are in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon and aquic conditions occur there at some time in most years.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3. Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more. The E horizon is silt loam or silt.\nWithee soils have a glossic horizon. Horizonation has a wide range depending on the thickness of the silty mantle and the degree to which eluviation has occurred. Therefore these can be E/B, B/E, 2E/B, or 2B/E horizons singly or in combination, with or without a Bt horizon.\nThe E part of the E/B or B/E horizon has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with color and texture like the Bt part described above. Some pedons have a Btg horizon, with dominant chroma of 2, below the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.\nThe 2E part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3. It is loam, sandy clay loam, or the gravelly analogs. Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.\nThe 2Bt part of the 2E/B or 2B/E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. Value and chroma of 3 do not occur together. It is loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe 2Bt horizon has color like the 2Bt part described above. It is typically loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam or the gravelly analogs at least in the upper part, but grades to sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam in the lower part in some pedons. Bulk density ranges from 1.6 to 1.85 g/cm3.\nSome pedons have a 2BC horizon with colors and textures like the 2C horizon described below.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, clay loam, or the gravelly analogs. Bulk density ranges from 1.7 to 1.95 g/cm3."
