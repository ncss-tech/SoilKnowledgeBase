  "OVERVIEW": "The Wagontire series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  Wagontire soils are on fan remnants and alluvial terraces.  Slopes are 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
