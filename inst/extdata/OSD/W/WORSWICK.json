These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources. Elevation is 0 to 50 meters (0 to 160 feet). The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 2030 millimeters (35 to 80 inches). The mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C. The mean annual air temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). The frost free season is about 275 to 330 days."

    "content": "REMARKS: Worswick soils were proposed in 1994 as coarse-loamy, mixed, nonacid, mesic Aeric Fluvaquents.  Reclassification to coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, nonacid, isomesic Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts is based on temperature data recorded in the survey area 2001 through 2004.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 23 centimeters (Ap).\n2.  Cambic horizon - 23 to 152 centimeters (Bg1 and Bg2)\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters averages 12 percent clay by weight and 19 percent fine sand or coarser, by volume (Bg1, Bg2).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon number S02CA-023-017 analyzed by the National Soil Survey Laboratory.\nNasis User Pedon ID: 88CA600039\nSoil classified using Keys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
