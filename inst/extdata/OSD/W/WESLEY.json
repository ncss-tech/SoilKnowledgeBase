    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development typically is 84 to 135 cm (33 to 53 inches) and ranges from 61 to 135 cm (24 to 53 inches). Depth to horizons averaging more than 20 percent clay and less than 50 percent sand range from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Thickness of the mollic epipedon is typically from 25 to 50 cm (10 to 20 inches). Reaction in the upper sandy or loamy material ranges from moderately acid to neutral and the lower material is neutral to moderately alkaline. Carbonates typically are in the lower part of the subsoil and in the substratum.\nThe upper part of the series control section (A or AB horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nSome pedons have a BA horizon rather than an AB horizon.\nThe middle part of the series control section (Bt or Bw horizon) has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 6. It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or very fine sand. Some pedons contain thin strata of sandy clay loam or clay loam.\nThe lower part of the series control section (2Bt, 2BC, or 2C horizon) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 4 through 6; and chroma of 0 through 4. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or loam. Some pedons contain as much as 5 percent gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wesley soils commonly are on low ridges in former glacial lakes or occur as relatively small spots or streaks on till plains. Slope gradients commonly are 0 to 3 percent and range from 0 to 5 percent. The soils formed in loamy or sandy outwash material about 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) thick over moderately fine textured lacustrine material or till of Wisconsinan Age. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 8 to 12 degrees C (47 to 54 degrees F.), the mean annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 1065 mm (29 to 42 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 180 to 311 meters (590 to 1,020 feet) above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Wesley soils are near the competing Hoopeston soils and the Milford, Oakville, and Watseka soils on nearby landscapes and near Elliot and Varna soils on till plains. The poorly drained Milford soils contain more clay throughout and are in low lying positions. The sandy Oakville soils are well drained and are on higher ridges. The sandy Watseka soils are in similar positions. Elliot and Varna soils formed in silty clay loam till."

An intermittent perched seasonal high water table is at a depth of 30 to 61 cm (1 to 2 feet) below the surface at some time during the spring in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high (14.11 to 141.11 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the profile and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the lower part. Permeability is moderately rapid or rapid in the upper part of the profile and moderately slow in the lower part."
