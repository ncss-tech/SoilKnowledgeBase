  "OVERVIEW": "The Wesley series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in coarse textured outwash material and in the underlying moderately fine textured lakebed sediments or till. They are on low ridges in former glacial lakes and on till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 970 mm (38 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high (14.11 to 141.11 micrometers per second) in the upper part of the profile and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers per second) in the lower part.
