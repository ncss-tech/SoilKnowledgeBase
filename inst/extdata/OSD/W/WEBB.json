  "OVERVIEW": "The Webb series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy residuum from noncemented sandstone bedrock.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils occur on footslopes of broad, low ridges.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 610 mm (24 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F).",

Crops grown are peanuts, melons, grain sorghum, cotton, corn, wheat, vegetables, and tame pasture.  Under climax conditions, the dominant native grasses are twoflower and fourflower trichloris, tanglehead, plains bristlegrass, pink pappusgrass, buffalograss, and Arizona cottontop.  About 5 percent perennial forbs and 5 percent shrubs also occur.  With retrogression, typical increasers and invaders are mesquite, spiny hackberry, blackbrush, pricklypear, hooded windmillgrass, threeawn, Hall's panicum, red lovegrass, fringed signalgrass, grassbur, and annual forbs."
