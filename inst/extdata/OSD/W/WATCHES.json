  "OVERVIEW": "The Watches series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist or phyllite rock types.  Watches soils occur on broad ridgetops and side slopes of coastal hills and mountains.  Slopes are 0 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
