  "OVERVIEW": "The Whirlo series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks with a component of loess.  Whirlo soils are on inset fans, fan aprons, fan collars and fan skirts.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
