  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  Volume of pebbles ranges from 0 to 20 percent in the solum and 10 to 20 percent in the substratum.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout the pedon. The A horizon is neutral to medium acid.  The B horizon is strongly acid to slightly acid.  The C horizon is medium acid to slightly acid.\nThe Ap or A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Lower value and chroma is typical for the A horizon.  Where the Ap horizon has low value and chroma moist, the color value dry is 6 or more.  It is typically loam and atypically silt loam or gravelly loam.\nThe E horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or loam.  The BE horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR or 7.5YR hue, value and chroma of 4 or 5.  It is loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, or the gravelly analogues.\nThe BC horizon has 7.5YR or 5YR hue, value and chroma of 4 or 5.  It is loam, sandy loam, or the gravelly analogues.\nThe C horizon has 7.5YR or 5YR hue, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.  It typically is stratified with gravelly loam and gravelly sandy loam, but in some pedons, there are thin strata of coarser textures."

Amanda, Chenault, Chili, Coggan, Douds, El Dara, Gallman, Grellton, Hickory, Kalamazoo, Kanawha, Martinville, Mifflin, Nodine, Ockley, Pecatonica, Princeton, Renova, Richland, Riddles, Roseville, Westville, and Woodbine soils have sola thicker than 40 inches.  Belmont, Conestoga, and Hollinger soils receive more rainfall.  Belmore and Lindley soils do not have 5YR hue in the lower part of the solum above a depth of 40 inches.  Hayden, Letort, Rawson, Relay, and Wauwasee soils have yellower hue within the lower part of the series control section.  Hebron, Kendallville, Kidder, Kosciusko, LeRoy, McHenry, Miami, Sisson, Strawn, and Theresa soils have free carbonates within a depth of 40 inches.  Mandeville soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Owosso soils have more sand in the particle-size control section.  Rockbridge soils contain more coarse fragments in the lower part of the series control section, Summitville soils have redder hue in the upper part of the argillic horizon and range to a thinner solum although there is some overlap."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wykoff soils are on ground moraines.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  They formed in 20 to 40 inches of loamy and silty deposits and the underlying gravelly sandy loam and loam drift.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 56 degrees F."

The well drained Renova and moderately well drained Vlasaty soils are on similar topography.  The Wykoff soils occur where the till contains less clay and shows more evidence of sorting by water."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Until 1972, Minnesota had responsibility for the Wykoff series.  In 1972, the responsibility of the series was relinquished to Wisconsin.  The series has not been used in Wisconsin since it was last correlated in Pierce County in 1965.  The particle-size class has been changed from fine-loamy over sandy or sandyskeletal to fine-loamy based upon the typical pedon described in the Pierce County, Wisconsin Soil Survey Report.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  ochric epipedon - zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 8 inches (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - zone from 12 to 23 inches (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
