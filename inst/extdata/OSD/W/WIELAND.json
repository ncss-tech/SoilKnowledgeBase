  "OVERVIEW": "The Wieland series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Wieland soils are on fan remnants, ballenas, and plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
