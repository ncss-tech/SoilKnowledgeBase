    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wieland soils are on fan remnants, ballenas, and plateaus.  They typically occur on summit, shoulder, and upper backslope positions.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 2,170 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
