  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wrays soils are on moderately sloping and strongly sloping shoulders and backslopes of hills and knobs. Slopes range from 6 to 25 percent. They formed in 56 to 91 cm or 22 to 36 inches of loess and the underlying residuum from siltstone. The bedrock is from the upper part of the Spickert Knob Formation, Borden Group, in Indiana (See Remarks). The mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 to 57 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches). Frost free days range from 170 to 200. Elevation ranges from 105.2 to 305 meters (345 to 1000 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Brownstown, Gilwood, Gnawbone, Spickert and Wellrock soils. The moderately deep, well drained Brownstown soils are on backslopes. The moderately deep, well drained Gilwood soils are typically on shoulders and the upper part of backslopes. The moderately well drained Spickert soils have a fragipan and typically are on summits and shoulders. The moderately deep, well drained Gnawbone soils and the well drained, less channery Wellrock soils typically are on similar landform positions as the Wrays soils, but at lower elevations."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/s) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately slow in the lower part. The potential for surface water runoff is medium."
