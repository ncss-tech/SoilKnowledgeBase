In open areas tall and mid grasses such as bluestems, tridens and panicums are common with longleaf uniola under the tree canopy.  American beautyberry and hawthorn species are also a part of the understory.  The main pasture plants are bermudagrass and bahiagrasse with crimson and arrowleaf clovers.  There are scattered shortleaf and loblolly pine with small plantations and some dense pine areas on the eastern side of the series province.  Some areas are planted to small grain for winter grazing."
