  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Wessel soils have 0 to 25 percent rock fragments in the B2 horizon and 35 to 50 percent just beneath the B horizon.  Depth to fractured limestone bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.  Mean annual soil temperature is 37 to 43 degrees F. and average summer soil temperature at lithic contact is 44 to 47 degrees F. under an 0 horizon and full forest canopy.  Under the forest mat some pedons have A1 horizons as much as two inches thick, other pedons have A2 horizons as much as two inches thick.  The ash-rich mantle (B2 horizon) has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 through 5.  It contains from 50 to 80 percent silt plus very fine sand and less than 5 percent rock fragments.  This horizon is medium acid to mildly alkaline.  In pedons where fractured bedrock occurs as shallow as 20 inches, accumulated lime is on rock fragments and in soil filling crevices.  Rocks in the upper part of the R layer in these pedons are stained with reddish brown and some have patches of organically stained clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Coerock, Craddock, and Holloway series and the tentative Tropal series.  Coerock and Tropal soils have bedrock at depths shallower than 20 inches.  In addition, Coerock soils have an ash-rich mantle thicker than 14 inches and Tropal soils lack the ash-rich mantle B horizons.  Craddock and Holloway soils have bedrock at depths greater than 40 inches and they lack free calcium carbonate."

The climate is cool subhumid with deep winter snow cover.  Mean annual precipitation is estimated as 25 to 50 inches.  Mean annual temperature is estimated at 34 to 40 degrees F.  Average summer temperature is 50 to 60 degrees F."
