    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wrenza soils are on upper mountains flanks. They typically occur on upper backslope positions. These soils formed in colluvium derived from metamorphic parent material. Slopes are 30 to 75 percent. Elevations range from 2,400 to 3,000 meters. The climate is subhumid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 610 to 710 mm derived mostly from snow with additional moisture as run-on from steep upper slopes. The mean annual temperature is 4 to 6 degrees C and the frost-free period is 50 to 80 days. Frost may occur in any month at the higher elevations."

Inpendence soils are very deep, average greater than 3 percent organic matter throughout A horizons, and have reactions that average very strongly acid through moderately acid in the umbric epipedon. Hackwood soils are very deep, have clay content averaging greater than 18 percent and rock fragments averaging less than 35 percent in the particle size control section. Hapgood soils are deep and average greater than 18 percent clay in the particle size control section. Hackwood and Hapgood soils have a base saturation that averages greater than 50 percent in some or all parts."
