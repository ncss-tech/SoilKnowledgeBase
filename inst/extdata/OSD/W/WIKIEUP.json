  "OVERVIEW": "The Wikieup series consists of very shallow and shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed igneous and metamorphic alluvium and colluvium.  Wikieup soils are on pediments, hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 3 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
