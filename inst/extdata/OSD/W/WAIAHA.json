  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Waiaha soils are on low elevation, leeward slopes of Mauna Loa and Hualalai volcanoes at elevations from sea level to 305 meters (0 to 1000 feet).  These soils are on all hillslope components of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating or rolling to very steep `a`a or pahoehoe lava flows that are 5,000 to 10,000 years old.  The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over `a`a or pahoehoe lava.  The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from April through October.  The mean annual pan evaporation 1020 to 1520 millimeters (40 to 60 inches).  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 22 to 24 degrees C (72 to 76 degrees F).  The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."

Old classification: Medial-skeletal, isohyperthermic Lithic Eutrandepts.  Series concept now allows shallow soil over `a`a bedrock.  Type location was moved to a representative site.
