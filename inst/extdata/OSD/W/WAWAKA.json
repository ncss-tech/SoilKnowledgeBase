The original Wawaka series concept fits the Miami, gravelly substratum phase as correlated in several subsets of soil surveys.\nRepresentative data mapunits are as follows: DMU ID 123784 for the nearly level phase; DMU ID 123785 for the gently sloping phase; and DMU ID 123786 for the moderately sloping phase.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for this pedon, S92IN-035-006, is from the National Soil Survey Lab, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
