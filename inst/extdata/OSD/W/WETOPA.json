Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent in the A and Bt horizons, and from 0 to 35 percent below the Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures are clay loam, or clay with clay ranging from 35 to 55 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe BC or C horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The lower subhorizons and substratum are clay.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid or slightly acid."
