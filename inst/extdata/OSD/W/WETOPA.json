  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetopa series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from interbedded sandstone and shale with surface basalt in some areas. Wetopa soils are on valley side slopes.  Slopes range from 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Textures are clay loam, or clay with clay ranging from 35 to 55 percent.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe BC or C horizon, if present, has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The lower subhorizons and substratum are clay.  Reaction ranges from moderately acid or slightly acid."
