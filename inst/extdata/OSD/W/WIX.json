Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Base saturation ranges from 60 to 100 percent.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in the A and Bt horizons and from 15 to 35 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 6 through 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6.  It is typically sandy clay loam, but the fine earth fraction has 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 35 percent silt, 40 to 75 percent sand, with more than 35 percent being fine or coarser sand.  This horizon is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR.  It ranges from gravelly sandy loam to gravelly clay loam."

Beardall soils have a mixed E and B horizon, a k horizon, and have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Rimton soils have a mixed E and B horizon.  Ula soils have hue of 5YR or redder in the Bt horizon.  Amesmont soils have hues in the Bt of 7.5YR and redder, and have mean summer soil temperatures colder than 47 degrees F.  Swapps soils have a lithic contact above 40 inches."
