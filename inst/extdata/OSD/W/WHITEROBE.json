  "OVERVIEW": "The Whiterobe series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from granitoid and/or gneissic rock. Whiterobe soils are on mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 75 percent. The average annual precipitation is 100 millimeters (4 inches) and the average annual air temperature is 21.5 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
