    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum is 40 to 60 inches and depth of the soil is greater than 60 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 to 20 inches is dry in all parts from June 15 to October 15, and is moist in all parts from January 1 to April 15.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 55 percent clay content.  Base saturation (sum of cations) is 60 to 90 percent throughout, and is 75 percent or more in at least some part of the argillic horizon.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral throughout the A horizon and B horizon and neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4; 10YR 6/4, or 7/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 10YR 3/4, or 4/3.  Moist value of 3 occurs throughout the upper 4 to 6 inches.\nThe Bt horizon is 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4, 6/6; or 10YR 6/4.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 4/4, 5/4, 5/6; or 10YR 6/3.  It is clay loam or clay with 35 to 55 percent clay.  It contains 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Some pedons lack an BC horizon.\nThe C horizon is 7.5YR 6/4, 6/6; or 10YR 6/4.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6; 10YR 6/3 or 5/3.  It is clay loam or clay with 0 to 15 percent gravel."
