The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 54 degrees F.  The solum is over 60 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 20 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 20 percent gravel, and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is strongly to slightly acid throughout.\nThe A and BA horizon have hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  The A horizon has 2 to 6 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR, value of 4 through 6 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 4 through 8 moist and dry.  It has 5 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It is a loam, clay loam or gravelly clay loam.  Hue of 10YR occurs only in the upper part."
