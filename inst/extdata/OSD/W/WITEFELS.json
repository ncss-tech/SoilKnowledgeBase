  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Witefels soils are on mountain slopes at elevations of 2100 to 2896 meters.  They formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rocks.  Slopes are 4 to 75 percent.  Rock outcrops are common.  The climate is semiarid with cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 890 to 1270 mm most of which is snow.  The mean annual temperature is 1 to 5 degrees C., and the frost-free season is less than 80 days."
