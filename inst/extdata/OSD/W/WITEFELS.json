  "OVERVIEW": "The Witefels series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from granitic rock.  Witefels soils are on mountains and have slopes ranging from 4 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 1015 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
