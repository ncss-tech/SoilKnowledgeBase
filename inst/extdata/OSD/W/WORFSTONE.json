  "OVERVIEW": "The Worfstone series consists of well drained soils that are shallow to hard conglomerate on uplands.  These soils are on ridges and hillsides.  They formed in residuum.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to hard conglomerate bedrock and lithic contact ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean annual summer soil temperature is 59 to 63 degrees F.  Organic matter averages 1 to 2 percent in the upper part of the soil.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4.  This horizon is sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam in the upper part and very gravelly sandy clay loam or extremely gravelly sandy clay loam in the lower part.  The matrix is 20 to 30 percent clay.  When mixed, however, coarse fragments range from 35 to about 60 percent throughout.  It is mildly alkaline or less commonly moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is extremely sandy loam with 10 to 20 percent clay and 65 to 80 percent pebbles.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 15 to 30 percent.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  EC is less than 2 mmhos.\nThe bedrock consists of hard conglomerate bedrock many feet thick.  The rock fragments are dominantly pebbles with a few scattered cobble in the matrix."
