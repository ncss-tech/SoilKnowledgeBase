  "OVERVIEW": "The Weikert series consist of shallow, well drained soils formed in material that weathered from interbedded gray and brown acid shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone on gently sloping to very steep areas on uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 100 percent. Permeability is moderately rapid.  Mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 8 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Rock fragments  range from 5 to 50 percent in the A or Ap horizon, from 35 to 60 percent in the Bw horizon, and from  60 to 85 percent in the C horizon. The sand fraction and rock fragments have a low content of feldspars, hydrobiotite, and chlorite. Unlimed reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid in the A or Ap horizon and moderately acid to extremely acid in the Bw and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam, or channery or very channery silt loam. Undisturbed pedons have a thin dark A horizon underlain by a 2 to 5 inch thick yellowish brown E horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is very channery silt loam or very channery loam.  The fine-earth fraction has about 10 to 25 percent clay, 40 to 60 percent silt, and 20 to 40 percent sand.  Structure of the Bw is weak or moderate, fine or medium subangular blocky. Moist consistence is friable or very friable, nonsticky or slightly sticky, and nonplastic or slightly plastic.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  Texture is extremely channery silt loam or extremely channery loam with common interstitial pores.  The fine-earth fraction is much like the horizon above but has massive or platy bedrock controlled structure.\nSome pedons have a Cr horizon beginning at depths of less than 20 inches. Fractures are less than 4 inches apart but displacement of the pieces is rare. Some of the fragments are coated with silt films.\nThe R consists of shale, siltstone, fine-grained sandstone, or alternate beds of such material.  The bedrock is sometimes fractured."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Arnot, Klinesville, Nassau, and Sylvatus series in the same family. Arnot and Nassau soils are formed in a thin mantle of glacial till or congeliturbate.  Arnot and Nassau soils appear similar in the field but analytical data show 10 to 40 percent of the clay fraction of Weikert is kaolinite, whereas this mineral is lacking in the Arnot and Nassau soils. Sylvatus soils contain fragments of metasediments, primarily phyllite and slate. Klinesville soils have inherited hues redder than 7.5YR.\nBugley, Rohan, and Unicoi are a related family. They are all semiactive. In addition, Bugley soils have rock fragments of schist in the solum. Rohan soils have carbonaceous bedrock. Unicoi soils have a much higher content of feldspar, hydrobiotite, and chlorite in the sand fraction."
