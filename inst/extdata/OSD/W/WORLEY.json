  "OVERVIEW": "The Worley series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loess.  Worley soils are on narrow ridge tops of dissected plains and hills and have slopes of 5 to 35 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F..",

There is a perched water table above the Bt horizon in the spring.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter throughout.  Base saturation is 30 to 50 percent.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Base saturation is 40 to 50 percent\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist.
