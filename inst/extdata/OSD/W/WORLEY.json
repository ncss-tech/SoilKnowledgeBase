The umbric epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to the Btk and secondary carbonates is 35 to 45 inches.  Depth to the argillic (Bt) horizon is 15 to 22 inches.  There is a perched water table above the Bt horizon in the spring.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay.  It has 2 to 4 percent organic matter throughout.  Base saturation is 30 to 50 percent.\nThe E horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Base saturation is 40 to 50 percent\nThe Bt and Btk horizons have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry and 4 or 5 moist.  The upper part (Bt) is silty clay with 40 to 50 percent clay and is moderately alkaline with a base saturation of 50 to 70 percent.  The lower part (Btk) is silty clay loam in with 30 to 40 percent clay and is neutral with base saturation of 70 to 90 percent."
