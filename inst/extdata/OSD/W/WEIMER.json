  "OVERVIEW": "The Weimer series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived from volcanic rocks. Weimer soils are on flats of internally drained basins and lake plains. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 330 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
