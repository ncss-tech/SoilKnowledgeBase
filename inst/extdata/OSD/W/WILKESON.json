The soils formed primarily in weathered andesite and basalt. The climate is marine with an average annual precipitation of 50 to 70 inches, occurring mostly as snowfall and heavy rainfall during the winter periods, with cool dry summers.  Average January temperature is 30 degrees F, average July temperature 63 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is l25 to l75 days.
