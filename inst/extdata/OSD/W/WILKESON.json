The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 49 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following summer solstice.  The particle- size control section averages l8 to 35 percent clay and l5 to 35 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of l0YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. It is loam, gravelly silt loam, loam, gravelly clay loam, or gravelly silty clay loam.  It has moderate prismatic or subangular blocky structure.\nThe BCt horizon has hue of l0YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 moist, 5 through 8 dry, and chroma of 3 through 6 dry. It has weak subangular blocky structure or is massive.  In some pedons the lower portion of the BCt horizon contains strongly weathered andesite or basalt stones.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wilkeson soils are on convex slopes in the foothills of the Cascade Mountains. Elevations range from 600 to l,800 feet.  The soils formed primarily in weathered andesite and basalt. The climate is marine with an average annual precipitation of 50 to 70 inches, occurring mostly as snowfall and heavy rainfall during the winter periods, with cool dry summers.  Average January temperature is 30 degrees F, average July temperature 63 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 47 degrees F.  The frost-free season is l25 to l75 days.  The growing season (28 degrees F) is 150 to 200 days."
