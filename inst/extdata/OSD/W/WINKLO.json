  "OVERVIEW": "The Winklo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks.  The Winklo soils are on mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
