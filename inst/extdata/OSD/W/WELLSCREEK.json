    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wellscreek soils are on fans, toeslopes, footslopes and backslopes of mountains.  These soils formed in colluvium from sedimentary and metasedimentary rock, with a small component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  Elevations range from 2,000 to 3,200 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 18 to 25 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 23 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 46 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."
