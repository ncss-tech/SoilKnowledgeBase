  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum ranges from 20 to 60 inches thick. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the A, Ap, AB, or E horizon, and 0 to 15 percent in the B horizon. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed. Flakes of mica are common or many in the surface layer and upper B horizon and many in the lower B and C horizons.\nThe A or Ap horizon, or AB horizon where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. Where value is 3 or less, this horizon is less than 7 inches thick. Texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have E horizons that have slightly higher values and chroma than the A or Ap horizon. Texture is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or coarse sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles, if they occur, are in shades of red, yellow, or brown. Texture is sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles, if they occur, are in shades of red, yellow, or brown. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles, if they occur, are in shades of red, yellow, or brown. The texture of the fine earth is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, and coarse sandy loam.\nThe C horizon is multicolored or has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 8, and chroma of 1 to 8. It is saprolite weathered from high-metamorphic rocks high in mica content such as mica schist and mica gneiss Texture is loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Brownwood, Cashiers, Chandler, Fannin, Lauada, and Micaville series.  Fannin and Lauada soils have Bt horizons of 5YR or redder hues. Brownwood, Cashiers, Chandler, and Micaville soils do not have argillic horizons. Brownwood and Lauada soils are moderately deep and Micaville soils are deep to a paralithic contact, respectively."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Watauga soils are on gently sloping to very steep ridges and side slopes in the Southern Appalachian Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 50  percent. Elevation ranges from 1,400 to 4,000 feet. They formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and is weathered from high-grade metamorphic rocks that are high in mica content such as mica gneiss and mica schist. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 57 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from about 45 to 60 inches."

Brevard, Saunook, Tate, Thunder, and Tusquitee formed in colluvium, have less mica, and are in coves. Brownwood, Cashiers, Chandler, Chestnut, Clifton, Cowee, Edneyville, Evard, Fannin, Lauada, and Micaville soils are on ridges and side slopes. In addition, the moderately deep Chestnut and the very deep Edneyville soils contain less mica and have a cambic horizon. The moderately deep Cowee and very deep Evard soils contain less mica. Clifton and Hayesville soils are in a fine particle-size class."
