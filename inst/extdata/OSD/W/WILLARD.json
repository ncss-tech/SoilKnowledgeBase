  "OVERVIEW": "The Willard series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in stratified, moderately fine textured lacustrine deposits from mixed alluvium. These soils are typically on level to nearly level lake terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation about 11 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
