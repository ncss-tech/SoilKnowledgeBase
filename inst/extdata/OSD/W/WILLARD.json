Threadgill soils are in the active cation exchange activity class, and are formed in calcareous alluvium derived from limestone. They also do not have gypsum and relic redoximorphic features in the lower part."

The soils formed in stratified, moderately fine textured lacustrine deposits from mixed alluvium. Slope ranges 0 to 1 percent. Average annual precipitation ranges from 11 to 13 inches with most being received during the summer months. Average annual temperature ranges from 52 to 54 degrees F. Frost free season ranges from 120 to 140 days. Elevation ranges from 5,400 to 7000 feet."
