  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 89 to 190 cm (35 to 75 in). Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 cm (60 in). The depth to the fragipan ranges from 43 to 66 cm (17 to 26 in). Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 40 percent by volume in the A and Bw horizons and from 15 to 50 percent in the Bx and C horizons. Unless limed, reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum and strongly acid to moderately acid in the C horizon. Redoximorphic features occur below 30 cm (12 in).\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3. Dry color value is 6 or more. It is silt loam to fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak to strong granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. O or E horizons are present in some pedons. Where present, the Ap can range up to 30 cm (12 in) thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, granular, blocky, or prismatic.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. Prism face colors range from weak red (2.5YR 5/2) to pale brown (10YR 6/3). Structure is prismatic with ped interiors parting to platy or blocky structure or they are massive. Consistence is firm to extremely firm, although a subhorizon of the Bx may be firm. Gray or brown redoximorphic features may be present.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C or Cd horizon, where present, has color and texture similar to the Bx horizon, but lacks very coarse prismatic structure and is relatively more friable."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Willowemoc soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils on glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The soils developed in firm, acid till high in sandstone with a smaller component of red shale. The climate is humid and is cool in summer and cold in winter.  Annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F). Annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm (32 to 70 in) and the frost free days range from 110 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 1100 m (1394 to 3608 ft) above sea level."

The moderately deep Mongaup and Vly soils are on nearby hilltops. The very deep, well drained Elka soils do not have fragipans and are on steeper or higher nearby hillsides."
