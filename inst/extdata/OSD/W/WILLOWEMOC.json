  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Willowemoc series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in till derived from sandstone, siltstone, and shale. They are nearly level to moderately steep soils on plains and hillsides on uplands. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high above the fragipan and low or moderately low in the fragipan and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is 7 degrees C (45 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 1120 mm (44 in).",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 89 to 190 cm (35 to 75 in). Depth to bedrock is greater than 152 cm (60 in). The depth to the fragipan ranges from 43 to 66 cm (17 to 26 in). Rock fragment content ranges from 5 to 40 percent by volume in the A and Bw horizons and from 15 to 50 percent in the Bx and C horizons. Unless limed, reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid in the solum and strongly acid to moderately acid in the C horizon. Redoximorphic features occur below 30 cm (12 in).\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3. Dry color value is 6 or more. It is silt loam to fine sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak to strong granular. Consistence is friable or very friable. O or E horizons are present in some pedons. Where present, the Ap can range up to 30 cm (12 in) thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. Structure is weak or moderate, granular, blocky, or prismatic.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. Prism face colors range from weak red (2.5YR 5/2) to pale brown (10YR 6/3). Structure is prismatic with ped interiors parting to platy or blocky structure or they are massive. Consistence is firm to extremely firm, although a subhorizon of the Bx may be firm. Gray or brown redoximorphic features may be present.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C or Cd horizon, where present, has color and texture similar to the Bx horizon, but lacks very coarse prismatic structure and is relatively more friable."

Annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 9 degrees C (39 to 48 degrees F). Annual precipitation ranges from 825 to 1790 mm (32 to 70 in) and the frost free days range from 110 to 155 days. Elevation ranges from 425 to 1100 m (1394 to 3608 ft) above sea level."
