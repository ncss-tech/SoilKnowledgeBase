Dovecanyon, Goldivide, Goldpeak, Helendale, Searchlight, Sonoita, and Tray soils are very deep. Dovecanyon soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 18 to 22 degrees C. Goldivide, Helendale, and Searchlight soils receive summer precipitation and are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative in some part of the soil moisture control section following summer convection storms. Goldivide soils also have secondary calcium carbonate at 25 to 75 centimeters and the depth to the top of the argillic horizon is 50 to 100 centimeters. Helendale soils also have secondary calcium carbonates at 100 to 150 centimeters. Searchlight soils are also calcareous throughout and moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline, and have a mean annual soil temperature of 19 to 22 degrees C. Sonoita soils also have secondary calcium carbonates at 25 to 75 centimeters and are moist for more than 20 days cumulative in some part of the moisture control section between July and October. Tray soils are also calcareous throughout and have strongly alkaline or very strongly alkaline argillic horizons with exchangeable sodium percentages (ESP) of 15 to 30 percent."
