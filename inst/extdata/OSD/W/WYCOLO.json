  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 11 to 21 inches.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.  Hue is 7.5YR through 2.5YR throughout.  The soil is dry in all parts more than half the time (cumulative) that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 5 degrees C. (41 F.) and never moist in some or all parts for as long as 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is above 8 degrees C. (47 F.).  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The mean summer soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is greater than 15 degrees C.  (59 F.).  The mean winter and summer soil temperatures differ by more than 5 degrees C. (9 F.).\nThe A horizon has value 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma 3 through 6 dry and moist.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe AB or BA horizon has value 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma 3 through 6 dry and moist.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe Bt horizon has value 3 through 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma 4 through 6 dry and moist.  Texture is sandy clay loam or loam with 18 to 30 percent clay with more than 35 percent fine sand or coarser.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 10 percent pebbles.\nThe Bk horizon has value 4 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma 3 through 6 dry and moist.  Texture is commonly clay loam or sandy clay loam, but the range includes sandy loam and loam.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent pebbles."
