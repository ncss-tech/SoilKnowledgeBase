Water rounded gravel are less than 5 percent in the A and upper Bt horizons and range from 0 to 15 percent in the lower Bt and C horizons. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid, except the surface layer where limed. Black and dark brown iron and manganese concretions range from none to common in each horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  Redoximorphic depletions with value of 4 or more and chroma 2 or less are within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon, but not within the upper 10 inches. Redoximorphic features range from few to common in shades of brown, red, black, or  gray Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe Btg horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2, or is neutral. Few to many redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, red, or black. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe BC, C or Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1  to 4, or is neutral. Redoximorphic features are in shades of brown, yellow, red, or gray and some pedons are an evenly mottled pattern without a dominant matrix color. Texture is loam, clay loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam and allows sub-horizons of silty clay or clay."

Beason soils have redox depletions in chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Cid soils have paralithic contact within 40 inches. Creedmore soils have sandy clay loam upper B horizons and clay lower B horizons that have a COLE of .09 or more. Dogue soils have less than 30 percent silt in the particle-size control section. Gritney soils typically are redder in the lower sola and have less than 30 percent silt in the control section. Helena and Lignum soils are on Piedmont uplands and formed in saprolite of metmorphic origin."
