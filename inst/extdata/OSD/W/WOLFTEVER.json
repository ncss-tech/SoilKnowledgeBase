Beason soils have redox depletions in chroma of 2 or less in the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon. Cid soils have paralithic contact within 40 inches. Creedmore soils have sandy clay loam upper B horizons and clay lower B horizons that have a COLE of .09 or more. Dogue soils have less than 30 percent silt in the particle-size control section. Gritney soils typically are redder in the lower sola and have less than 30 percent silt in the control section. Helena and Lignum soils are on Piedmont uplands and formed in saprolite of metmorphic origin."
