  "OVERVIEW": "The Washover series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from fanglomerate, limestone, dolomite, and quartzite. Washover soils are on young alluvial fans on mountain toeslopes. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
