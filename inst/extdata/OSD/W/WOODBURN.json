    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 45 to 80 consecutive days during the summer. The mean annual soil temperature is 52 to 55 degrees F. The soils are more than 60 inches deep. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick. Depth to aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less with or without redox concentrations is 20 to 30 inches. There are few to common, fine reddish brown or black concretions throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has weak to moderate granular ore subangular blocky structure. Texture is silt loam with 15 to 25 percent clay. It has 0 to 3 percent gravel. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe AB or BA horizons, when present, have value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. They have weak or moderate prismatic or subangular blocky structure. Texture is silt loam in the upper part and silt loam or silty clay loam in the lower part with 20 to 35 percent clay. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has weak to moderate prismatic or subangular blocky structure. Texture is loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.\nThe 2BCt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has weak prismatic or subangular blocky structure or is massive. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 or 7 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It has weak prismatic or subangular blocky structure or is massive.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Woodburn soils are on nearly level to gently sloping broad valley terraces formed in indistinctly stratified alluvium or lacustrine Willamette silt of upper Pleistocene age. The soils are at elevations of 150 to 400 feet above sea level. Slopes are 0 to 55 percent. The climate is composed of warm, dry summers, and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The mean January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amity, Aloha, Concord, Dayton and Willamette soils. Aloha soils do not have a mollic epipedon or an argillic horizon and are on terraces. Amity soils have an albic horizon, aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 10 to 20 inches, and occur in depressions or on less sloping position on terraces. Concord and Dayton soils have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 0 to 10 inches. In addition, Concord is fine and Dayton has an abrupt textural change from the E to 2Bt horizons. They occur in depressions on terraces. Willamette soils lack aquic conditions and chroma of 2 or less within 40 inches of the surface."
