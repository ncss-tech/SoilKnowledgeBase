Aloha soils do not have a mollic epipedon or an argillic horizon and are on terraces. Amity soils have an albic horizon, aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 10 to 20 inches, and occur in depressions or on less sloping position on terraces. Concord and Dayton soils have aquic conditions with chroma of 2 or less at a depth of 0 to 10 inches. In addition, Concord is fine and Dayton has an abrupt textural change from the E to 2Bt horizons. They occur in depressions on terraces. Willamette soils lack aquic conditions and chroma of 2 or less within 40 inches of the surface."
