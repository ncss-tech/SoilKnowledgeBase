  "OVERVIEW": "The Winlo series consist of shallow to pan somewhat poorly\ndrained soils that formed in alluvium.  They are on fan terraces\nand have slopes of 0 to 3 percent.  They are the intermound soil\non a pattern ground landscape.  The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53\ndegrees F.",

Depth to the duripan is 7 to 15 inches.  Depth\nto bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The textural control section averages 35 to 60 percent rock fragments of which 30 to 45\npercent are gravel and 5 to 15 percent are cobbles.  It has 40 to\n50 percent clay.  Prominent or distinct mottles are in the A and\nBw horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and\n4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 moist and 4\nor 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  The duripan is indurated throughout or indurated in some part.\nThe 2C has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist and 6\nor 7 dry, and chroma of 4 or 5 moist and 4 to 6 dry.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand with 50 to 60 percent gravel and 10 to 30\npercent cobbles.  Thin layers of loam and silt loam may occur in\nthis horizon."
