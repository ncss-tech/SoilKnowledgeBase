  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitinger series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from basalt.  Whitinger soils are on lava plateaus and mountains.  Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

The soil moisture control section (9 inches to the lithic contact or 9 to 27 inches) is dry from mid July to mid November (about 100 to 130 days) and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from April 15 to December 15 and exceeds 47 degrees F from May 15 to November 15.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and includes part of the Bt horizon.  Rock fragments on the surface, mostly stones and cobbles, range from 3 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/2, 4/3 or 4/2 or 7.5YR 5/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2, 2/2, 7.5YR 3/2 or 5YR 3/3.  It is stony or very stony loam with 20 to 25 percent clay and 15 to 50 percent rock fragments. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bt horizon color is 10YR 4/4, 4/3; 7.5YR 5/4, or 5/2.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 3/4, 3/3, 3/2; 7.5YR 3/4, 3/2, or 5YR 3/3 or 3/4.  It has a weighted average clay content of 27 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments average 35 to 60 percent mainly stones and cobbles.  Reaction is slightly acid to slightly alkaline."
