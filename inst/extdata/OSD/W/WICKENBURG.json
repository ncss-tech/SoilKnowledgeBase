  "OVERVIEW": "The Wickenburg series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium-colluvium. Wickenburg soils are on pediment hillslopes and mountain slopes with gradients of 1 to 65 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 68 degrees F.",

They formed in alluvium-colluvium from granitic rock and minor areas of volcanic rock.  Elevation is 1800 to 4000 feet. The climate is warm and semiarid continental. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain. Mean annual temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 220 to 275 days."
