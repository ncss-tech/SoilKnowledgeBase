    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wickenburg soils are on pediment hillslopes and mountain slopes with gradients of 1 to 65 percent. They formed in alluvium-colluvium from granitic rock and minor areas of volcanic rock.  Elevation is 1800 to 4000 feet. The climate is warm and semiarid continental. Average annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain. Mean annual temperature is 66 to 70 degrees F. The frost-free period is about 220 to 275 days."
