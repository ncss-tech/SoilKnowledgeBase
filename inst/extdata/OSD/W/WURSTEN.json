Bear Lake, Downata, and Inkom soils are on stream terraces close to the valley floor where associated with Wursten.   Hondoho and Arbone soils are mostly on north and east-facing slopes and in positions similar to Wursten but are more closely associated with higher broad fan terraces where the Joevar, Ririe, and Watercanyon soils are located.  Downey and Arimo soils are on broad terraces above the Wursten soils.  Arbone soils are not calcareous to the surface.  Arimo and Downey soils are underlain by sandy-skeletal material.  Bear Lake, Downata, and Inkom soils have an aquic moisture regime.  Hondoho soils are loamy-skeletal.  Joevar, Ririe, and Watercanyon soils are coarse-silty."
