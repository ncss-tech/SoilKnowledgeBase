  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodmont series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained soils with a slowly permeable fragipan in the subsoil.  These soils formed in old silty alluvium or a mixture of alluvium and loess on stream terraces, in depressions, and on broad upland flats.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.",
