    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid in the A and B horizon and ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline in and below the fragipan.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 3 percent above the fragipan and 0 to 10 percent in the fragipan.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe E horizon, where present, and E part of the E/B has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Few to common redoximorphic features in shades of brown or gray are present.  Texture is silt loam.\nSome pedons have a thin transitional horizon between the Ap or E horizon and the Bw horizon.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 3to 6.  Common to many redoximorphic features in shades of gray, brown, and black..  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe E/Bhas colors similar to the E and Bw horizons.  Texture is silt loam.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt or 2C horizon below 4 feet that formed in residuum of limestone."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Woodmont is the only series in this family. Bude, Calloway, Olivier, Necessity, and Taft are in closely related series.  Bude, Calloway, Olivier, and Necessity soils have more than 10 percent weatherable minerals in the sand and silt fractions.  Taft soils have less than 35 percent base saturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Woodmont soils are on upland flats, stream terraces, and in depressions.  Slope gradients generally are less than 2 percent.  The upper 4 to 6 feet of the soil has formed in older silty alluvium or mixed alluvium and loess over clayey limestone residuum at deeper depths.  Near the type location, the average annual temperature is about 58.1 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is about 53.1 inches."
