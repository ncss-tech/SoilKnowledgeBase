  "OVERVIEW": "The Wager series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Wager soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
