  "OVERVIEW": "The Walkup series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale and quartzite rocks.  Walkup soils are on alluvial flats.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
