    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wiregrass soils are on mountain slopes and broad ridgetops. Slope gradients are 0 to 75 percent. Elevations are 48 to 972 meters (155 to 3185 feet). These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from schist, sandstone, and mudstone. The climate is humid with cool, foggy summers and cool, rainy winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1900 to 2550 millimeters (75 to 100 inches). Mean January temperature is about 9 degrees C; mean July temperature is about 14 degrees C; and the mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is about 220 to 290 days."

Ahpah and Scaath soils are 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to bedrock. The Atwell and Devilscreek soils are in wet hillslope hollows below the Wiregrass soils. The Ahpah and Scaath soils are on convex slopes or on spur ridges above the Wiregrass soils. The Rockysaddle soils are alongside the Wiregrass soils on very gravelly colluvium. The Pittplace and Trailhead soils are above the Wiregrass soils on gentler slopes."
