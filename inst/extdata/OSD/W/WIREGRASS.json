  "OVERVIEW": "The Wiregrass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from schist, sandstone, and mudstone. Wiregrass soils are on mountains and have slopes of 0 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2290 millimeters (90 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F).",

Ahpah and Scaath soils are 50 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) deep to bedrock. The Atwell and Devilscreek soils are in wet hillslope hollows below the Wiregrass soils. The Ahpah and Scaath soils are on convex slopes or on spur ridges above the Wiregrass soils. The Rockysaddle soils are alongside the Wiregrass soils on very gravelly colluvium. The Pittplace and Trailhead soils are above the Wiregrass soils on gentler slopes."

Humult feature - organic carbon is 1.22 percent or more from 3 to 44 centimeters. (A, AB, & BAt horizons).\n5. Palehumult feature - clay maximum is 29.2 percent in BAt and exceeds 23.4 percent in (Bt1, Bt2, & Bt3 horizons).\n6. Particle-size control section - the zone from 12 to 62 centimeters, averages 28 percent clay, by weight, and 31 percent rock fragments, by volume. CEC/clay ratio averages 0.36.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soil sample 83-RNP-12 was collected at the type location and analyzed at the Oregon State University soil-testing laboratory. Soil sample S83-CA-012-06, from the type location, was analyzed by NSSL for clay mineralogy class placement.\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 83CA605REDW004\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
