  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches. The 10- to 40- inch particle-size control section is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay. Thin stratification of very fine sandy loam and clay are common below a depth of 20 inches. The soil is dry in some part of the moisture control section for four-tenths to six-tenths of the cumulative days during the growing season in most years. The organic carbon content is greater than 0.2 percent at a depth of 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. Where the A horizon has moist values and chroma of 3.5 or less, it is less than 10 inches thick. Texture is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline\nBuried A horizons are common. Where present, colors are similar to the A horizon. Textures are silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value 4 to 6, and chroma 4 to 6. Texture is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe BC, Bk or C horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 6. These horizons are weakly structured, structureless, or stratified with textures ranging from very fine sandy loam to silty clay loam. Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series in the same family. Similar soils are the Aspermont, Clairemont, Clemville, Guadalupe, Obaro, Westola, Weswood and Yahola series. Aspermont and Obaro soils have a regular decrease in organic matter. Clairemont soils do not have cambic horizons. Clemville soils have clayey layers in the lower part of the control section. Guadalupe, Westola and Yahola soils have coarse-loamy control sections. In addition, Yahola soils do not have cambic horizons. Weswood soils have coarse-silty control sections and are dry in the soil moisture control section for shorter periods."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wheatwood soils are on nearly level flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. These soils formed in stratified, calcareous, loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 65 degrees F. Frost free days range from 210 to 240 days, and elevation ranges from 900 to 1,950 feet. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 33 to 44."

Clairmont soils do not have a cambic horizon. Clearfork and Mangum soils have greater than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Port soils have a thick mollic epipedon. Westola soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section."
