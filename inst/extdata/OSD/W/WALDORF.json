  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates ranges from 26 to 55 inches.  The mollic epipedon thickness ranges from 16 to 24 inches.  The particle-size control section typically averages between 40 and 50 percent clay, and less than 10 percent fine sand and coarser.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 0.  It is silty clay loam or silty clay.  It is neutral or slightly acid.  The AB horizon when present, has colors and textures similar to the A horizons.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Faces of peds are 1 or 2 units lower in value or chroma or both than the matrix in most parts of the Bg horizon.  The Bg horizon typically is silty clay, but silty clay loam or clay is within the range.  The Bg horizon typically is neutral but the lower part of it in some pedons is slightly alkaline.\nSome pedons have a Bkg horizon within a 60-inch depth.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 or 2 and commonly contains redoximorphic features.  Typically it is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay, but silt loam is within the range.  Also, it has strata of clay loam or loam in some pedons below depths of 48 inches.  It is friable or firm.  Moist bulk density ranges from 1.25 to 1.45 g/cc.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are in the Cosmos and Marna Series.  When previously classified in the Typic Haplaquolls subgroup, the competing series were Chequest, Kalona, Lanyon, and Streator series.  Cosmos soils have a bulk density greater than 1.6 gm/cc in the lower part of the series control section and below.  Marna soils have more than 10 percent sand in the lower one-third of the series control section.  Chequest soils do not have secondary carbonates within the series control section.  Kalona soils average less than 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Lanyon soils have secondary calcium carbonates within 20 inches of the surface.  Streator soils have a moist bulk density greater than 1.45 gm/cc in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on plane to slightly concave positions on lake plains or moraines covered by lacustrine sediments.  Slope gradients are 0 to 2 percent.  The Waldorf soils formed in fine or moderately fine textured lacustrine sediments that are 4 to more than 10 feet in thickness.  These sediments are Late Wisconsin in age.  The climate is midcontinental with warm summers and cold winters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 45 to 50 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 to 32 inches.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1200 feet.  Frost-free days range from 124 to 172."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The Collinwood, Brownton, Lura, and Kamrar soils are the major ones.  These soils formed in similar sediments and are members of a hydrosequence with Waldorf soils.  The well-drained Kamrar soils are on backslopes, shoulders and summits.  The moderately well and somewhat poorly drained Collinwood soils are on nearby low summits.  The poorly and very poorly drained calcareous Brownton soils are on nearby nearly level positions on rims of depressions.  Lura soils are very poorly drained and are in depression."
