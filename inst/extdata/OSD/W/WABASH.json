  "OVERVIEW": "The Wabash series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on flood plains in river valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C. Mean annual precipitation is about 900 millimeters.",
