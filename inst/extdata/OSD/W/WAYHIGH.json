  "OVERVIEW": "The Wayhigh series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from quartzite with minor amounts of limestone. Wayhigh soils are on mountains. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
