  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Waiakea soils are on the east slopes on the undissected upland of Mauna Loa volcano and on younger lava flows of northeast windward slopes of Mauna Kea volcano at elevations from 336 to 1646 meters (1100 to 5400 feet). The soils are on all hill slope positions of constructional landscapes consisting of undulating to hilly `a`a flows that are 1,500 to 10,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 2 to 35 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash in `a`a lava. The mean annual rainfall typically ranges from 3800 to 5100 millimeters (150 to 200 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. Some areas of Waiakea soils that occur on Mauna Kea have mean annual rainfall ranging from 1270 to 2286 millimeters (50 to 90 inches). The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 762 to 1016 millimeters (30 to 40 inches). Precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration all months of normal years, except in the drier areas of Mauna Kea described above where the soil is typically moist throughout the profile but may experience periodic drying of the control section less than 90 cumulative days, usually during the months of April to October.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 16 to 22 degrees C (61 to 72 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F)."
