  "OVERVIEW": "The Winkler series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium derived mainly from argillite, quartzite and breccia tuff. These soils are on mountains, hills, and escarpments.  Slopes are 8 to 85 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
