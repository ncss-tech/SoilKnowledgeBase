  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The combined thickness of the A horizons is less than 20 inches.  Texture is loam or silt loam and reaction ranges from slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR, values of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1\nto 3.  Coarse fragments less than 3 inches range from 0 to 5\npercent by volume.\nThe A2 horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, values of 5 or 6,\nand chroma of 2 to 6.  The boundary between the lower A horizon\nand the upper B horizon is clear or abrupt with an abrupt textural change.   Some pedons have as much as 15 percent interfingering of\nA2 horizon into the upper 1 to 3 inches of the B2t horizon.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, values of 4 or 5, and\nchroma of 4 to 6.  It has mottles in shades of gray, brown, red,\nor yellow.  The lower part also includes mottled matrix in shades\nof brown, gray, or yellow.  It is silty clay, clay, silty clay\nloam, or clay loam; medium acid to very strongly acid in the upper part and medium acid to moderately alkaline in the lower part.\nThe B3 horizon, where present, has color, texture, and reaction similar to that of the lower B2t horizon.  It contains a few shale fragments.\nThe Cr horizon is olive or gray shale that is slightly weathered\nand can be dug with a spade with some difficulty.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline.  It is tilted 10\ndegrees to 60 degrees from the horizontal."

Arriola soils have base saturation of 35 to 60 percent immediately above the paralithic contact and have solums\n20 to 40 inches thick.  Barden, Grubbs, Liberal, Sobol, and Tupelo soils lack abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons.  Cadeville soils have upper Bt horizon colors in 2.5YR and 5YR\nhues.  Counts soils have more than 60 inches of solum thickness.  Homa soils have more than 60 percent clay in the control section.  Orange soils have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Tuskahoma soils\nhave a solum less than 20 inches thick."

Sobol and Tuskahoma soils are on slightly higher convex ridges.  Burwell soils occur on mounds,\nhave fine-silty control sections and are more than 60 inches\nthick.  Collinsville soils occur on ridges, lack Bt horizons and\nhave solums 10 to 20 inches thick.  Moyers soils occur on similar positions of the landscape and lack abrupt textural change between the A and B horizons.  Stigler and Vian soils occur on similar positions of the landscape but they have thicker solums.  Wing\nsoils have matrix horizons and occur in concave circular areas\nwithin Wister soils."
