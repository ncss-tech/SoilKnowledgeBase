Absaquil soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Apt soils have 50 to 60 percent clay in the argillic horizon and lack a very gravelly 2C horizon.  Hazelcamp, McDuff, and Peavine soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Skookumhouse soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock and lack a very gravelly 2C horizon."

The soils formed in mixed alluvium.  Elevation is 50 to 800 feet.  The climate is characterized by warm wet winters and hot moist summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 60 to 100 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 160 to 240 days.  The soils are on the Pioneer geomorphic surface."
