    "content": "REMARKS: This series was formerly included with the Zion series. Zion soils have hard, unweathered bedrock at depths of 51 to 102 centimeters (20 to 40 inches) and are now mesic due to the thermic/mesic break in MLRA 136. The September 2025 revision reformatted the description to semi-tabular. No data was changed.\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 36 centimeters (0 to 14 inches) (Ap, E, and EB horizons)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 36 to 71 centimeters (14 to 28 inches) (Bt and BC horizon).\nParalithic contact--the occurrence of weathered bedrock at a depth of 71 centimeters (28 inches) (upper boundary of the Cr horizon)."
