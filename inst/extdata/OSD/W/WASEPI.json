    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wasepi soils are on outwash plains, deltas, valley trains, glacial drainageways, and lake plains of Wisconsinan Age. Slope gradient is dominantly 0 and 2 percent, but ranges to 6 percent. This soil formed in loamy and sandy glaciofluvial deposits underlain by sand and gravel at 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Mean annual precipitation ranges from 737 to 940 mm (29 to 37 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F)."

The Wasepi soils are the somewhat poorly drained member of a drainage sequence that includes the well drained Boyer, moderately well drained Perrin, and poorly drained or very poorly drained Gilford soils. Brady, the well drained Oshtemo, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Sebewa soils are closely associated on outwash plains."
