  "OVERVIEW": "The Wasepi series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy glaciofluvial deposits underlain by sand and gravel at 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Wasepi soils are on outwash plains, deltas, valley trains, glacial drainageways, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 838 mm (33 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",
