  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is about 49 to 53 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F. under a closed canopy. The soil is usually moist and is dry for less than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The solum has an estimated P-retention of 95 to 100 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 3.0 to 5.0 percent, and 15-bar moisture (dried) of 20 to 35 percent. Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches. Depth to the 2C horizon is 24 to 36 inches. The umbric epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick. Soil reaction is very strongly or strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It is weakly to moderately smeary. It has 5 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles. The moist bulk density is 0.50 to 0.80 grams per cubic centimeter. It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is medial loam or medial sandy loam with an estimated clay content of 5 to 15 percent. It has 15 to 35 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 15 percent rounded cobbles. The moist bulk density is 0.75 to 0.85 grams per cubic centimeter.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 moist and dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, or coarse sand with 50 to 60 percent rounded gravel and 0 to 15 percent rounded cobbles. Stratification is common."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wolfer soils are on stream terraces of Senecal (Whiskey Run) age at elevations of 100 to 300 feet. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. They formed in silty over sandy and gravelly alluvium of predominantly igneous origin. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and cool moist summers. The mean annual precipitation is 70 to 100 inches. The mean January temperature is about 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 63 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F. The frost-free period is 160 to 260 days."

The contrasting family is based on a weighted average of the zone from 0 to 29 inches (medial) and the contrasting zone from 29 to 40 inches (sandy or sandy-skeletal).\nReclassified on 11/04 from Typic Melanudands to Typic Fulvudands. Reclassification based on the epipedon value and chroma, moist, overlapping Melanudands and Fulvudands color criteria and an estimated melanic index of 1.75 to 2.0 based on data collected from associated soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
