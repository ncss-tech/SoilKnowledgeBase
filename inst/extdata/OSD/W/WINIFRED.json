  "OVERVIEW": "The Winifred series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from semiconsolidated shale or in alluvium over the deposited semiconsolidated shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains, hills, and escarpments.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
