  "OVERVIEW": "The Wahi series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in basic volcanic ash deposited over basic `a`a lava.  Slopes range from 2 to 20 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1,473 millimeters (58 inches), and the mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F).",
