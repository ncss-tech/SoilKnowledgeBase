  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilsey series consists of very deep well drained soils on flood plains and upland drainageways. These soils formed in calcareous alluvium. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 74 centimeters (29 inches).",
