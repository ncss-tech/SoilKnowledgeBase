  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slope gradients range from 0 to 6 percent but typically are less than 3 percent. Wanblee soils are in micro-lows within the landscape.  They formed in residuum weathered from soft siltstone.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 18 inches."
