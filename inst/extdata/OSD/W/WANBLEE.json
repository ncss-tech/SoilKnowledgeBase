  "OVERVIEW": "The Wanblee series consists of moderately deep, well drained, or moderately well drained soils formed in residuum weathered from siltstone on upland fans and flats.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
