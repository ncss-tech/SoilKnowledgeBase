  "REVDATE": "02/2000",
  "STATES": "NY,VT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wappinger series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains. These soils formed in recent alluvium derived from upland areas dominated by slaty or shaly till.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 39 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 45 inches and the depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Rock fragments, mainly gravel and cobbles, range from 0 to 10 in the solum and upper part of the C horizon and 15 to 70 percent in the 2C horizon. Unless limed, reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately acid above 20 inches and moderately acid to neutral below 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or loam. Structure is weak or moderate, medium or fine granular structure. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 or 4. Textures are loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam. They have weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky or granular structure. Consistence is friable or very friable. Some pedons have a BC horizon.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 or 4.  Mottles are common in some pedons.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon has hues of 10YR and 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4 and may be mottled. Texture is loamy sand or sand in the fine earth fraction. It is massive or single grain. Consistence is very friable or loose."

Barbour soils have less than 60 percent base saturation within a depth of 30 inches and have hues redder than 7.5YR in the upper part of the B horizon. Comus, Linden, Ondawa, Pope and Tioga soils all lack a sandy or sandy-skeletal particle size class within a depth of 40 inches. In addition, Comus, Linden, Ondawa, and Pope have less than 60 percent base saturation within a depth of 30 inches."

They formed in loamy alluvium overlying sandy deposits washed from upland soils formed mainly from shale and slate rocks. The mean annual temperature ranges from 48 to 52 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches; and the frost-free season ranges from 125 to 175 days. The elevation is 50 to 500 feet above sea level."
