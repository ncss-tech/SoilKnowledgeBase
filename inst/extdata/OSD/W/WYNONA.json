Mean annual precipitation ranges from 914 to 1067 mm (36 to 42 inches).  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13.9 to 17.2 degrees C (57 degrees to 63 degrees F.)  Elevation is 165 to 385 meters (541 to 1263 feet) above mean sea level.  Thornthwaite P-E indices are from 60 to 76."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Verdigris series.  The Mason, Tullahasse, and Osage series.  Mason soils have argillic horizons, lack redoximorphic features in the mollic epipedon, and are rarely flooded.  Osage soils have a fine control section and have high shrink-swell properties.  Verdigris soils are well drained and can be rarely to frequently flooded.  Tullahassee soils have a coarse loamy control section and contain an ochric epipedon."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table is with 61 cm (2 feet) between November and April in normal years.  Potential for surface runoff is negligible to medium.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low.  Wynona series is subject to occasional flooding for very brief periods between January and July in normal years."
