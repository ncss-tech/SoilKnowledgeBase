  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wynona series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to slightly concave flood plains which drain the Cherokee Prairies (MLRA 112).  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 991 mm (39 inches), mean annual air temperature is about 15.6 degrees C (60 degrees F).",

Mason soils have argillic horizons, lack redoximorphic features in the mollic epipedon, and are rarely flooded.  Osage soils have a fine control section and have high shrink-swell properties.  Verdigris soils are well drained and can be rarely to frequently flooded.  Tullahassee soils have a coarse loamy control section and contain an ochric epipedon."
