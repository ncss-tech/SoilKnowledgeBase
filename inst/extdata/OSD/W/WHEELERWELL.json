  "OVERVIEW": "The Wheelerwell series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from quartzite and some dolomite. Wheelerwell soils are on backslopes of hills. Slope ranges from 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
