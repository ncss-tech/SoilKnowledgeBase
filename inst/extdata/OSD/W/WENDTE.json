  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The control section typically averages between 40 and 60 percent clay.  Typically, the soil is calcareous throughout but contains thin strata that are noncalcareous in some pedons.  Some pedons are leached of carbonates to about 10 inches. Thin buried A horizons are below a depth of 20 inches in some pedons. The soil is slightly or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y hue, value of 4 or 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It commonly is clay or silty clay and less commonly silty clay loam or clay loam. The C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It typically is stratified clay and silty clay loam in the lower part but includes clay loam and silty clay. Some pedons have a few thin layers of contrasting coarser textures that are 1/8 to 2 inches thick, but these constitute less than 20 percent of the control section.  Few to common mottles are below a depth of 20 inches in some pedons.  Few fine soft accumulations of carbonates and gypsum are in the C horizon in some pedons.  Textures ranging from loam to sand and gravel are between a depth of 40 and 60 inches in some pedons."

The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 15 to 24 inches."

Bullcreek and Promise soils have a very-fine textured control section, and are on foot slopes and fans above areas of Wendte soils.  In addition, Bullcreek soils contain an appreciable amount of salts. Munjor soils have a coarse-loamy control section and are in the same positions in the landscapes.  Nimbro soils have a fine-loamy control section and are in the same landscape."
