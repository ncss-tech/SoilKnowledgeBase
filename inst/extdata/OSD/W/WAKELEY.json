The Wakeley soils formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits underlain by clayey lacustrine deposits on glacial lake plains and outwash plains. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 813 mm (28 to 32 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 4.4 to 7.2 degrees C (40 to 45 degrees F)."

The somewhat poorly drained Au Gres and the moderately well drained Croswell soils are on slightly higher landscape positions. The very poorly drained Leafriver and Tawas soils are in depressions or on similar landscape positions and have a thicker mantle of organic material."

Depth to a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between October and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very in the sandy material and low or moderately low in the clayey material. Permeability is rapid in the sandy material and slow or very slow in the clayey material."
