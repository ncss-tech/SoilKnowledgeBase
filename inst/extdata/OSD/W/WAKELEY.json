  "STATES": "MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wakeley series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed in sandy outwash or lacustrine deposits underlain by clayey lacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains and outwash plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 762 mm (30 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 6.1 degrees C (43 degrees F).",
