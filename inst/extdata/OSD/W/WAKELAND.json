  "OVERVIEW": "The Wakeland series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps. Slopes are from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F), and the mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches).",

Permeability is moderate. The potential for surface water runoff is low to negligible. In undrained areas, depth to an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 0.15 to 0.5 meters (0.5 to 1.5 feet) from November through May in normal years. In drained areas, the intermittent apparent high water table is 0.15 to 0.6 meters (0.5 to 2 feet) from December to April in normal years. This soil is subject to frequent to rare periods of flooding."
