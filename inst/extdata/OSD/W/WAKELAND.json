    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wakeland soils are on nearly level flood plains and flood-plain steps. They are formed in silty alluvium. The soil moisture control section is not dry in all parts for more than 60 cumulative days per year. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F), mean annual soil temperature at a depth of 51 cm (20 inches) ranges from 11 to 15 degrees C (52 to 59 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 1016 to 1168 mm (40 to 46 inches), frost free period ranges from 170 to 210 days, and elevation ranges from 104 to 290 meters (340 to 950 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s). Permeability is moderate. The potential for surface water runoff is low to negligible. In undrained areas, depth to an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 0.15 to 0.5 meters (0.5 to 1.5 feet) from November through May in normal years. In drained areas, the intermittent apparent high water table is 0.15 to 0.6 meters (0.5 to 2 feet) from December to April in normal years. This soil is subject to frequent to rare periods of flooding."
