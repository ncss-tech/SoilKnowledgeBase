  "OVERVIEW": "The Wistona series consists of very deep, well drained soils on flood plains and low terraces.  They formed in alluvium.  Permeability is moderate.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The average annual temperature is about 53 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",
