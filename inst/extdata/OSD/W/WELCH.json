    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nSoil moisture: Welch soils are saturated and have aquic conditions for a least one month during normal years.  Aquic conditions are often present at or near the soil surface, mainly during the late winter and early spring months. The water table drops to a depth of 46 to 90 cm from early spring through September.\nMean annual soil temperature: 5 to 8 degrees C.\nMollic epipedon thickness: 66 to over 150 cm, organic matter decreases irregularly with depth.\nProfile reaction: Slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nOther features: The parent material typically has a large amount of vitric pyroclastic material such as volcanic ash.  Buried A horizons are common.  Some pedons have gravelly strata or strata of silty clay loam, silt loam, clay, loam, very fine sandy loam, or sandy loam.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Averages 27 to 35 percent.\nA and ACg horizons\nHue: 10YR through 5Y or neutral (N).\nValue: 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist.\nChroma: 0 through 3 in the upper part and 0 through 2 in the lower part.\nRedoximorphic features:  Few to many, fine or medium, distinct or prominent zones of iron or manganese accumulation either lining pores or as masses within the matrix. Zones of iron depletion may also be present.\nCg and C horizons\nHue: 10YR through 5B, or neutral (N).\nValue: 5 through 8 dry, 3 through 5 moist.\nChroma: 0 through 2.\nStructure: Prismatic or is massive.\nTexture: Stratified sandy loam to silty clay loam, stratified very fine sandy loam to gravelly clay loam, or stratified sandy clay loam to silty clay loam.  Some pedons have horizons below 100 cm that are stratified very gravelly loamy sand to extremely gravelly coarse sand.\nConsistence: Slightly hard or hard dry, very friable or friable moist.  Slightly sticky or moderately sticky and slightly plastic or moderately plastic.\nRedoximorphic features: None to many, fine to coarse zones of iron or manganese accumulation either lining pores or as masses within the matrix.  Zones of iron depletion may also be present."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Chamita, Cometcrik, Eagleton, Eastdale, Kerkhoven, Kovich, Lakepark, Lobe, Mannixlee, Marshbrook, Marshdale, Nythar, and Sibannac series.\nEagleton and Sibannac soils lack a component of vitric pyroclastic materials in the series control section. Eastdale slois have aquic conditions at 61 to 152 cm. Kovich soils have a loamy-skeletal lithologic discontinuity within 100 cm. Lobe soils have 18 to 24 percent clay. Chamita soils contain 18 to 27 percent clay. Lakepark soils are not dry in the soil moisture control section for 35 to 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Marshbrook soils are more moist during spring and summer and have a regular decrease in organic carbon with depth. Marshdale soils have a regular decrease in organic carbon with depth, have structural B horizons, and have calcareous substrata below 100 cm. Sibannac soils are more moist and have structural B horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Welch soils are on flood plains, stream terraces, and inset fans. They formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks and vitric pyroclastic materials (glassy volcanic ash).  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Elevations range from 1,340 to 2,805 meters.  The climate is cool-semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 230 to 400 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 60 to 100 days.  In parts of Idaho where this soil occurs, the frost-free period is as few as 45 days."

Home Camp soils are well drained, clayey-skeletal, have argillic horizons, and have a cryic soil temperature regime. Newlands soils are well drained, deep to hard bedrock, have argillic horizons, and have a cryic soil temperature regime."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained or very poorly drained, except where drained by gullying and entrenchment of adjacent creek channels. These soils are kept wet through most of the growing season by spring water and runoff from surrounding areas; very low or low surface runoff; moderately high saturated hydraulic conductivity.  These soils have flooding frequency ranging from non-flooded to frequently flooded.  A seasonal high water table is present between the soil surface and 46 cm (Very shallow or Shallow free water occurrence class) for some time in normal years.  Cumulative annual duration class is Persistent (November through June). The water table during much of the growing season ranges from 46 to 90 cm.  Drained phases and ponded phases of this series are recognized."
