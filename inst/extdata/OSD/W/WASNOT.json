  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 6 to 17 inches. Depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments, of glacially subrounded or triangulated sandstone and siltstone, range from 20 to 70 percent in the surface horizon and 35 to 70 percent in the subsoil. Reaction is very strongly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is very channery, flaggy, or stony loam, sandy loam or loamy sand. It has weak fine granular structure.\nThe E horizon has hues and chromas similar to the A horizon, but with values of 4 or 5. Textures are similar to the Bw horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. It is very channery, flaggy, or stony sandy loam or loamy sand. It has weak fine and medium subangular blocky structure.\nSome pedons have thin C horizons with hues of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, values of 4 to 6, and chromas of 4 or 6. There can be some uncoated sands with lower chromas. It is very channery, flaggy, or stony sandy loam or loamy sand."

Slope ranges from 3 to 70 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 40 inches. The growing season ranges from 90 to 110 days."

All the soils except Skytop soils are in a mesic temperature regime and lower on the landscape. Arnot is the mesic equivalent of Wasnot. Lordstown soils are in a coarse-loamy family. Oquaga and Skytop soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches. Swartswood and Wurstboro soils have fragipans."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The soil separates the frigid part of Arnot soils. Siliceous mineralogy is assumed from nearby soils sampled on similar rock formations.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the mineral surface of the soil to a depth of about 3 inches (A horizon).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 3 inches to a depth of about 18 inches (Bw horizons).\n3. CEC activity class is estimated from data on similar parent materials.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
