  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is more than 80 inches.  The clay content of the control section ranges from 18 to 30 percent.  Some pedons have a few siliceous or ironstone pebbles that make less than 5 percent by volume.  The reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout unless limed.\nThe A horizon has colors with hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Horizons with value of 3 are less than 7 inches thick.  The texture is loamy fine sand or fine sand.\nThe E horizon has colors with hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Some pedons have a BE horizon with chroma of 6 or 8.  The texture of the E or BE horizon is loamy fine sand or fine sand.\nThe Bt horizon has matrix colors with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles of these colors and mottles in shades of red, yellow, brown or gray range from none to common.  Some pedons have a mottled matrix of these colors in the lower part and below a depth of 40 inches.  Mottles with chroma of 2 or less are below a depth of 30 inches.  The texture is mainly sandy clay loam, however some pedons have clay loam or fine sandy loam horizons.  Clean sand and silt in streaks or pockets range from none to about 15 percent by volume but typically makes up 3 to 10 percent of a lower Bt/E horizon. Some pedons have up to 4 percent plinthite nodules or more than 5 percent plinthite below a depth of 60 inches."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These include the Larton and Larue series in the same family and the similar Briley, Heatly, Heaton, Lilbert, Nobscot, Pickton and Silstid soils.  Larton and Larue soils have argillic horizons with hue redder than 7.5YR, in addition Larton soils have control sections with less than 18 percent clay.  Briley and Lilbert soils have base saturation of less than 35 percent.  Heatly, Heaton, Nobscot and Silstid soils are members of the ustic moisture regime.  Pickton soils have grossarenic surfaces."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wolfpen soils occupy nearly level to moderately steep uplands of the Coastal Plain.  The soils formed in lentil sands mainly of the Queen City and Wilcox Geologic Group.  Slopes are mainly 1 to 4 percent but range up to about 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 40 to 50 inches, average annual temperature is 64 to 66 degrees F., and the Thornthwaite P-E index is about 68.  Frost free days range from 235 to 270 and elevation is 400 to 700 feet above sea level."
