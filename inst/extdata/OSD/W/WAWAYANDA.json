  "OVERVIEW": "The Wawayanda series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in well decomposed organic materials. Organic deposits are 16 to 46 inches thick and overlie coprogenous earth (sedimentary peat) deposits (the coprogenous earth material may qualify as an organic material) that are 3 to 34 inches thick. Mineral soil materials occur within a depth of 51 inches from the surface. Wawayanda soils occur in bogs and old lake plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The organic layers are 16 to 46 inches thick and may overlie coprogenous earth deposits (the coprogenous earth material may also qualify as an organic material) that are 3 to 34 inches thick. Mineral soil materials occur below the coprogenous earth within a depth of 51 inches from the surface. Reaction in the organic materials and coprogenous earth ranges from strongly acid through slightly alkaline, and ranges from moderately acid through moderately alkaline in the mineral materials.\nThe surface tier typically is black (N 2/0 and 5YR 2.5/1) sapric material. A few pedons have sapric materials mixed with hemic or mineral materials as a result of drainage ditch spoil being spread, and subsequently, incorporated into the surface. The structure of the surface tier is weak or moderate granular. Some pedons have weak blocky structure below the plow zone, which parts to platy or granular. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe subsurface tier has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 3. Chroma or value may change up to 2 units upon rubbing. Broken faces often become darker upon brief exposure to air. The layer is dominated by sapric material with a rubbed fiber content of less than 16 percent of the organic volume. Structure is typically weak or moderate platy or blocky. A few pedons are massive. Consistence is friable or very friable. Some pedons have a thin layer in the upper part of this tier with aggregates that are dense and firm, but break abruptly under pressure. Some pedons have thin layers of hemic material that are less than 10 inches thick.\nThe coprogenous earth layers have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 5GY; value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 through 3. Redoximorphic features are usually present around old root channels. Many pedons have variable amounts of recognizable herbaceous and woody fibers. Structure is platy but, some pedons are coarse or very coarse blocky or prismatic that breaks to platy. Vertical cracks are often present which may become filled with sapric material from the overlying layers. Consistence is friable moist but, it becomes firm or hard upon drying, and may be slightly brittle. Many pedons contain coprogenous earth that is plastic or slightly plastic when wet. The coprogenous earth is usually organic but, some pedons have as little as 6% organic carbon.\nThe mineral layers have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, 5BG, 5B, or are neutral. Value ranges from 3 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture of the mineral fine earth fraction is usually fine sandy loam, loam, or silty clay loam. In some pedons layers of mineral materials will range from sand through clay. A few pedons contain thin gravelly mineral layers. The layers are usually massive or single grain. Some pedons have inherited platy structure. Consistence ranges from loose through friable when moist, and nonsticky & nonplastic through sticky & plastic when wet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were originally included with the Carlisle and Palms series in previous mapping in New York.\nLab data confirms most areas are euic with lesser amounts of dysic soils. It is possible the NY areas were originally dysic before being drained, cultivated, and limed.\nIn addition to the coprogenous earth layers being largely organic, they often appear to show signs of pedogenesis. The Lco1 does not technically qualify as coprogenous earth material due to the value of 5. To default back to an O horizon seems to be unreasonable. Therefore, it is suggested that a different horizon designation be established for these types of layers.\nThese layers are often \"rubbery\" in feel when wet. Upon drying they have an appearance of stacked plates that resemble the bottom of a pile of partially decomposed leaves. When these layers are viewed from an extensive exposure that has been slightly weathered (such as face of long and deep drainage ditch) they often have the appearance of fractured limestone bedrock. The pattern of both vertical and horizontal cracks are quite evident, along with the organic material fillings in the vertical cracks. Also evident on individual plates of the dried material are many old root channels surrounded by a ring of relic (?) iron accumulations or oxidized rhizospheres.\nDiagnostic horizons or features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Histic epipedon - 0 to 45 inches (0p, Oa1, Oa2, Lco1, Lco2, and Lco3 horizons)\n2. Limnic materials (coprogenous earth) - 22 to 45 inches (Lco1, Lco2, and Lco3 horizons)."
