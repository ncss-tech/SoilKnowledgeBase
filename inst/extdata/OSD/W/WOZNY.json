  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of silty mantle ranges from 12 to 36 inches. Depth to the densic contact ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Content of clay averages from 7 to 17 percent in the particle-size control section and the content of sand coarser than very fine averages 15 to 70 percent. Coarse fragments are dominantly of igneous origin and are of mixed lithology. Total volume of rock fragment ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, 0 to 25 percent in the loamy alluvium, and 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the silty mantle, from 0 to 20 percent in the loamy alluvium, and from 5 to 35 percent in the dense till. Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 3 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 5 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Volume of stones ranges from 0 to 1 percent in the silty mantle and from 0 to 3 percent in the loamy alluvium and in the dense till. Surface stones have coverage ranging from 0 to 3 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly in the silty mantle and in the loamy alluvium, and from strongly acid to neutral in the dense till. Masses of iron accumulations occur in all layers above the densic contact. Aquic conditions occur within 12 inches at some time in normal years.\nOa horizon\nHue: 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: muck\nSome pedons have an A horizon\nHue: 10YR\nValue: 2 or 3\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: silt loam.\nEg horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: silt loam or silty clay loam.\nBtg horizon\nHue: 7.5YR or 10YR\nValue: 4 to 6\nChroma: 1 or 2\nTexture: silt loam.\n2C horizon\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 3 to 6\nChroma: 3 to 4\nTexture: stratified loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silt loam, or their gravelly analogs.Bulk density: 1.65 to 1.85 gm/cc.\n3Cd horizon\nHue: 5YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 3 to 4\nChroma: 4\nTexture: predominantly loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand, but some pedons have sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam textures.

Permeability is moderate in the silty mantle, moderately slow in the loamy alluvium, and slow in the dense till. Wozny soils have seasonal saturation perched above the densic contact at a depth of 1 foot above the surface to 0.5 foot below the surface for a long duration at some time during the period September to June in normal years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: These soils are used for woodland. Native vegetation is mixed deciduous and coniferous forest. Common trees are cedar, tamarack, spruce, ash, maple, balsam, aspen, birch, hemlock, and elm. Where the forest cover has been removed, vegetation is mostly grasses and sedges with some shrubs, such as alder and willow."
