  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 15 percent in each horizon.  The fragments are rounded and are mostly less than 3 inches across.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid except where the soil has been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 (or value of 3 less than 6 inches thick,) and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, silt loam or sandy loam.\nMost pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and the Bt horizon and between the Bt and C horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 chroma of 4 to 8.  Mottles of chroma 2 or less are present within the upper 30 inches of soil.  It is loam, clay loam, sandy clay loam, silt loam or silty clay loam and some pedons have thin subhorizons of sandy loam.  The silt content is more than 25 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 2 to 8.  Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or sandy loam."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Columbus, Eunola, and Mazarn series in the same family, and the Pelion, Sequatchie, Slagle, and Swafford series in related families. The Mollicy and Yauhannah series are former competing series that have not been reclassified to the current edition of Soil Taxonomy.  Columbus, Eunola, Pelion, Slagle, and Yauhannah soils developed from fluvial and/or marine sediments in Southern Coastal Plain.  Mazarn soils formed in sediments from shale, silstone, and sandstone and have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Sequatchie soils have a dark surface layer and are well drained.  Swafford soils are normally a few feet higher and have 40 to 60 percent brittleness in part of the Bt horizon."
