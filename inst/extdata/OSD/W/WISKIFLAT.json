  "OVERVIEW": "The Wiskiflat series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from predominantly granitic rocks with volcanic ash influence throughout.  Wiskiflat soils are on alluvial fans and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
