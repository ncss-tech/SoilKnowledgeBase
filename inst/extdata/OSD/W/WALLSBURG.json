Ateron soils have rock fragments that are mostly basalt, andesite, tuff or greenstone lithologies. Camool soils contain 7 to 25 percent volcanic glass in the top 5 to 9 inches.  Canest, Douhide, and Harlow soils have less than 50 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Chen soils have an abrupt textural A-B boundary. Graley soils have a mollic epipedon that does not include the argillic and the particle-size control section contains dominantly gravel size rock fragments. Itca soils have an abrupt boundary between the A and Bt horizon with prismatic structure in the Bt horizon.  Vannob soils have less than 50 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wallsburg soils are on gently sloping ridges and steep to very steep mountain slopes at elevations of 5,500 to 9,400 feet (1,676 to 2,870 m). Commonly they occur on south exposures. Slopes are 15 to 70 percent. These soils formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or residuum derived from sandstone and shale but include some limestone and basic igneous rocks. The climate is moist subhumid. The mean annual air temperature is 38 to 45 degrees F (3.5 to 7.2 degrees C.), and the mean summer temperature is 56 to 65 degrees F (13.3 to 18.3 degrees C.) Mean annual precipitation is 16 to 25 inches (406 to 635 mm). The frost-free period is 60 to 100 days."

All of these soils lack a lithic contact at a depth of 20 inches (51 cm) or less. Bradshaw soils have very cobbly very fine sandy loam weak B horizons. Burgi soils have mollic epipedons more than 20 inches (51 cm) thick, lack argillic horizons and have gravelly loam particle-size control section. Cloud Rim soils have loam argillic horizons with less than 20 percent coarse fragments. Hades soils have mollic epipedons thicker than 51 cm. Harter soils have more than 35 percent clay in the fine particle-size control section."
