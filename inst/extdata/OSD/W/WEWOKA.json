  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to a paralithic contact with conglomerate is 20 to 40 inches. The reaction of all horizons ranges from very strongly acid through neutral.\nThe A horizon is brown (10YR 5/3), grayish brown (10YR 5/2), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  It is a sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Rounded chert pebbles, 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter range from 10 to 45 percent by volume and cobbles from 3 to 10 inches in diameter ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe E horizon is pink (7.5YR 7/4), light brown (7.5YR 6/4, 6/3), brown (7.5YR 5/3), or reddish yellow (7.5YR 7/6).  It is gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly loamy sand.  Rounded chert pebbles 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter range from 20 to 75 percent by volume and cobbles from 3 to 10 inches in diameter range from 0 to 5 percent by volume.\nThe B horizon is reddish yellow (5YR 7/6), reddish brown (5YR 5/4), pink (7.5YR 7/4), or light brown (7.5YR 6/4).   It is very gravelly loamy sand or extremely gravelly loamy sand.   Rounded chert pebbles, 2 mm to 3 inches in diameter range from 50 to 80 percent by volume and cobbles from 3 to 10 inches in diameter ranges from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe hardness of the Cr horizon ranges from chert conglomerate that can be crushed with moderate pressure of the hand to material that can barely be chipped with the spade.  Color of the fine particles in the slightly weathered conglomerate is reddish yellow (5YR 6/8), yellowish red (5YR 5/6), or reddish brown (5YR 5/4)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wewoka soils are on very gently sloping to moderately steep hills within the Northern Cross Timbers (MLRA 84A).  They occur on broad to narrow ridges.  Slopes are 1 to 20 percent.  These soils formed in material weathered from a chert conglomerate.  The climate is moist subhumid.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 64 degrees F. Average annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 38 inches.  Thornthwaite P-E index ranges from 58 to 62. Elevation is 900 to 1100 feet."
