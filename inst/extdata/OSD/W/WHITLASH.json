  "REVDATE": "04/2014",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitlash series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from fine grained igneous rocks and noncalcareous sandstone and siltstone. These soils are on eroded fan remnants, mountain slopes, hillslopes, escarpments, structural benches, ridges, lahars and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 4 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 450 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 5.5 degrees C.",
