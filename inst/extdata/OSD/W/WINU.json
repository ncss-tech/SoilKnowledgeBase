Bavdark, Dranburn, Odark, and Pontuge soils are very deep. Benteen soils have slightly alkaline layers in the lower profile. Brushtop soils are deep. Echemoor, Hoopgobel, and Stubbs soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 50 to 100 cm. Croydon soils have a paralithic contact at 100 to 150 cm. Clayburn, Crystalbutte, Davtone, Dehana, Demast, Dranyon, Hagenbarth, Millerlake and Thulepah have bedrock at a depth of more than 100 cm. Lostminer soils have a Bk horizon below the Bt horizons. Senchert and Squawval soils contain less than 15 percent rock fragments in the control section. Southmont soils are deep and very deep, average 24 to 32 percent clay and less than 20 percent rock fragments in the control section."

Elevations are 2200 to 2900 meters. The climate is cold, continental with cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 350 to 500 mm and the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C. The frost-free season is 45 to 70 days."
