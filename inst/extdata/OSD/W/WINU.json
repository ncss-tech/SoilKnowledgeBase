  "OVERVIEW": "The Winu series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from mixed volcanic rocks. Winu soils are on lower mountain side slopes. Slopes are 15 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 400 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
