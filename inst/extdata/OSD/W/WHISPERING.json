  "OVERVIEW": "The Whispering series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from basic igneous rocks.  Whispering soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 45 inches and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.   The mean annual soil temperature is 49 degrees to 54 degrees F.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from February to November and exceeds 47 degrees F from April to October.  The soil between depths of 7 to 21 inches is moist in all parts from December 15 through April 30, and is dry in all parts from July 1 through October 15.  The surface has 0 to 10 percent stones and boulders.  Mineralogy is dominated by amorphous materials.  The mineral is halloysite.  Coarse and very coarse sand is less than 10 percent throughout.  The base saturation varies from 50 to 75 percent and decreases with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon is 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4; or 5YR 5/4.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3 or 3/4.  Gravel content is 5 to 15 percent and cobble content is 0 to 10 percent.  It is neutral to moderately acid.  When dry values of 5 and moist values and chromas of 3 are present the epipedon is thin to qualify for a mollic epipedon.\nThe Bt horizon is 5YR 5/6, 6/4, or 6/6.  Moist color is 5YR 3/3, 3/4, or 4/4.  It is clay loam with very gravelly or very cobbly modifiers and has 27 to 35 percent clay.  Rock fragments consisting of gravel and cobbles commonly are 35 to 55 percent in the upper 20 inches.  It is slightly or medium acid."

Abegg soils have a solum of 29 to 60 inches thick and are 40 to 60 inches or more deep to bedrock.  Behemotosh soils have 18 to 20 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Collayomi soils lack a lithic or paralithic contact within 60 inches.  Marpa soils have a base saturation of 35 to 50 percent and lack obsidian or amorphous properties.  Skalan soils have only a thin mantle of ash and loess, are not dominated by halloysite, and have a C horizon above the bedrock."
