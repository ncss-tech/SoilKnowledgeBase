  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. HVG:LBW",
  "REVDATE": "09/2003",
  "STATES": "AR,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wabbaseka series consist of very deep, moderately well drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in clayey and loamy alluvium.  These level to nearly level soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 50 inches near the type location.",

Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  The A horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline and is noncalcareous.\nThe Bw1 horizon has hue of 5YR or 10YR, value of 3 and chroma of 2 or 3; or hue of 7.5YR,  value of 3 and chroma of 2.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  The Bw1 horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline and is noncalcareous.\nThe Bw2 horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4 or 6, or value of 5 and chroma of 4, 6, or 8. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.  The Bw1 horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline and is noncalcareous.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 and chroma of 4 or 6, or value of 5 or 6 and chroma of 4, 6, or 8.  Textures are silt loam, fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, loamy fine sand, or loamy sand.  Reaction range from slightly acid through moderately alkaline.  Horizons below 40 inches have bedding planes or have thin strata of finer textures."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wabbaseka soils are on level to nearly level alluvial plains of the Arkansas River.  The soils formed in clayey alluvium 12 to 20 inches thick overlying loamy alluvium.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils commonly occur on side slopes and ridge tops in a ridge-swale landscape.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 66 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 46 to 52 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  Wabbaseka soils are closely associated with the Latanier series, which often occurs on adjacent foot slopes and swales, in a ridge-swale complex, and the Desha, Coushatta, Roxana, and Oklared series.  Desha soils, which occur on adjacent broad flats are clayey throughout.  Coushatta, Roxana, and Oklared soils, which occur on adjacent natural levees, are loamy throughout and do not have mollic epipedons."
