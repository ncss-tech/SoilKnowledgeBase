  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetterdon series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sedimentary rock.  The Wetterdon soils are on alluvial fans and hillslopes.  Slopes are 0 to 16 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 21 to over 40 inches thick.  Depth to free carbonates is greater than 35 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 27 to 50 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F.  These soils  contain porcelanite chips.  Most are soft, weathered chips but there may be up to 10 percent lithic chips less than one-half inch across.  Colors may be variable depending upon the color of the baked shale parent material.  The moisture control section is dry for 60  consecutive days between July 15 and October 25.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or less commonly 5YR; value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  An AB or BA horizon is present in about half the pedons.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and less commonly 5YR; value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 1 through 4.  The 4 chroma occurs only below 23 inches.  Texture is silty clay loam, clay loam, silt loam, or loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 15 percent but less than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Individual horizons may exceed 35 percent clay but always occur too deep or when averaged have less than 35 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of this horizon.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.  Some pedons have a Btk horizon.\nSome pedons have a Bk horizon which has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, and 5YR; value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist; and chroma of 1 through 6.  Texture is silt loam, clay loam, or loam with 12 to 30 percent clay.  Secondary carbonates range from 3 to 8 percent.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline.\nThe C or BC horizon has the same color range as the Bk and lower Bt.  Textures are loam, clay loam, or silt loam with 14 to 30 percent clay.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline."

Albinas, Garrett, Sampson, and Woodly soils have more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  Haxtun soils have a sandy clay loam Bt horizon.  Jarita soils have a lithic contact at 30 to 40 inches. Prosper soils have a high watertable and are moderately well drained. Tracylee soils are non-calcareous throughout. Keya, Renner and Vosberg soils are not dry in the moisture control section for 60 consecutive days between July 15 and October 25.  Woonsocket soils have loamy sand or sand substrata above 40 inches."

The mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 19 inches of which about half falls as snow and less commonly rain in April, May, and early June.  The frost-free season is about 100 to 130 days."
