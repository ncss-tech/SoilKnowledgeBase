Kamaoa soils have strong structure in the A horizon and have a silty clay loam Bw horizon that is slightly to moderately plastic. Kapapala soils have an ashy coarse sand C horizon.  Kikoni soils have strong granular structure in the A horizon and strong subangular blocky structure in the 2Bw horizon. Kiolakaa soils are moderately deep (50 to 102 centimeters {20 to 40 inches}) to bedrock. Kula soils have silty clay loam texture in the 2B horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Waimea soils are on mid elevation, leeward slopes of Mauna Kea and Kohala volcanoes at elevations from 610 to 1830 meters (2000 to 6000 feet). These soils are on all hillslope positions of nearly level to moderately steep lava flows that are greater than 65,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 6 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over andesitic or basaltic lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1780 to 2030 millimeters (70 to 80 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 14 to 19 degrees C (57 to 66 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F). Strong winds are common and summers are droughty."
