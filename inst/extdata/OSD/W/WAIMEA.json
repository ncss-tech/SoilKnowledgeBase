  "OVERVIEW": "The Waimea series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from volcanic ash underlain by andesite and basalt.  Waimea soils are on ash fields and have slopes of 6 to 20 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 762 millimeters (30 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 degrees F).",

Kikoni soils have strong granular structure in the A horizon and strong subangular blocky structure in the 2Bw horizon.

These soils are on all hillslope positions of nearly level to moderately steep lava flows that are greater than 65,000 years old. Slope gradients range from 6 to 20 percent. The soils formed in basic volcanic ash over andesitic or basaltic lava. The mean annual rainfall ranges from 510 to 1270 millimeters (20 to 50 inches), with most of the rainfall occurring from October through April. The mean annual pan evaporation ranges from 1780 to 2030 millimeters (70 to 80 inches). The mean annual air temperature ranges from 14 to 19 degrees C (57 to 66 degrees F). The mean summer soil temperature and the mean winter soil temperature differ by less than 6 degrees C (11 degrees F). Strong winds are common and summers are droughty."
