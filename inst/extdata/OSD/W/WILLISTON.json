  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Williston series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in moderately thick beds of clayey marine sediments overlying soft limestone.  They are on nearly level to sloping upland landscapes in the Coastal Plain.  Water runs off the surface moderately rapidly.  Slope is dominantly less than 5 percent but ranges up to 8 percent on hillsides.",

Bushnell and Micanopy soils have mottles with chroma 2 or less within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  In addition, Bushnell soils have A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick, loamy texture, and siliceous mineralogy.  Pedro soils have loamy texture, siliceous mineralogy and shallow depth to limestone.  Zuber soils have a solum more than 60 inches deep."
