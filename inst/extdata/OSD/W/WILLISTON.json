Bushnell and Micanopy soils have mottles with chroma 2 or less within the upper 10 inches of the argillic horizon.  In addition, Bushnell soils have A horizons 20 to 40 inches thick, loamy texture, and siliceous mineralogy.  Pedro soils have loamy texture, siliceous mineralogy and shallow depth to limestone.  Zuber soils have a solum more than 60 inches deep."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Williston soils are on nearly level to sloping upland landscapes in the Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in moderately thick beds of clayey marine sediments overlying limestone.  Near the type location, rainfall averages about 55 inches annually with mean annual air temperature of more than 73 degrees F."
