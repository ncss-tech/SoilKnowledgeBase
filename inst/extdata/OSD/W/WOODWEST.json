    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 44 to 46 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 12 to 20 inches.  The soil moisture control section (11 inches to the Lithic contact) is dry from August 1 to November 1 (90 days) and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from May 1 to December 1 and exceeds 47 degrees F from June 1 to November 1.  Rock fragments on the surface range from 5 to 30 percent stones, 5 to 20 percent cobbles and 20 to 40 percent gravel.  The umbric epipedon ranges fro 10 to 14 inches thick.  Sodium fluoride pH ranges from 10.0 to 11.0.  Bulk density ranges from 0.7 to 0.9 g/cc.  15 bar water content of the fine earth fraction ranges from 15 to 20 percent.  Acid-oxalate-extractable aluminum plus one half acid-oxlate-extractable iron ranges from 3.5 to 2 throughout.  Base saturation by sum of cations ranges from 20 to 30 percent.  Base saturation by ammonium acetate ranges from 30 to 40 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4 or 4/4, 3/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/2, 3/2; 7.5YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is sandy loam modified by 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.\nThe Bw horizon is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6 or 5YR 4/4.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4 or 5YR 3/4.

The climate is subhumid with warm dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 to 40 inches with 60 to 100 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F and mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 60 to 80 days."
