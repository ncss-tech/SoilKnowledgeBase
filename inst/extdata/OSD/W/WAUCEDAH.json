  "STATUS": "Established Series",
  "BYREV": "Rev. LDL-WEF",
  "REVDATE": "10/2003",
  "STATES": "MI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Waucedah series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in loamy alluvial deposits. These soils are on flood plains adjacent to streams and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",

It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1, or is neutral with value of 2 or 3.  It is most commonly sandy loam, but the range includes fine sandy loam, loam and silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral. Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent in the series control section.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 2 to 5; and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is loam, silt loam , fine sandy loam or sandy loam.  Thin strata of gravelly sand, sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, clay loam or organic material are in the C horizon of some pedons.  The C horizon ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline. Some pedons have a clayey substratum."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Burnham, Nahma, Peacham, Sago, and Witbeck series.  Burnham and Peacham soils have a paralithic contact (Cd horizon) within 20 to 40 inches.. Nahma soils have limestone at depths of 20 to 40 inches.    Sago soils have a cambic horizon (Bg horizon).  Witbeck soils contain more than 5 percent coarse fragments in the soil."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Waucedah soils are on nearly level bottom lands of narrow streams in an area of Wisconsinan drift.  They flood at some time in most years.  Slope is 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in loamy, slightly acid to moderately alkaline alluvium.  The mean annual temperature ranges from about 41 to 44 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 33 inches."

Carbondale and Cathro soils are organic and typically are in bogs adjacent to Waucedah soils.  The well drained Emmet, Pemene, and Trenary soils and somewhat excessively drained Mancelona soils are on adjoining uplands."
