  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to contrasting material ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Rock fragments are mostly gravel and range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and 0 to 50 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Redox depletions with a chroma of 2 or less are above a depth of 24 inches.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weider soils are on nearly level floodplains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in loamy alluvium overlying sandy alluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 50 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from 105 to 160 days.  Elevation ranges from 90 to 1200 feet above mean sea level."

The  poorly drained sunny soils are in depressions and drainageways on the floodplain.  The well drained Waitsfield soils are in slightly higher positions on the floodplain."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1.  The classification is updated with this revision to Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, active, frigid Fluvaquentic Dystrudepts.  The former classification was Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Fluvaquentic Dystrochrepts.  2.  The Weider soils were previously included with  Podunk soils in Vermont.  3.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 25 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Fluvaquentic Dystrochrepts feature - base saturation (by ammonium acetate) is less than 60 percent in all subhorizons between the depths of 10 to 30 inches below the soil surface; and the organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth or remains more than 0.2 percent to a depth of 50 inches; and redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within 24 inches of the surface.\nd.  Strongly contrasting particle-size class - the transition between the coarse-loamy material and the underlying sandy or sandy-skeletal material is less than 5 inches thick.  The loamy material has less than 50 percent fine or coarse sand.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
