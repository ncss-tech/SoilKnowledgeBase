  "OVERVIEW": "The Weider series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium overlying sandy alluvium on floodplains.  Permeability is moderate in the loamy solum and rapid in the sandy substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches and mean annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.  Rock fragments are mostly gravel and range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and 0 to 50 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Redox depletions with a chroma of 2 or less are above a depth of 24 inches.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, sand, or coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1.  The classification is updated with this revision to Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, active, frigid Fluvaquentic Dystrudepts.  The former classification was Coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Fluvaquentic Dystrochrepts.  2.  The Weider soils were previously included with  Podunk soils in Vermont.  3.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 6 inches (Ap horizon).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 6 to 25 inches (Bw horizon).\nc.  Fluvaquentic Dystrochrepts feature - base saturation (by ammonium acetate) is less than 60 percent in all subhorizons between the depths of 10 to 30 inches below the soil surface; and the organic carbon content decreases irregularly with depth or remains more than 0.2 percent to a depth of 50 inches; and redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within 24 inches of the surface.\nd.  Strongly contrasting particle-size class - the transition between the coarse-loamy material and the underlying sandy or sandy-skeletal material is less than 5 inches thick.  The loamy material has less than 50 percent fine or coarse sand.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
