Alvey soils have hue of 10YR or yellower. Barx soils contain 2.5YR and 5YR hue. Cerrillos soils have a calcic horizon less than 20 inches deep. Clovis soils receive more than half of it annual precipitation between the months of July and October. Fernando soils contain 50 to 80 percent silt in the solum and are mapped in MLRA 51. Cabreros, Flaco, Horchata, Progresso, Sanostee, and Threetop soils are moderately deep over bedrock. Maysdorf soils contain less than 15 percent carbonates in the calcic horizon. Millett soils contain 25 to 75 percent gravel and cobbles in the lower part of the solum. Palabria soils are deep to sandstone. Selpats soils have skeletal lithologic discontinuity at depths ranging from 15 to 39 inches. Scholle soils contain 15 to 35 percent gravel in the control section. Solirec soils receive maximum precipitation in spring and fall. Cerrillos, Clovis, Millett and Scholle soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder in the B2t horizon. Fernando soils are deeper than 20 inches to the calcic horizon. Spenlo soils have a solum more than 40 inches thick and are noncalcareous to a depth of 35 to 44 inches. Tuweep soils are warmer and drier."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Wineg soils are at elevations of 4000 to 6000 feet on nearly level to strongly sloping alluvial fans and plains. The slopes range from 1 to 15 percent. The regolith consists of mixed alluvium dominantly from granite, basalt, schist and sandstone. The climate is semiarid. The average annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches, which occurs as thunderstorms in July, August and September, and as rain and snow during the winter months. The mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F. The average January temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the average July temperature is about 73 degrees F."

Lonti soils have fine-textured B2t horizons. Lynx soils do not have a calcic or a Bt horizon."
