  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodpass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from sandstone and limestone. These soils are on alluvial fans and uplands and have slopes of 2 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation is 11  inches.",

The surface layer is free of carbonates to a depth of 7 to 12 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F. These soils are dry in all parts 50 to 55 percent of the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is warmer than 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It commonly is loam or clay loam and less commonly silt loam and silty clay loam. It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dominant hue of 10YR, but ranges from 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It commonly is loam or clay loam and less commonly silt loam or silty clay loam. In some pedons there are stratified layers of loamy coarse sand below a depth of 40 inches. This horizon is moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous."
