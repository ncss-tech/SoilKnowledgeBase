    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 10 to 20 inches. The particle-size control section has 18 to 32 percent clay.  The surface layer is free of carbonates to a depth of 7 to 12 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 60 to 63 degrees F. These soils are dry in all parts 50 to 55 percent of the time that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is warmer than 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. It commonly is loam or clay loam and less commonly silt loam and silty clay loam. It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has dominant hue of 10YR, but ranges from 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 7 or 8 dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. It commonly is loam or clay loam and less commonly silt loam or silty clay loam. In some pedons there are stratified layers of loamy coarse sand below a depth of 40 inches. This horizon is moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous."

The soils formed in alluvial material derived mainly from sandstone and limestone. the climate is arid. The average annual precipitation is 10 to 12 inches, the mean annual temperature is 38 to 41 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 58 to 61 degrees F.  Freeze-free season is 55 to 75 days."
