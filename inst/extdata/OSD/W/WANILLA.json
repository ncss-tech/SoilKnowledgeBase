  "OVERVIEW": "The Wanilla series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained to moderately well drained soils that have moderately slow permeability.  These soils formed in loamy sediments on terraces in the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  They are nearly level to gently sloping soils with a seasonal high water table at a depth of 2.0 to 2.5 feet below the surface.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.",

The somewhat poorly drained Falkner soils, which have a fine-silty particle size class, are in similar positions as the Wanilla soils.  The poorly drained Guyton soils, which are dominantly gray throughout and have a fine-silty particle-size class, are in slightly lower positions on terraces and broad flats in uplands.  The moderately well drained Paden and Providence soils, which have a fragipan, mainly are on low ridges in higher parts of the landscape."
