    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness exceeds 60 inches.  The soil is very strongly acid to medium acid in all horizons except  surface layers that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4, or it is mottled in shades of brown, yellow or gray.  It is silt loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe E horizon, if present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 with few to many mottles with chroma of 2 or less; or it is mottled in shades of brown, gray, or yellow.  It is silt loam, sandy loam, or loam.\nThe B portion of the B/E horizon cosists of peds between tongues of albic material.  The upper part of the B/E horizon is mottled in shades of brown, gray, or yellow or it has a matrix in hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8, with few to many mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and gray.  It is sandy loam or loam.  The E part, which are tongues, pockets and streaks of albic material, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt, silt loam or sand.  The particle-size control section has 8 to 18 percent clay and 20 to 50 percent silt.  The B portion of the lower part of the B/E horizon is mottled in shades of gray and brown or yellow; or, it has a matrix in hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less, with few to many mottles in shades of brown or yellow.  It is silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  The E part has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less.  It is silt loam, loam, or silt.  The tongues, pockets and streaks of E material are 1 to 3 inches wide and extend through the B horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Closely related soils are the Duralde, Frizzell, Messer, and Tippo series.  The Duralde soils have a fine-silty control particle-size class and mixed mineralogy.  Frizzell, Messer, and Tippo soils have a coarse-silty particle size class; also, the Tippo soils have mixed mineralogy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wanilla soils are nearly level to gently sloping soils on terraces of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The regolith is marine or fluvial loamy sediments.  The climate is warm and humid near the type location; the mean annual temperature is about 66 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual precipitation is about 59 inches."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Falkner, Freestone, Guyton, Paden, and Providence soils.  The somewhat poorly drained Falkner soils, which have a fine-silty particle size class, are in similar positions as the Wanilla soils.  The poorly drained Guyton soils, which are dominantly gray throughout and have a fine-silty particle-size class, are in slightly lower positions on terraces and broad flats in uplands.  The moderately well drained Paden and Providence soils, which have a fragipan, mainly are on low ridges in higher parts of the landscape."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas of the Wanilla soils are used as pasture and forests.  Some areas are used for growing corn, soybeans, and small grains.  Forested areas are chiefly mixed hardwoods and pines.  Important commercial trees are cherrybark oak, loblolly pine, and sweetgum."
