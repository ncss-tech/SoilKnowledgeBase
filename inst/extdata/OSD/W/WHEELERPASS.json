  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wheelerpass series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium from quartzite. Wheelerpass soils are on back slopes of mountains. Slope ranges from 30 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
