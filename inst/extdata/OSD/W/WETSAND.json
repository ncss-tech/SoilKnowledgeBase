  "REVDATE": "09/2011",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetsand series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  These soils are on flood plains, flood-plain steps, stream terrace and drainageways. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
