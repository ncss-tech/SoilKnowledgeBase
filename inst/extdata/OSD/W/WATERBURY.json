At the higher elevations these soils are only on south-facing slopes. The soils formed in mixed colluvium weathered mainly from basic igneous (basalt) or tuff overlying basalt bedrock. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 304 to 406 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 7.2 to 10 degrees C. The mean July temperature is about 19.4 degrees C., and the mean January temperature is about -1.1 degrees C. The frost-free period is 80 to 140 days."

Ukiah and Prill soils are deeper than 50 centimeters to bedrock and have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section and are on broad plateaus."

Only Gwinly was mapped in Grant Co during the initial and update mapping.  Waterbury is no longer mapped in Grant Co.  As a result, the type location of Waterbury has been moved.  It is recommended that Waterbury eventually be made inactive and all Waterbury is correlated to Gwinly.\n________________________________________\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
