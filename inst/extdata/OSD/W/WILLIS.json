  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 54 degrees F. The soil is usually dry in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches for one-half to three-fourths of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. The depth to the duripan is 20 to 40 inches. In some pedons the pan grades into alternate layers of duripan and loess or is abruptly over basalt or Ringold sediments. The depth to calcium carbonate is 15 to 27 inches. The mollic epipedon is 7 to 18 inches thick. The particle-size control section has 10 to 15 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry. Texture is silt loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam. It has 0 to 5 percent fine gravel.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry. It has 0 to 5 percent fine gravel.  It has subangular blocky or coarse prismatic structure. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 to 8 dry and 3 to 6 moist and chroma of 1 to 4 moist or dry. It has 0 to 5 percent gravel and 0 to 3 percent cobbles.  Reaction is moderately or strongly alkaline. It is slightly to strongly effervescent and contains 1 to 10 percent calcium carbonate."

The soils formed in loess containing minor amounts of volcanic ash. The climate is semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  The average January temperature is 29 degrees F, average July temperature is 71 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F. The  frost-free season is 125 to 190 days."
