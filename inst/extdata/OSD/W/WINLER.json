  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedded shale ranges from about 20 to 40 inches.  The depth to accumulations of visible salt and gypsum ranges from about 8 to 17 inches.  The soil commonly does not have carbonates.  When the soil is dry, cracks 1/2 inch to 2 inches or more wide and several feet long extend downward through the solum.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It typically is clay, but in some pedons it is clay loam where the surface is influenced by loamy sediments or sorted.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bss horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It averages 60 to 75 percent clay.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bssyz horizon has color and texture of the Bss horizon.  The Bssyz horizon has common to many accumulations of gypsum and other salts.  Some pedons have carbonates, but have slight effervescence.\nThe C horizon has a color range similar to the Bss horizon.  It is clay and contains as much as 50 percent shale fragments by volume.  The C horizon ranges from moderately acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of l to 4.  Stains are common on fracture faces of shale fragments.  It ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Larvie, Metre, Wasa and Whitewater series. Larvie soils do not have visible salts near the surface.  In addition, Larvie soils have redder hue in the lower part of the profile.  Metre soils have a mollic epipedon.  Wasa soils have salts above depths of 8 inches and have a more dispersed surface.  Whitewater soils contain carbonates at the surface, do not have visible salts, and the bedrock has a high SAR."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winler soils are on nearly level to sloping hills, ridges and uplands.  Slopes are dominantly smooth and plane.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 15 percent.  Gilgai microrelief is in most areas.  The soil formed in clayey residuum weathered from clay shale.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 14 to 17 inches.  Growing season is about 130 to 150 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 11 to 14 inches; and growing degree days are about 2300 to 3600."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Wasa soils and the Hisle, Kyle, Lismas, Swanboy and Pierre soils.  Hisle soils have a natric horizon.  Kyle, Twotop and Swanboy soils do not have shale within depths of 40 inches.  In addition, Kyle soils do not have visible salts above 20 inches and have a stronger grade of and finer structure at the surface; and Swanboy soils have salts above depths of 8 inches and have a dispersed surface.  Lismas soils have shale within 20 inches.  Pierre soils do not have visible salts within a depth of 20 inches.  Hisle, Kyle, Pierre and Wasa soils are on similar landscapes as the Winler soils.  Swanboy and Twotop soils are on fans and flats below the Winler soils.  Lismas soils are on steeper slopes above the Winler soils."
