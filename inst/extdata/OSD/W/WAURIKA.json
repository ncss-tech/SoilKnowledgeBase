  "OVERVIEW": "The Waurika series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from old clayey alluvium or in residuum weathered from shale of Permian age, or a combination of these. These nearly level soils occur in slightly concave areas on paleoterraces in the Central Rolling Red Prairies (MLRA 80A). Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 15.5 degrees c (60 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 914 mm (36 in).",
