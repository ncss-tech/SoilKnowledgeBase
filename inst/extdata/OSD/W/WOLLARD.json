Barlow, Naptowne, and Timberly soils are more than 40 inches deep.  Getchell soils lack phyllite fragments and have rock fragments of mixed lithology in the control section.  Diobsud soils have greater than 6 percent organic carbon in the upper 10 cm of the spodic horizon.  Oso soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."

These soils formed in colluvium and slopes alluvium from volcanic ash, glacial till dominated by phyllite and phyllite overlying glacial till dominated by phyllite.  The average annual precipitation is 75 to 85 inches.  The mean January temperature is 31 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 58 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 41 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 90 to 120 days."

This draft reflects a change in classification from fine-loamy, mixed Typic Cryorthods to medial Alic Haplocryods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 4 inches, a cambic horizon from 4 to 11 inches, andic soil properties from 0 to 35 inches, and a paralithic contact with dense glacial till at 35 inches.\nFails criteria for a spodic horizon because of hue.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
