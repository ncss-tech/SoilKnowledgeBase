  "OVERVIEW": "The Wollard series consists of moderately deep, moderately well drained soils formed in glacial till dominated by phyllite and phyllite overlying glacial till dominated by phyllite, colluvium, and slope alluvium from volcanic ash.  Wollard soils are on glacially modified mountain sides and have slopes of 3 to 65 percent.  The average annual temperature is 42 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches.",

This draft reflects a change in classification from fine-loamy, mixed Typic Cryorthods to medial Alic Haplocryods.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are an albic horizon from the mineral surface to 4 inches, a cambic horizon from 4 to 11 inches, andic soil properties from 0 to 35 inches, and a paralithic contact with dense glacial till at 35 inches.\nFails criteria for a spodic horizon because of hue."
