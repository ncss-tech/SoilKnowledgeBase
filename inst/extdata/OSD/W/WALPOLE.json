  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to sand or loamy sand substratum layers range from 46 to 71 cm.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 25 percent by volume in the solum and from 0 to 50 percent in individual layers of the substratum.  Typically, 70 percent or more of the rock fragments are rounded gravel.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Disturbed pedons have a Ap horizon 5 to 10 inches thick with value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Dry value is 6 or more.  The A or Ap horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It commonly has weak or moderate granular structure but the range includes subanular blocky in some pdons and is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have an Eg horizon with hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture and structure are similar to the A horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Chroma of 3 or 4 is limited to subhorizons and chroma of 1 or 2 is in some subhorizon within a depth of 20 inches. The horizon has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  Fine-earth texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam with more than 50 percent fine or coarser sand.  Structure is weak granular or weak subangular blocky, or the horizon is massive.  Consistence is friable or very friable.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  The horizon has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features.  Texture is similar to the B horizon.  Structure is weak subangular blocky or the horizon is massive.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture of individual layers ranges from loamy fine sand to coarse sand in the fine-earth fraction."

Busti, Lamson, Leicester, Massena, Neversink, Newstead, Punsit, Red Hook, Ridgebury, Stissing, and Sun soils are coarse-loamy.  Norwell, Ridgebury and Stissing soils have a dense substratum.  Fredon and Raypol soils are coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Moosilauke soils are frigid. Scarboro soils have a histic epipedon.  Stafford and Wareham soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Sudbury soils have matrix chroma of 3 or more in the B horizon to a depth of 50 cm."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Walpole soils are nearly level and gently sloping soils in shallow drainageways and low-lying areas on terraces and plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 8 percent.  The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial and stratified drift materials derived mainly from crystalline rocks.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C., mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1270 mm, and the growing season ranges from 120 to 190 days."

The excessively drained Hinckley, somewhat excessively drained Merrimac, and the moderately well drained Sudbury soils are common drainage associates. Agawam, Branford, Enfield, Haven, Ninigret, and Tisbury soils are better drained terrace associates that are loamy over stratified sand and gravel.  The well drained Canton and Charlton soils and the somewhat excessively drained Gloucester soils are on nearby till uplands.  Deerfield, Hartford, Manchester, and Windsor soils are coarse-textured soils on nearby glaciofluvial landforms.  Occum, Pootatuck, and Rippowam soils are on flood plains."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY:  Poorly drained.  Surface runoff is slow. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high in the surface layer and subsoil, and high or very high in the substratum. Walpole soils have a water table at or near the surface much of the year."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are wooded.  Cleared areas are used for hay and pasture.  Drained areas are used for silage corn and hay.  hemlockThe typical vegetation consists of a forested community with canopy trees of Red Maple, American Elm, and/or scattered black gum, swamp white oak and yellow birch and/or eastern hemlock; with an shrub understory of spicebush, silky dogwood, northern arrow-wood with sweet pepperbush, and winterberry in slightly wetter situations; and a herb layer of cinnamon fern, royal fern, false hellebore, violets, wood-reed grass, with skunk cabbage and sedges."

Walpole series has been correlated in some published surveys in Maine, but after conducting temperature studies, Maine currently includes only frigid and cryic  soil temperature regimes.  The series is of moderate extent."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 18 cm (Oe and A horizons).\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 18 to 63 cm (Bg and BC horizons).\n3. Aquic moisture regime - indicated by chroma of 2 in Bg horizon but with chroma too high within 76 cm (chroma of 4 in BC horizon) to qualify for Typic Endoaquepts.\n4. Endoaquepts subgroup based on saturation to a depth of 200 cm from the mineral soil surface.\n5. Aeric great group based on matrix color and chroma of 3 or more in one subhorizon between the Ap and 75 cm. (BC horizon).\n6. Particle-size class - averages sandy in the control section from 25 to 102 cm does not meet contrasting criteria.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
