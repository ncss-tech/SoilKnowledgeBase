  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitepine series consists of very deep, well drained soils that have a high component of volcanic ash in the surface layers and formed in glaciolacustrine deposits. These soils are on lake plains and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
