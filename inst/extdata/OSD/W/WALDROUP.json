  "OVERVIEW": "The Waldroup series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed from basaltic cinders and ash. Waldroup soils are on cinder cones, cinder beds and basalt flows. Slopes are dominantly 10 to 25 percent but range to 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
