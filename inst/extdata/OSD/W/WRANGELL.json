  "STATES": "AK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wrangell series consists of very poorly drained soils formed in organic materials overlying clayey lacustrine sediments.  Permafrost is present at 14 to 38 inches below the organic soil surface.  Wrangell soils are in depressional areas on broad lacustrine terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 26 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is less than 32 degrees F.  The mat of organic material consists of fibrous over partially decomposed moss, sedge and ericaceous shrub fibers 18 to 33 inches thick.  Depth to permafrost ranges from 14 to 38 inches below the surface two months after the summer solstice.  Saturated conditions typically occur within 8 inches of the surface.  Mineral soil textures in the lower part of the control section include clay,silty clay  clay loam and silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 35 to 70 percent.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral in the organic horizons and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the underlying mineral horizons.\nThe O horizons have moist hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; moist value of 2 or 2.5; and moist chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe C horizons have moist hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, 5GY, or 5G; moist value from 3 to 5; and moist chroma from 1 to 3.  Textures include clay, silty clay, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Coarse fragment content ranges from 0 to 20 percent gravel and cobble."
