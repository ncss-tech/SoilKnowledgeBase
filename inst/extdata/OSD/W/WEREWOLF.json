Ashmed soils have 20 to 35 percent clay with an SAR of 13 to 35 in the argillic horizon. Bitter soils also average more than 18 percent clay in the argillic horizon and are dry in the moisture control section from July to September. Blind, Bluebird, Soledad and Topawa soils receive average precipitation of more than 200 millimeters. In addition, Blind and Bluebird soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section, and Topawa soils have hues of 5YR and 2.5 YR throughout the Bt horizons. Highland and Tiefort soils have lithic contacts at 75 to 100 centimeters (30 to 40 inches) and 50 to 75 centimeters (20 to 30 inches), respectively, and average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Khyber and Nellake soils are between 8 and 25 centimeters (3 to 10 inches) and 5 to 20 centimeters (2 to 8 inches), respectively, to the top of an argillic horizon. In addition, Khyber soils average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control. Timosea soils also average more than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Twobitter soils have visible gypsum in the argillic horizon and a higher calcium carbonate equivalent through the particle size control section and below.

Arizo soils are on adjacent drainageways and fan aprons and are sandy-skeletal throughout the profile and do not have argillic horizons. Gocougs and Pinkcan soils are on similar landscape positions. Both soils have an argillic horizon with a fine-loamy particle-size control section, but Gocougs are moderately deep to a petrocalcic and Pinkcan soils have a duripan between 100 and 150 centimeters."
