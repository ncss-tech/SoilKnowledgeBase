However, Wawasee soils actually have a bulk density range of less than 1.70 g/cc, not more than. All other properties overlap. During future MLRA update activities, series differentiae will need to be more clearly defined for these series. At present, Caprell series occurs in MLRA 95B and commonly (not required) have a loess cap and Wawasee series occurs in MLRAs 98 and 111C and do not have loess on the surface.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Purdue University Characterization data available No. FU7902\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
