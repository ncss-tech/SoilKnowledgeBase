Delnorte soils are located in MLRA 42 and have dominant hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, and chroma of 3 or less and formed in deep alluvial material weathered from granite and other igneous rocks.  Delthorny soils have hardpans as shallow as 6 inches.  Splotter soils are located in MLRA 42 and do not have 5YR hue.  Yurm soils do not include 5YR or 7.5YR hue."

Soils in Arizona should be re-evaluated for soil temperature below 2,500 feet from cool thermic (59 to 63 degrees F.) to warm thermic (64 to 71 degrees F.) or hyperthermic. Slopes dominantly are 1 to 10 percent and range from 1 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous residuum weathered from basalt, limestone, and eolian sands.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches.  Frost-free period is about 180 to 280 days."
