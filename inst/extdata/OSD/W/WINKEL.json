  "OVERVIEW": "The Winkel series are shallow to a petrocalcic horizon, well drained formed in calcareous residuum weathered from basalt, limestone, and eolian sands. Winkel soils are on mesa tops, plateaus and mountain slopes. Slope ranges from 1 to 30 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 59 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches.",

Soils in Arizona should be re-evaluated for soil temperature below 2,500 feet from cool thermic (59 to 63 degrees F.) to warm thermic (64 to 71 degrees F.) or hyperthermic. Slopes dominantly are 1 to 10 percent and range from 1 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous residuum weathered from basalt, limestone, and eolian sands.  The mean annual air temperature is 57 to 70 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 80 to 84 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 12 inches.  Frost-free period is about 180 to 280 days."
