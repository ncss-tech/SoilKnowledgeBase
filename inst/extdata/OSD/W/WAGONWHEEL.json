  "OVERVIEW": "The Wagonwheel series consists of very deep, well drained soils on gently sloping to rolling uplands and plains. Slopes are 2 to 16 percent.  These soils formed in wind reworked silty material. The average annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches, average annual air temperature is 49 degrees F., and the average frost free season is 129 to 158 days.",

Since, over the past 90 years erosional processes and deep tillage cultural practices, the minimal mollic epipedon was destroyed or mixed with calcareous subsoils the soil has been altered in physical characteristics, thusly changing series."
