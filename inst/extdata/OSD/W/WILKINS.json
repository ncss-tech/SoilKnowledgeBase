    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist but dry for 45 to 80 consecutive days during the summer months between depths of 4 and 12 inches in most years. The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more. Depth to the argillic horizon is 15 to 30 inches. Black and red concretions 0.5 to 3 mm in size are few to common in the E and 2Bt horizons.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 0 to 1 in the upper part and 1 to 3 in the lower part. It has faint to distinct redox concentrations below depth of 4 inches. This horizon is silt loam and has 18 to 27 percent clay. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has value of 4 to 6 moist, 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist in more than half of the matrix and is 4 to 10 inches thick. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. It is silt loam with 10 to 27 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6 moist, 4 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist or dry. It is silty clay or clay and has 40 to 60 percent clay. This horizon has lenses of volcanic ash below 40 inches in some pedons. It has 0 to 10 percent gravel mostly in the lower part. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nA BC horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR, value of 3 to 6 moist, 4 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry. It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with 15 to 40 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent gravel."

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cowsly and Morphey series. Morphey soils are well or moderately well drained, lack redox features and have a calcic horizon at a depth of 20 to 30 inches. Cowsly soils are moderately well drained, have redox concentrations within a depth of 20 to 40 inches and have secondary carbonates below 40 inches in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Wilkins soils are in drainageways, swales, and concave drainage basins on plateaus and in mountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. Elevations are typically 2,800 to 5,500 feet but range down to 1,100 feet in northeastern Idaho. The soils formed in loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash over alluvium weathered from basic igneous rocks. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 35 inches. The average January temperature is 23 to 25 degrees F; average summer temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 125 days."

Akerite soils are on adjacent footslopes, moderately well drained, and have a volcanic ash mantle. Klicker soils are on adjacent south-facing side slopes, well drained, loamy-skeletal and 20 to 40 inches deep to basalt. Tolo soils are on adjacent footslopes and side slopes, well drained and have a volcanic ash mantle."
