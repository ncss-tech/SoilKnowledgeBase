  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilkins series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash over alluvium weathered from basic igneous rocks. Wilkins soils are in concave basins and swales on plateaus and in mountain valleys. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

The soils formed in loess and minor amounts of volcanic ash over alluvium weathered from basic igneous rocks. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 17 to 35 inches. The average January temperature is 23 to 25 degrees F; average summer temperature is 61 to 65 degrees F. The mean annual temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 50 to 125 days."
