  "OVERVIEW": "The Worthenton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and interbedded siltstone.  They are on flood plains and depressed positions within meander belts. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

The Bremer, Chancellor, Crossplain, Gregory, Lodgepole  and Mazaska soils have reactions of pH 4.5 through pH 7.8 in the Bt horizon.  The Bremer, Edinburg, Gregory, Haig, Lodgepole, Taintor, Virden, and Winterset soils do not have free carbonates above 100 cm.  The Minnetonka soils contain more carbonates and formed in lacustrine deposits.  The Worthing soils are nonflooded and have mollic epipedons more than 90 cm thick."
