  "OVERVIEW": "The Worthenton series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from shale and interbedded siltstone.  They are on flood plains and depressed positions within meander belts. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to the base of the argillic and top of the horizon of maximum carbonate accumulation ranges from 13 to 24 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  These soils are flooded for brief durations during May through July.  Depth to endosaturation is 0.5 to 3 feet.  Lignite chips are common throughout the soil in most horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or  3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Redoximorphic features are present in most pedons.  There is typically an organic mat of partially decomposed material on the surface.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is clay, silty clay, or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe Bkg horizon has hue of 10YR through 5GY, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 or 4 moist or N 4/ moist, and chroma of 0 through 4.  It is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  Clay ranges from 30 to 50 percent.   Carbonates range from 10 to 20 percent and average less than 15 percent.  It is moderately alkaline in the upper part and is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline in the lower part.  EC ranges from 2 to 8 mmhos below 36 inches."

The Bremer, Chancellor, Crossplain, Gregory, Lodgepole  and Mazaska soils have reactions of pH 4.5 through pH 7.8 in the Bt horizon.  The Bremer, Edinburg, Gregory, Haig, Lodgepole, Taintor, Virden, and Winterset soils do not have free carbonates above 40 inches.  The Minnetonka soils contain more carbonates and formed in lacustrine deposits.  The Worthing soils are nonflooded and have mollic epipedons more than 36 inches thick."

Elevations are 3,500 to 4,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches, but this soil received additional water during brief flooding in May, June, and July.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 44 to 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 120 days."

Draknab and Haverdad soils have ochric epipedons, less clay in the control section, and no developed Bt horizon.  Havertel soils have less clay in the control section and no developed Bt horizon.   All these soils typically occur on the first or second terrace position above the stream or river channel."
