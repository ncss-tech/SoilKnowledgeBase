  "OVERVIEW": "The Winship series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty alluvial deposits and lacustrine sediments on glacial lake plains.  Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and moderately slow or slow in the substratum.  These soils are in shallow depressions and flat drainageways and slopes are less than 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Harmony soils are fine-textured and are moderately well drained.  Hidewood soils do not have an argillic horizon and have carbonates above a depth of 40 inches.  Parnell and Tonka soils are fine textured and are more poorly drained."

The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches. & GEOGRAPHIC SETTING SOILS:  They are the competing Harmony and Tonka soils, and the Aberdeen, Bearden, Beotia, and Great Bend soils.  Tonka soils are in closed depressions.  The Aberdeen and Harmony soils are on broad smooth flats on nearby landscapes.  Aberdeen soils have a natric horizon.  Bearden soils have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches, and are on slightly convex slopes along depressions and drainageways.  Beotia and Great Bend soils are better drained and are on higher positions on adjacent landscapes."
