    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 32 to more than 60 inches.  The depth to free carbonate ranges from 40 to 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It typically is silt loam, but is silty clay loam in some pedons.  It ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It typically has light gray (10YR 6/1) coatings on the surface of peds.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam and averages 27 to 35 percent clay.  It typically has light gray (10YR 6/1) coatings on the surface of peds in the upper part.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nA BC or Bk horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Redox concentrations range from common to many, fine to medium, faint to distinct.  It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Loamy glacial till is below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons.  Some pedons have varves below a depth of 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barfus series in the same family and the Harmony, Hidewood, Parnell, and Tonka series.  Barfus soils have carbonates throughout and are well drained.  Harmony soils are fine-textured and are moderately well drained.  Hidewood soils do not have an argillic horizon and have carbonates above a depth of 40 inches.  Parnell and Tonka soils are fine textured and are more poorly drained.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winship soils are in shallow depressions and flat drainageways in glacial lake plains.  Slope gradients generally are less than 1 percent but do go up to 2 percent.  The soils formed in silty alluvial deposits and glaciolacustrine sediments.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 16 to 24 inches.\nGEOGRAPHIC SETTING SOILS:  They are the competing Harmony and Tonka soils, and the Aberdeen, Bearden, Beotia, and Great Bend soils.  Tonka soils are in closed depressions.  The Aberdeen and Harmony soils are on broad smooth flats on nearby landscapes.  Aberdeen soils have a natric horizon.  Bearden soils have a calcic horizon within a depth of 16 inches, and are on slightly convex slopes along depressions and drainageways.  Beotia and Great Bend soils are better drained and are on higher positions on adjacent landscapes.\nDRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Surface runoff is negligible to low and ponded in the depressional phase.  During the growing season, the water table is 2 feet to 4 feet in the spring and early summer.  In years of excess rainfall or snowmelt, some areas of these soils are temporarily ponded. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and moderately slow to slow in the substratum.\nUSE AND VEGETATION:  Soils are cropped to corn, small grains, sunflowers, and alfalfa.  Native vegetation is big bluestem, switchgrass, little bluestem, needlegrass, and sedges.\nDISTRIBUTION AND EXTENT:  Northeastern South Dakota.  These soils are of small extent.\nMLRA SOIL SURVEY REGIONAL OFFICE (MO) RESPONSIBLE:  St. Paul, Minnesota\nSERIES ESTABLISHED:  Brown County, South Dakota, 1987.\nREMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of about 40 inches (Ap, A, BA, Bt1 horizons); argillic horizon - the zone from about 33 to 48 inches (Bt1, Bt2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  NSSL Sample Nos. 83P46-51.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
