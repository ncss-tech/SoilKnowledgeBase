  "OVERVIEW": "The Woolstalf series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from metasedimentary rocks.  Woolstalf soils are on mountain slopes and ridges and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 25 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",
