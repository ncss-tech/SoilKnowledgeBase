  "OVERVIEW": "The Woolsey series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and lacustrine sediments derived from mixed rocks.  Woolsey soils are on fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
