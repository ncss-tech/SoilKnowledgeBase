Chacoan soils are moderately deep to sandstone bedrock. Delp soils are loamy fine sand, or sand below the argillic horizon.  Enos soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 50 to 100 cm. Glotrain soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative from July through September due to summer convection storms.  Mayqueen soils are noncalcareous.  Shiprock and Wallson soils have noncalcareous A and Bt horizons, and contain less than l5 percent rock fragments in the argillic horizon."

Slopes are 2 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,190 to 1,280 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 110 to 150 mm; mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free season is l00 to l30 days."
