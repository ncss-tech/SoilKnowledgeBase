  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilbur series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in silty alluvium. These soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (56 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches).",

Permeability is moderate. The potential for surface water runoff is negligible or very low. Depth to an intermittent apparent water table is at a depth of 0.5 to 0.6 meters (1.5 to 2 feet) from December through April in most years. These soils are subject to rare to frequent periods of flooding."
