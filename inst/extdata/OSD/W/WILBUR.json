The Wilbur soils formed in silty alluvium deposited mainly from loess-covered hills and loess-covered till plains. Mean annual temperature ranges from about 10 to 14 degrees C (50 to 57 degrees F), mean annual precipitation from about 889 to 1168 mm (35 to 46 inches), frost free period ranges from 150 to 210 days and elevation ranges from 104 to 290 meters (340 to 950 feet) above mean sea level."

The somewhat poorly drained Wakeland soils are typically on lower lying flood-plain steps. The well drained Haymond soils are typically on higher lying flood-plain steps and on natural levees."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Moderately well drained. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s). Permeability is moderate. The potential for surface water runoff is negligible or very low. Depth to an intermittent apparent water table is at a depth of 0.5 to 0.6 meters (1.5 to 2 feet) from December through April in most years. These soils are subject to rare to frequent periods of flooding."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn and soybeans. Some of the narrow flood plains are used for forest or pasture. The native vegetation is deciduous forest, chiefly of beech, elm, hickory, hackberry, buckeye, sugar maple, oak, and sycamore."
