  "OVERVIEW": "The Wynoose series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils on till plains. They formed in loess and the underlying pedisediment overlying a Sangamon age paleosol. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 millimeters (42 inches).",
