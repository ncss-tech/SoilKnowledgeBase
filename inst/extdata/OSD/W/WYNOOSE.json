Leaksville soils have a paralithic and lithic contact, both within 60 inches. Pierron and Rushville average less 15 percent sand throughout the series control section. Watchung soils formed in residuum, have rock fragments throughout the particle size control section, and are in a cool mesic temperature regime. Zwingle soils average more than 42 percent clay in the particle size control section and are in a cool mesic temperature regime."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wynoose soils are on broad areas of till plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. Wynoose soils formed in 30 to 55 inches of loess and the underlying silty or loamy pedisediment or coarser loess (Roxana silts). They are underlain by a Sangamon age paleosol formed in diamicton or accretion gley. The paleosol may or may not have been truncated by erosion prior to loess deposition. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 46 inches, frost free days range from 180 to 200, and elevation ranges from 350 to 700 feet above sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Ava, Blair, Bluford, Hickory, Passport, and Racoon soils. The moderately well drained Ava and Bluford soils are in a drainage sequence with Wynoose soils. They all have brittleness in the subsoil and are on ridges and knolls higher on the landform. The somewhat poorly drained Blair and Passport soils formed primarily in silty or loamy pedisediment, respectively, and are on back slopes or near the heads of drainageways below Wynoose soils. The well drained Hickory soils formed in diamicton on back slopes below Wynoose soils. Racoon soils are on foot slopes or on the stream terraces below the Wynoose soils."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Poorly drained. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Periods of brief ponding can occur after heavy rains, generally during the period from January through May.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low to moderately high 0.01 to 1.41 micrometer per second). Permeability is slow or very slow  If un-drained, these soils have a water table within 15 cm (0.5 foot) of the surface between November and June in most years. Where drained,\nthe water table is within 31 cm (1 foot) of the surface between January and May in most years."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 20 inches (Ap and Eg horizon);\nalbic horizon - the zone from 7 to 20 inches (Eg horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 20 to 88 inches (Btg1, Btg2, 2Btg3, 2Btg4, and 3Btgb horizons);\nabrupt textural change from the Eg2 to the Btg1 horizon;\naquic conditions - chroma of 2 and redox concentrations between a depth of 16 and 20 inches and in the upper 5 inches of the argillic horizon; a positive reaction to alpha-alpha dipyridyl is assumed.\nWith this update (8/2003), a new typical pedon is selected. Data from the former OSD site in Effingham County indicated that the pedon did not represent the Wynoose series because it did not have an abrupt textural change.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Data for several pedons of Wynoose soils are on file at the Illinois State Office.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
