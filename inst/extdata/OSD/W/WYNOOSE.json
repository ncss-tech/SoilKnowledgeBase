  "OVERVIEW": "The Wynoose series consists of very deep, slowly or very slowly permeable, poorly drained soils on broad till plains. They formed in loess, the underlying silty or loamy pedisediment or coarser loess (locally known as Roxana silts), and underlying Sangamon age paleosol. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 1067 mm (42 inches).",

Wynoose soils formed in 30 to 55 inches of loess and the underlying silty or loamy pedisediment or coarser loess (Roxana silts). They are underlain by a Sangamon age paleosol formed in diamicton or accretion gley. The paleosol may or may not have been truncated by erosion prior to loess deposition. The mean annual air temperature ranges from 53 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 46 inches, frost free days range from 180 to 200, and elevation ranges from 350 to 700 feet above sea level."

The moderately well drained Ava and Bluford soils are in a drainage sequence with Wynoose soils. They all have brittleness in the subsoil and are on ridges and knolls higher on the landform. The somewhat poorly drained Blair and Passport soils formed primarily in silty or loamy pedisediment, respectively, and are on back slopes or near the heads of drainageways below Wynoose soils. The well drained Hickory soils formed in diamicton on back slopes below Wynoose soils. Racoon soils are on foot slopes or on the stream terraces below the Wynoose soils."

Permeability is slow or very slow  If un-drained, these soils have a water table within 15 cm (0.5 foot) of the surface between November and June in most years.
