  "OVERVIEW": "The Wagonbow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from volcanics on hills and mountains.  Slopes range from 15 to 25 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
