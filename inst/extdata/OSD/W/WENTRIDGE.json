  "OVERVIEW": "The Wentridge series consists of moderate deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from sandstone.  Wentridge soils are on hills.  Slopes range from 50 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
