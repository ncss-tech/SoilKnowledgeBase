The soil from a depth of 7 inches to the paralithic contact is moist in all parts from November 1 to May 1 and is dry in all parts from June 1 to October 15 in most years.  It is loam throughout with 12 to 27 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel. Base saturation ranges from 60 to 85 percent.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 6/4.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/4, 5/3 or 7/3.  There is a slight increase in clay content over the A horizon, but it is not enough to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid."

Amador soils are formed from rhyolitic tuffaceous sediments, are influenced by ash, and have a mean annual soil temperature that ranges from 64 to 67 degrees F.  The Osito soil is dry for greater than 175 days and has mean annual soil temperatures that range from 59 to 70 degrees F. and have neutral to mildly alkaline reaction in the subsoil."

The climate is characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation varies from 45 to 60 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 44 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is about 72 degrees F.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon -- the zone from 0 to 3 inches (A)\nCambic Horizon --  the zone from 3 to 15 inches (Bw1, Bw2)\nParalithic contact -- the boundary at 15 inches (Cr)\nThe description of the competing Osito soils states that the soil is usually dry in the SMCS for greater than 45 consecutive days within the 4 months that follow the summer solstice.  This range was narrowed using precipitation data from soil moisture probability sheets (Newhall, 1976) for stations near the Osito type location (Pasadena, Pomona).  MAP for Pasadena is 18 in., for Pomona 16 in., and for Osito MAP is 17 inches. Using monthly precipitation amounts it was calculated that the Osito soils will be dry in all parts greater than 175 days.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
