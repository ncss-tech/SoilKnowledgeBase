    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from 50 to more than 80 inches.  Soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral in the A and AE horizons and very strongly acid to slightly acid in the E, BE, Btg, and Cg horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  Coarse fragments, mainly ironstone nodules, quartz gravel or weathered phosphatic limestone fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume.\nThe AE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4, and chroma of 1 to 4, or value of 5 and chroma of 3.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand or their gravelly analogs.  Coarse fragments, mainly ironstone nodules, quartz gravel or weathered phosphatic limestone fragments range from 0 to 15 percent by volume.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 6; with or without mottles or redox features in shades of yellow or brown.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or their gravelly analogs.  Coarse fragments, mainly ironstone nodules, quartz gravel, or weathered phosphatic limestone fragments range from 2 to 30 percent by volume.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has colors similar to that of the E horizon.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or their gravelly analogs.  Content and composition of coarse fragments is similar to that of the E horizon.\nThe upper part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, and chroma of 0 to 4, with few to common redox features in varying shades of gray, yellow, or brown.  Few to common, fine and medium mottles in shades of red may be present in some pedons.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or their gravelly analogs.  Coarse fragments, mainly ironstone nodules, quartz gravel, or weathered phosphatic limestone fragments range from 2 to 30 percent by volume.\nThe lower part of the Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 5 to 8, chroma of 0 to 2, with or without redox features in varying shades of gray, yellow, or brown.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or sandy clay with less than 10 percent by volume coarse fragments.\nThe Cg horizon is variable in colors similar to the lower part of the Btg horizon.  Textures range from loamy sand to clay."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  Moriah is the only series in the same family.  Similar series include Bonneau, Elloree, Goldhead, Leefield, and Ocilla.   Moriah soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 40 to 72 inches.  Bonneau, Leefield, and Ocilla soils are Ultisols.  In addition, Bonneau soils are moderately well drained and Leefield soils have horizons which contain 5 to 20 percent plinthite ranging from 30 to 60 inches deep.  Elloree and Goldhead soils are poorly drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wampee soils are on nearly level to moderately steep areas on low uplands, adjacent to drainageways and flood plains.  They formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  The mean annual temperature is about 60 to 70 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 50 to 60 inches."

Albany and Plummer soils have an argillic horizon at depths of 40 inches or more.  Pelham and Plummer soils are poorly drained.  Also, Albany, Pelham, and Plummer soils have a base saturation less than 35 percent throughout."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  Runoff is slow.  Permeability is moderately rapid to rapid in the surface and subsurface layers, moderate in the upper part of the subsoil, moderately slow in the lower part of the subsoil, and variable in the substratum.  A water table is within a depth of 12 to 36 inches of the surface for 2 to 6 months, from late summer to spring, or for short periods after heavy rainfall.  In areas of short, steep slopes, wetness occurs as the result of lateral seepage."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Tame pasture and commercial pine tree production.  Forested areas are mixed hardwood and pine, including slash and loblolly pine, sweetgum, red maple, American holly, laurel oak, southern magnolia, and hickory.  Cypress occurs in areas of seeps at the head of drainage ways.  The understory includes waxmyrtle, dwarf palmetto, American beautyberry, greenbriar, Virginia creeper, wild grape, pineland threeawn, low panicum, and various other grasses."
