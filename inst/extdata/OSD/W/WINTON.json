  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the A, E, and B horizons and from 0 to 15 percent in the C horizon.  Soil reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.  Flakes of mica range from few to common in the B and C horizons of most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within 24 inches of the upper boundary of the Bt horizon, but below a depth of 20 inches from the surface.  Soft masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, yellow, or red are in subhorizons of the Bt horizon of many pedons.  Subhorizons of the Bt may lack a matrix color and have a pattern of colors in shades of yellow, brown, gray, or red.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam.\nA Btg horizon is present in some pedons.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown or red are typically present.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Bt.  The BCg horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Btg horizon.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8 and may be multicolored, or have iron accumulations or depletions in shades of yellow, brown, gray, or red.  Some pedons have a Cg horizon that is similar in color to the BCg horizon.  In each pedon, some part of the C horizon within a depth of 80 inches is not periodically saturated and lacks redoximorphic features.  Texture is sand to clay and is commonly stratified."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abell, Altavista, Bertie, and Tetotum series in the same family.  Abell soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the Bt horizon.  Altavista soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces.  In addition, they have a fluctuating ground water table.  Bertie soils are on broad level areas of the lower Coastal Plain and have significant amounts of montmorillonite in the clay fraction.  Tetotum soils have more than 30 percent silt or 40 percent silt plus very fine sand in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winton soils are on long narrow bluffs that break sharply into rivers and their major tributaries that drain from the Piedmont and Coastal Plain.  Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in fluvial and marine sediments of mixed mineralogy origin.   Mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F near the type location."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  In addition to the competing Altavista series these are the Craven, Goldsboro, Gritney, Lynchburg, Norfolk, State, and Wickham series.  Craven and Gritney soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Goldsboro, Lynchburg, Noboco, and Norfolk soils have siliceous mineralogy.  State and Wickham soils are well drained.  All of these soils except Gritney are on gentler slopes."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Moderately well drained; medium to very rapid runoff; moderate to moderately slow permeability in the subsoil.  These soils have a perched water table due to seepage down strongly sloping to very steep side slopes."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Almost all of this soil is in forests of mixed hardwoods with some pine.  Common trees are southern red oak, white oak, sweetgum, water oak, American beech, sweetgum,  red maple, and loblolly pinej.  Understory plants include sourwood, American holly, flowering dogwood, red maple, blueberry, and greenbrier."
