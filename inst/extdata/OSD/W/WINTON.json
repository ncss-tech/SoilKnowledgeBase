  "STATES": "NC,VA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Winton series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that are on sloping to very steep bluffs along rivers that flow through the Coastal Plain.  They formed in fluvial and marine sediments of mixed mineralogy origin.  Permeability in the subsoil is moderate to moderately slow.  Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  Content of pebbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent in the A, E, and B horizons and from 0 to 15 percent in the C horizon.  Soil reaction is extremely acid to moderately acid.  Flakes of mica range from few to common in the B and C horizons of most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 to 8.  Iron depletions with chroma of 2 or less are within 24 inches of the upper boundary of the Bt horizon, but below a depth of 20 inches from the surface.  Soft masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown, yellow, or red are in subhorizons of the Bt horizon of many pedons.  Subhorizons of the Bt may lack a matrix color and have a pattern of colors in shades of yellow, brown, gray, or red.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam.\nA Btg horizon is present in some pedons.  Where present, it has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown or red are typically present.  Texture is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or clay loam.\nThe BC or CB horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Bt.  The BCg horizon, where present, has colors similar to the Btg horizon.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 8, and chroma of 3 to 8 and may be multicolored, or have iron accumulations or depletions in shades of yellow, brown, gray, or red.  Some pedons have a Cg horizon that is similar in color to the BCg horizon.  In each pedon, some part of the C horizon within a depth of 80 inches is not periodically saturated and lacks redoximorphic features.  Texture is sand to clay and is commonly stratified."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Abell, Altavista, Bertie, and Tetotum series in the same family.  Abell soils have a lithologic discontinuity in the Bt horizon.  Altavista soils are on nearly level to gently sloping stream terraces.  In addition, they have a fluctuating ground water table.  Bertie soils are on broad level areas of the lower Coastal Plain and have significant amounts of montmorillonite in the clay fraction.  Tetotum soils have more than 30 percent silt or 40 percent silt plus very fine sand in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon."

Slopes range from 8 to 65 percent.  The soils formed in fluvial and marine sediments of mixed mineralogy origin.   Mean annual precipitation is about 46 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F near the type location."

Craven and Gritney soils have more than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Goldsboro, Lynchburg, Noboco, and Norfolk soils have siliceous mineralogy.  State and Wickham soils are well drained.  All of these soils except Gritney are on gentler slopes."
