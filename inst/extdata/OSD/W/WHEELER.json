Kennewick soils have hard firm laminated silt loam above a depth of 40 inches and calcium carbonate equivalent of 6 percent or less.  Linoyer soils have 5 to 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Pocatello and Ritzcal soils have Bk horizons.  Pomot soils are hard to very hard dry in the control section, and have 12 to 17 percent clay and generally more than 5 percent coarser than very fine sand in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

Slopes range from about 12 to 75 percent and most areas have southerly exposures.  The soils formed in loess and silty alluvium from loess.  The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cold moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 8 to 13 inches including 1 to 4 feet of snow.  The frost free season is 100 to 140 days."
