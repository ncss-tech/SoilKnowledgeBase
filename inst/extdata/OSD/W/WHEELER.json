  "OVERVIEW": "The Wheeler series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loess and silty alluvium from loess.  They are on fan terraces and foothills with slopes of 12 to 75 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",
