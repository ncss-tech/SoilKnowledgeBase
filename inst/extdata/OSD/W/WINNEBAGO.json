  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Sola commonly are 122 to 183 cm (4 to 6 feet) thick and range from 107 to 274 cm (3.5to 9 feet) thick.  Loess mantle is less than 38 cm (15 inches) thick.\nThe Ap, A, and 2BA horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is normally silt loam, but it is loam or sandy loam in some pedons. Typically, reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral depending on liming treatment.\nThe 2Bt horizon has colors in the major part of the matrix with hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Hue of 5YR or redder is present on ped surfaces or in the matrix in at least one subhorizon. Some subhorizons in some pedons have hue of 10YR, or chroma higher than 4, or both. It is loam in the upper part and heavy sandy loam, light clay loam or loam in the lower part. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to strongly acid.  Some pedons range to very strongly acid in the middle part of the B horizon and to neutral in the lower part. A 2BC horizon darker colored than the Bt horizon is in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. It ranges from gravelly light sandy loam to loam where sola are thicker than 152 cm (5 feet); some pedons have stratified C horizons. Generally the upper part of the C horizon is neutral, but in some pedons the C horizon is moderately alkaline to the upper\nboundary."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Other soils in the same family are Atkinson, Burchard, Calmar, Cokato, Cresco, Cresent, Durand, Friesland, Griswold, Hitt, Jasper, Joslin, Keosauqua, Kishwaukee, Marbletown, Moingona, Morrill, Nuxmaruhanixete, Pana, Parmod,\nPenfield, Reedslake, Ringwood, Rockton, Schoolcraft, Shelby, Sibleyville, and Velma series. All of these soils except Atkinson, Calmar, Durand, Joslin, Morrill, Pana, and Rockton lack hue as red as 5YR in the B horizon. Atkinson, Calmar, and Rockton soils have more clay in the lower part of the B horizon which formed in residuum weathered from limestone. In addition, limestone berock is at depths of less than 102 cm (40 inches) in Calmar and Rockton soils and greater than 102 cm (40 inches) in Atkinson soils. Durand soils formed in 38 to 64 cm (15 to 25 inches) of loess. Joslin soils contain more clay in the lower part of the sola which formed in reddish clayey lacustrine\ndeposits. Morrill soils have thinner sola and are underlain by Kansan or Nebraskan till that has a low content of illite. Pana soils contain more sand and gravel in the lower part of the sola, are more acidic, and are deeper to free carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Winnebago soils are gently sloping to moderately steep on uplands. Slope ranges from 2 to 30 percent. Winnebago soils formed in layer of Wisconsin age loess less than 38 cm (15 inches) thick and in exhumed paleosols of Sangamon Age formed in sandy loam drift. The fresh glacial drift contains illite as the dominant clay mineral. It is believed that the part of the sola in drift was formed before the loess was deposited and that the climate may have been unlike the modern climate. The mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 12 degrees C (45 to 53 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 760 to 1020 mm (30 to 40 inches), mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range between 8 and 13 degrees C (47 to 55 degrees F), and frost free period ranges from 140 to 160 days."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The Durand soils are the closest associates. Others are the Argyle and Pecatonica soils. All these soils formed in a thicker mantle of loess. Westville soils are the Typic Hapludalf member of the biosequence. They formed in materials similar to those of the Winnebago soils."
