Wissikihon soils have a cryic temperature regime and an ustic moisture regime.  Gravels throughout the profile are primarily fine pea gravel less than 10 mm in diameter and there is a high proportion of medium, coarse, and very coarse angular sand in the sand fraction, inherited from granitic parent material.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
