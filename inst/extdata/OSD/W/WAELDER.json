    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no competing series.  Similar soils are the Guadalupe, Lincoln, Pulexas, Sandow, Uhland, Yahola, and Zavala series.  Guadalupe soils are calcareous throughout.  Lincoln soils have a sandy particle sized control section.  Pulexas, Yahola, and Zavala soils do not have a cambic horizon.  In addition, Zavala soils are in the hyperthermic temperature regime.  Sandow soils are in the fine-loamy family.  Uhland soils have cambic horizons, and are moderately well drained."
