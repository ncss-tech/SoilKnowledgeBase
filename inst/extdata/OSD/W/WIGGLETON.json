The soils formed in mixed alluvium derived from a variety of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks.  The soils are in a cool subhumid continental climate with annual precipitation of 13 to 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 33 to 40 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is about 53 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 5 to 60 days."
