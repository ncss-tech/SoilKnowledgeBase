  "OVERVIEW": "The Wiggleton series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in very gravelly stratified mixed alluvium.  Wiggleton soils are on stream and fan terraces, and outwash fans, and have slopes of 0 to 10 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 37 degrees F.",

The soils are in a cool subhumid continental climate with annual precipitation of 13 to 20 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 33 to 40 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is about 53 to 57 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 5 to 60 days."
