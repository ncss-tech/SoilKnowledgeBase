These soils are usually dry in the moisture control section for more than half the time when the soil temperature is above 40 degrees F. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick. The particle-size control section has moist bulk density of 1.10 to 1.25 g/cc, 30 to 60 percent volcanic glass content, including 5 to 15 percent sand-size pumice, 0.5 to 2.0 mm. in diameter and 5 to 10 percent ash, 2 to 5 mm. in diameter, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.15 to 0.40 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent, 5 to 20 percent rock fragments, and an apparent field estimated clay content of 8 to 10 percent. Depth to duripan is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to dense glacial till is 22 to 55 inches.\nThe A horizon has a chroma of 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has a value of 6 or 7 dry and 3 to 6 moist. Chroma is 1 or 2 dry and 1 to 3 moist. It has 5 to 20 percent rock fragments. Texture is ashy fine sandy loam, ashy very fine sandy loam or gravelly ashy fine sandy loam.\nThe 2Bkqm horizon has a value of 5 to 7 dry and 5 or 6 moist. Chroma is 1 or 2 moist. It is weakly or moderately cemented duripan and has 25 to 35 percent rock fragments and the fine earth.  When crushed texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam. Reaction is slightly to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cdk horizon has moist value of 5 or 6. It has 30 to 40 percent rock fragments and the fine earth texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam.

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wellsdam soils are on glaciated sideslopes and terraces leading up to the basalt plateau. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. The soils formed in volcanic ash and pumice mixed with loess over weakly cemented duripan and dense granitic glacial till. Elevation is 1,000 to 2,200 feet. The climate is characterized by warm dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches. Average January temperature is about 25 degrees F., average July temperature is about 70 degrees F., and average annual temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F. The frost free season is 140 to 180 days."
