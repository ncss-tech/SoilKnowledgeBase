The soil is moist less than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature is warmer than 41 degrees F.  These\nsoils are dry throughout from May through mid-November.  The soil\nis neutral or mildly alkaline in the surface layer and mildly to moderately alkaline below.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/3 or 6/4 and moist color of\n4/3 or 5/3.  It is stony or gravelly loam.\nThe Bt horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/4 or 6/6.  It is gravelly\nor very cobbly clay loam or loam and average 35 to 75 percent rock fragments."

Hoot soils have an E horizon\nat the surface and are noncalcareous except for Btk horizon thin carbonate coatings on some rock fragments.  Theon soils have soil temperature of 49 to 54 degrees F., a paralithic contact at a depth of 8 to 14 inches, a lithic contact at a depth of 10 to 20 inches, and an A1 horizon 1 to 2 inches thick.  Valley City soils are dominated by stone and cobble size fragments in the argillic horizon.  Vium soils are 8 to 14 inches to a lithic contact and contain 8 to 16 percent clay in the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Waucoba soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 30 to 85 percent.  The soils formed in residuum from metamorphic rocks.  The bedrock is fractured and has a thin calcareous layer, with opal coating on the underside of fragments\nand in vertical cracks.  Elevations are 5,000 to 8,000 feet.  Commonly the higher elevations occur on southern exposures.  The climate is arid, with hot, dry summers with infrequent thunder showers of short duration and cool, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches.  The mean January\ntemperature is 35 degrees F.  The frost free season is 185 to 235 days."
