Coarse fragments range from none to about 5 percent, by volume, pebbles or cobbles on the surface and in the profile.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 49 to 53 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 12 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has glazed coatings on peds with value of 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.  This horizon has weak prismatic or moderate subangular blocky or moderate angular blocky structure.\nThe Ccasi horizon has 20 to 50 percent of the upper boundary of the plates coated with silica cementation.  The Cca horizon has 15 to 20 percent calcium carbonate and is extremely hard or very hard.  The C horizon is stratified sandy loam, fine sandy loam, and loam."
