  "OVERVIEW": "The Weeks series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from mixed sources, including sandstone, quartzite and mica schist, with admixtures of loess.  Weeks soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 7 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
