  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact and thickness of the solum is 50 to 100 centimeters. The mean annual soil temperature is 12 to 15 degrees C and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 6 degrees C or more. The soils have a mesic temperature regime. The soil between depths of 25 and 78 centimeters or lithic contact, whichever is shallower, is dry in all parts from July 1 to October 1, and is moist in all parts from November 1 to May 15 in most years. The soils have a xeric soil moisture regime. The particle-size control section averages from 18 to 25 percent clay and averages from 45 to 70 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 2/2, 3/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/4 or 6/4.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/2, 3/3, 3/4, 4/2, 4/3; 7.5YR 5/4 or 6/4.  It is gravelly sandy loam, very gravelly loam or extremely gravelly sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 25 percent.  Gravel content ranges from 20 to 85 percent.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent.  Reaction is very strongly acid through neutral.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 50 to 80 percent.\nThe Bw horizon is 10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/3, 6/4, 7/3, 7/4; 7.5YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4 or 7/4.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4; 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4 or 5/6. It is very gravelly loam, sandy loam or sandy clay loam; extremely gravelly loam or sandy loam; or very cobbly loam or sandy loam.  Clay content ranges from 15 to 25 percent.  There is a slight increase in clay over the A horizon, but not enough to qualify for an argillic horizon.  Gravel content ranges from 15 to 70 percent, cobble content ranges from 5 to 50 percent, and stone content ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Total rock fragment content ranges from 35 to 75 percent. Reaction is very strongly acid through neutral.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 20 to 55 percent."
