  "OVERVIEW": "The Winnemucca series consists of very deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils.  They formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from intermediate volcanic materials on mountain meadows, mountaintops, and mountain slopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is 36 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation is 28 inches.",
