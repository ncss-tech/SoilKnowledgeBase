  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Westbrook soils were formerly mapped as Tidal marsh, undifferentiated.  Some of the Westbrook soils are classified and mapped at the great group or subgroup level.  Westbrook series was originally described as consisting of fibric organic materials. Current procedures for estimating fibers indicate that the materials are dominantly hemic.  These soils become extremely acid when drained.\nDiagnostic features and characteristics recognized in this pedon include:\nHistic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 40 centimeters (Oese1 and Oese2 horizons).\nHemic material--the zone from 0 to 122 centimeters has rubbed fiber content between 16 to 40 percent (Oese1, Oese2, and Oese3 horizons).\nSulfihemists great group--sulfidic materials within a depth of 100 centimeters. New pedons should include incubation pH measurements and or odor to determine if horizons should receive a 'se' subordinate distinction due to sulfate content.\nLoamy particle size class--mineral layer of silt loam 130 centimeters thick within the control section, from 122 to 250 centimeters (48 to 99 inches) (Cseg1 and Cseg2 horizons)\nReaction (pH value)--more than 4.5 throughout the control section."
