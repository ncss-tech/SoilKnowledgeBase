  "OVERVIEW": "The Westbrook series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic deposits over loamy mineral material.  They are in tidal marshes subject to inundation by salt water twice daily. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high to very high in the organic layers and low to high in the underlying mineral sediments. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C and mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the organic deposits ranges from 40 to 130 cm (16 to 51 in).  The soil is strongly acid to slightly alkaline and very slightly saline to strongly saline. In a 1:5 soil to water mixture by volume the conductivity ranges from 0.0 to 4.5 deciSiemens per meter. Thin lenses of silt and very fine sand are common in the organic horizons.\nThe surface tier is neutral or has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 0 to 3.  It is typically hemic materials but some pedons have fibric materials.  Organic matter content ranges from 20 to 80 percent or more.\nThe subsurface and bottom tiers are neutral or have hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 to 5 and chroma of 0 to 3.  The organic materials are dominantly hemic but some pedons have layers of fibric or sapric materials up to 30 cm (12 in) thick.  Organic matter content ranges from 20 to 90 percent and generally decreases with depth.\nThe C horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR to 5BG, value of 2 to 7 and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture ranges from sandy loam to silty clay loam but typically is silt, silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Organic matter content ranges from less than 5 percent to 20 percent.  Shell fragments and herbaceous fibers are common in the C horizon."

Bestpitch soils are underlain by clayey materials. Pawcatuck soils are underlain by sandy materials within a depth of 40 to 130 cm (16 to 51 in)."

Westbrook soils developed in partially decomposed organic material from salt tolerate herbaceous plants over loamy sediments.  Mean annual temperature is 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is 1000 to 1270 mm (40 to 50 in)."

Matunuck soils are mineral soils and have an organic surface layer less than 40 cm (16 in) thick.  Westbrook soils are near a wide variety of soils on nearby uplands formed in a glacial drift or marine deposited mineral materials."

The most common grasses are salt meadowgrass, salt water grass and spike grass.  Other vegetation includes blackgrass, sea lavender, saltwort, seaside goldenrod, aster, and purple gerardi.  In areas where the 1:5 EC by volume is below 1.5 deciSiemens per meter,  vegetation consists principally of tall reeds and sedges."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Westbrook soils were formerly mapped as Tidal marsh, undifferentiated.  Some of the Westbrook soils are classified and mapped at the great group or subgroup level.  Westbrook series was originally described as consisting of fibric organic materials. Current procedures for estimating fibers indicate that the materials are dominantly hemic.  These soils become extremely acid when drained.\nDiagnostic features and characteristics recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Histic epipedon - the zone from 0 to 30 centimeters (Oe horizon).\n2. Estimated fiber content indicates that the materials are dominantly hemic.\n3. Sulfidic materials are within 100 cm. of the surface. New pedons should include incubation pH measurements to determine if horizons should receive a 'se' subordinate distinction due to sulfate content.\n4. Loamy particle size class - mineral layer of silt loam 130 cm. thick within the control section - from 120 to 251 cm (48 to 99 in) (Cg1 and Cg2 horizons)\n5. Reaction (pH value) is more than 4.5 throughout the control section.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  This pedon is entered as 2008CT007001 in the National Soils Information System from the State of Connecticut Soil Survey manuscript.\nRefer to publication \"Tidal Marshes of Connecticut and Rhode Island,\" Hill, D. E. and Shearin, A. E., Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 709, Feb. 1970.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
