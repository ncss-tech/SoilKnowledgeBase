  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Whittington soils were formerly included with miscellaneous areas of water.  They are distinguished by being permanently covered by estuarine waters that support submersed aquatic vegetation.  These soils would classify in the proposed \"Subaquic\" subgroup.  The initial name proposed for this series was \"Fenwick\".  Refer to \"Subaqueous Soil Survey of Sinepuxent Bay, Maryland;\" G.P. Demas, J.H. Brown, and M.C. Rabenhorst; July 1998.\nDiagnostic horizons and other diagnostic soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon (oxidized)--the zone from 0 to 8 inches (A horizon)\nPeraquic feature--the zone from 0 to 60 inches is permanently saturated\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nData Map Unit ID: To be developed\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
