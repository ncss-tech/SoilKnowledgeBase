  "STATES": "MI,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wheatley series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in sandy and gravelly glaciofluvial deposits on lake terraces, outwash plains, lake plains, and valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about7.2 degrees C (45 degrees F).",
