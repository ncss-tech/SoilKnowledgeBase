  "OVERVIEW": "The Wunabuna series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in mineral slope alluvium overlying herbaceous organic material in potholes and closed depressions on till plains, moraines, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
