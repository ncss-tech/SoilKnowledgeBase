  "OVERVIEW": "The Waikomo series consists of shallow, well drained stony soils that formed in residuum weathered from basic igneous rock with a mixture of volcanic ash and alluvium.  Waikomo soils are on low elevation mountain slopes and have slopes of 2 to 6 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 1,143 millimeters (45 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C. (74 degrees F.)",
