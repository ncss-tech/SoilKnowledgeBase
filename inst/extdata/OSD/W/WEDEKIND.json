Crawley soils average 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent very fine sand and coarser sands in the particle-size control section.  Luppino soils are shallow to weathered granitic rock, have paralithic materials which are only 8 to 30 cm thick, and have harder bedrock within 50 cm of the soil surface. Nomisurvay has a lithic contact within 50 to 76 cm. Siscab soils are very shallow and shallow to weathered granite and are dominated by fine gravel in the particle-size control section."
