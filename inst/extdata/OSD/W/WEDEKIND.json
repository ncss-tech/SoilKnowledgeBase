  "OVERVIEW": "The Wedekind series consist of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from volcanic rocks.  Wedekind soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",

Crawley soils average 27 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent very fine sand and coarser sands in the particle-size control section.  Luppino soils are shallow to weathered granitic rock, have paralithic materials which are only 8 to 30 cm thick, and have harder bedrock within 50 cm of the soil surface. Nomisurvay has a lithic contact within 50 to 76 cm. Siscab soils are very shallow and shallow to weathered granite and are dominated by fine gravel in the particle-size control section."
