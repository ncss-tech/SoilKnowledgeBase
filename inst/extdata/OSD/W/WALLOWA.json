  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice. The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 47 degrees F. The solum and depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick and includes the upper part of the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. It has 5 to 10 percent gravel. It has an estimated volcanic glass content of 5 to 20 percent and Alox + 1/2Feox of 0.4 to 1.0 percent. The soil reaction is slightly acid to neutral. Organic matter is 4 to 6 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. It is silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and 15 to 25 percent coarser than very fine sand. It has 10 to 20 percent gravel. It has weak or moderate, prismatic and/or subangular blocky structure. The soil reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline."

The Wallowa and Wrightman soils are similar and should be further investigated."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Wallowa soils are on summits of plateaus and structural benches and occur as continuous bodies of soil and as mounds in patterned land. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent. Elevations are 3,400 to 5,000 feet. The soils formed in loess with an influence of volcanic ash in the upper part. The climate is characterized by cold wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches. The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 70 to 100 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Bocker, Hurwal, Powwatka, Snell, and Zumwalt soils. The Bocker soils are lithic and skeletal and commonly are in complex with the Wallowa soils. Hurwal and Powwatka soils have fine-silty argillic horizons. Hurwal soils are on north-facing slopes. Powwatka soils are on gently sloping plateaus and on side slopes. Snell soils are clayey-skeletal and are on adjacent side slopes. Zumwalt soils are in the fine family and are on very gently sloping foot slopes."
