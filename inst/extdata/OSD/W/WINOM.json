The soils are also moist for more than 45 consecutive days during the winter months between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils have at some time in most years, open cracks at a depth of 20 inches that are at least 1/2 inch wide and extend upward to the surface.   Also, they have between a depth of 10 and 40 inches, slickensides close enough to intersect.  The particle-size control section has 45 to 60 percent clay.  Depth to basalt or weathered volcanic tuff is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.\nThe upper part of the AC horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and 1 or 2 dry.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry."
