    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for more than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The soils are also moist for more than 45 consecutive days during the winter months between depths of 4 and 12 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils have at some time in most years, open cracks at a depth of 20 inches that are at least 1/2 inch wide and extend upward to the surface.   Also, they have between a depth of 10 and 40 inches, slickensides close enough to intersect.  The particle-size control section has 45 to 60 percent clay.  Depth to basalt or weathered volcanic tuff is 60 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and dry.\nThe upper part of the AC horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry, and chroma of 0 or 1 moist and 1 or 2 dry.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry."
