  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilton series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in a silty loess mantle overlying till.  Permeability is moderate in the silty loess mantle and moderately slow in the till.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes of 0 to 9 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 40 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the finer textured 2Bk horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  The silty loess mantle contains less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand and more than 18 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 inches to more than 30 inches in thickness and commonly includes most of the Bw horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2.  It is silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam with 18 to 27 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Faces of peds are coated with faint clay films in some pedons, but the soil does not have an argillic horizon.  The lower part of the Bw horizon extends into the underlying till in some pedons.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam or clay loam till containing 2 to 10 percent by volume gravel and stones.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It has few through many masses of carbonates.  Some pedons have a 2C horizon below the 2Bk horizon."

Grassna, Linton and Mandan soils are in areas where the silty loess mantle is more than 40 inches thick.  Grassna soils are in concave swales.  Temvik soils commonly are on adjacent slightly steeper slopes or slightly convex positions.  Linton and Temvik soils have mollic epipedons less than 16 inches thick.  Mandan soils are coarse-silty.\nWilliams soils are on nearby till plains, typically on higher lying parts of the landscape.  They have argillic horizons."
