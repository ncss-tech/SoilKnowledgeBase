Elevations are 4,200 to 5,200 feet.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and spring, and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 9 to 12 inches.  Average annual temperature is 42 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."

Zeph soils are poorly drained, have sandy-skeletal particle-size control sections and do not have a mollic epipedon.  Ajax soils are in depressions on flood plains.
