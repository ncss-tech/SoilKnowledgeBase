  "OVERVIEW": "The Wimpey series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in fine textured alluvium over flood deposited gravel.  Wimpey soils are on flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  Permeability is slow in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  The average annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the average annual temperature is 43 degrees F.",
