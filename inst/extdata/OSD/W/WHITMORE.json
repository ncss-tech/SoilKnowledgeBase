These soils formed in alluvium derived primarily from limestone of the Kaibab Formation.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations are 3,400 to 4,900 feet.  The climate is arid with hot summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is between 9 and 12 inches; mean annual air temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is about 180 to 240 days."
