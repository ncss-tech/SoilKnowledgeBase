  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitmore series consists of very shallow to a petrocalcic, well drained soils that are on ballenas and fan terraces.  Whitmore soils formed in alluvium and colluvium dominated by limestone.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

The climate is arid with hot summers and mild winters.  The mean annual precipitation is between 9 and 12 inches; mean annual air temperature is 57 to 63 degrees F.; and the frost-free season is about 180 to 240 days."
