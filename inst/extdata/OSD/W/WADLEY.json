Other areas remain in their natural vegetation or have been subdivided for residential development.  Natural vegetation consists mainly of live oak, turkey oak, bluejack oak, chapman oak, and longleaf pine in the overstory, and pineland threeawn, lopsided indiangrass, bluestems, panicums, scattered saw palmetto, blackberry, running oak, reindeer moss and other forbs in the understory."
