The mean annual soil temperature is about 59 to 61 degrees\nF.  Organic matter content is more than 1 percent at depth of 10 inches and less than 1 percent at depth of 20 inches.  Base saturation is more than 75 percent in all parts of the profile.  Pebbles range from 0 to 7 percent by volume.\nThe Ap or A horizon is very dark grayish brown, dark gray, dark grayish brown, brown or grayish brown (10YR 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3,\n5/3, 5/2). It is sandy loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon is light gray, light brownish gray, very pale\nbrown, or white (10YR 6/1, 6/2, 7/1, 7/2, 8/1, 8/2, 8/3). Some\npedons have yellowish brown, light yellowish brown, strong brown,\nor light brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6, 6/4; 7.5YR 5/6, 6/4) mottles with black (10YR 2/1) flakes and granules.  Texture is sandy loam,\nloam, sandy clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction is medium acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon is brown, gray, light brownish gray, pale brown,\nlight gray, or very pale brown (10YR 5/3, 6/1, 6/2, 6/3, 7/1, 7/2, 7/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2). Most horizons have mottles that are\nvariegated in colors of yellowish brown, brownish yellow, yellow, brown, light brown, pink, yellowish red or reddish yellow (10YR\n5/4, 6/6, 7/6,; 7.5YR 5/4, 6/4, 7/4, 8/4,; 5YR 4/6, 5/6, 6/6).  Texture is heavy clay loam or clay.  Reaction ranges from medium\nacid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have a BC horizon\nthat is similar in color to the Bt horizon except lacks mottles\nin hue of 5YR.  It is sandy clay loam or clay loam.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon is light gray, pale brown, very pale brown, yellow, light brown, or reddish yellow (2.5Y 7/2; 10YR 6/3, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4, 7/6, 8/3, 8/4; 7.5YR 6/4, 7/6). It is typically sandy clay loam or clay loam, but in a few pedons are strata of sandy loam.  This horizon ranges from medium acid to neutral."
