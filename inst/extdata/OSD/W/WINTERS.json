Some pedons lack a calcic horizon within 80 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is fine sandy loam or loam with 10 to 25 percent clay. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon above the calcic horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is sandy clay, clay loam, or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, sandy clay, or clay. The calcium carbonate equivalent content is 10 to 35 percent. Visible forms are mostly in soft powdery masses and concretions.\nThe B't horizon below the Btk horizon is red, reddish brown, reddish yellow, or yellowish red in hues 2.5YR or 5YR."

Castell soils are 20 to 40 inches to gneiss bedrock. Hamby soils formed in residuum and  lack secondary carbonates above 50 inches. Pedernales soils have calcic horizons within 30 to 45 inches. Truce soils have sola 40 to 60 inches thick and lack calcic horizons. Shatruce soils have sola 20 to 40 inches thick to clayey shale. Voca soils have sola 36 to 60 inches thick and a contact with fractured granite bedrock. Weswind soils have sola less than 60 inches thick and are moderately well drained. Wichita soils contain secondary carbonates within 30 inches of the surface. Acove soils have broken sandstone layers in the upper Bt horizon. Bluegrove soils are 20 to 40 inches to soft sandstone bedrock. Grandfield and Miles soils average less than 30 percent clay in the upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon."
