  "OVERVIEW": "The Wildmount series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in slope alluvuim and colluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone and quartzite rocks.  Wildmount soils are on mountain slopes and fan remnants.  Slopes are 25 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
