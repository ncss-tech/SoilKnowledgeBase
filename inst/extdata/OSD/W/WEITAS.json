  "OVERVIEW": "The Weitas series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and loamy colluvium from granitic or metamorphic rocks.  The Weitas soils are in concave positions, drainageways and slumps on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 50 percent.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the upper part and high in the lower part. The average annual precipitation is about 47 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
