  "OVERVIEW": "The Westplain soils consist of deep, poorly to somewhat poorly permeable soils formed on polylithologic alluvial sediments consisting of relatively fine textured materials deposited over sand and gravel.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on concave portions of alluvial fans and stream terraces.  Slopes range from O to about 5 percent.",
