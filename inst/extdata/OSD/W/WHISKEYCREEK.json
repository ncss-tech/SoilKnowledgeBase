  "OVERVIEW": "The Whiskeycreek series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from granite or gneiss. Whiskeycreek soils are on canyon sides of plateaus and have slopes of 20 to 75 percent. They have moderately rapid permeability. The average annual precipitation is about 25 inches and the average annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
