These soils formed in eolian deposits over alluvium from limestone and calcareous sandstone.  Elevations range from 4700 to 7100 feet.  The climate is semiarid with a mean annual precipitation of 8 to 14 inches occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain and snow.  The mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 54 degrees F.  The mean temperature for July is 71 degrees F. and for December is 31 degrees F.  The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 180 days."

The original site averaged 29 percent calcium carbonate equivalent.  New Mexico has correlated and published Winona as carbonatic or the mineralogy would be reclassified as mixed.\nUpdate and revisions for the correlation of Little Colorado River Area (AZ707), Sept. 2011, CEM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
