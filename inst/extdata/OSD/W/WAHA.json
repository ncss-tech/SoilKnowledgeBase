  "OVERVIEW": "The Waha series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in loess and residuum and colluvium from basalt.  They are on foothills, mountains, and canyon walls.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 21 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Solum thickness and depth to bedrock range from 20 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 30 inches in thickness.  The soils are neutral to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It has weak or moderate structure.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 to 4 dry.  It is heavy silt loam or silty clay loam.  It has weak or moderate blocky or prismatic structure.\nThe 2Bt horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or silty clay loam with 20 to 85 percent basalt fragments."
