These soils are usually moist but are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches. These soils are neutral or slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It has moderate granular or blocky structure.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chromas of 3 or 4 dry or moist. It is clay loam or sandy clay loam.  This horizon has weak or moderate prismatic and blocky structure.  It has 30 to 40 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has the same color range as the B horizon, and is silt loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are at elevations between 1,900 and 2,300 feet on nearly level to sloping old fans in the valleys near the communities of Plain and Winton.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  They formed in old alluvium of clay loam, sandy clay loam, and silt loam washed from the nearby mountains.  There is an admixture of loess and a little volcanic ash in the surface layer of these soils.  The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches. The mean January temperature is 25 degrees F.; the mean July temperature is 69 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The average frost free season is 75 to 120 days."
