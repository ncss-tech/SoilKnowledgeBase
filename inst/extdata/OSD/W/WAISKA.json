  "OVERVIEW": "The Waiska series consists of excessively drained soils formed in gravelly and sandy material on glacial lake benches, stream terraces and outwash plains. Permeability is rapid to very rapid in the upper part and very rapid in the lower part.  Slopes range from 0 to 70 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum thickness ranges from about 30 to 50 inches.  Rock fragments are composed of red and white sandstone, granites, schists, shales and other dark materials.  Gravel content ranges from 5 to 60 percent in the upper 10 inches and from 35 to 75 percent in the remainder of the pedon.  Cobble content ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and 5 to 20 percent in the substratum.  Stone content is 0 to 10 percent throughout.  Total content of rock fragments in the particle size control section is between 35 and 90 percent.  The pedon is extremely acid to moderately acid throughout.\nSome pedons have an A horizon that has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.  The E horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR or 7.5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  The E is often thin and discontinuous.  The A and E horizons are sand, loamy sand, sandy loam, or the gravelly or cobbly analogues of these textures.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3. The Bs horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 3 to 6. The Bhs or Bs horizons are sand, coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam or the gravelly, cobbly, very gravelly, or very cobbly analogs of these textures.  The BC horizon is sand, gravelly loamy coarse sand, gravelly coarse sand, gravelly sand, or the very gravelly analogs of these textures.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. The C horizon is very gravelly sand, extremely gravelly sand, very gravelly coarse sand, or extremely gravelly coarse sand.  The C horizon is coarsely stratified in many pedons."

Brownstone soils have a lithic contact with sandstone bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Grotto soils have a xeric moisture regime and occur at higher elevations.  Guardlake soils have thicker sola and have less acid substrata.  Marblemount soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Teneriffe soils have a volcanic ash mantle.  Traunik soils lack moist value and chroma of 3 or less in the spodic horizons and have free carbonates at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
