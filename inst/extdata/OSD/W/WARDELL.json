    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum commonly is 30 to 42 inches and ranges from 22 to 58 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1, 2, or 3. It is loam or sandy clay loam and less commonly sandy loam or silt loam. Reaction is medium acid, slightly acid, or neutral.\nThe B horizon has either hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 6 or 7, and chroma of 1 or 2 or hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1. It is clay loam, sandy clay loam, or loam, with silt loam and silty clay loam being less common. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 1 or 2, and have brown colors in deep sandy strata. The C horizon is stratified and the strata vary in thickness and sequence within short horizontal distances. Textures of the strata range from clayey to sandy. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wardell soils typically occur on level to nearly level areas of old flood plains and old natural levees. Slope gradients range from 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in loamy alluvium probably of old Mississippi River origin and may be partially reworked by tributary streams. Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Amagon, Forestdale, Gideon, Tuckerman, Alligator, Askew, Beulah, Bosket, Dubbs, Dundee, and Sharkey soils. Alligator, Gideon, and Sharkey soils occur on similar landscapes or in depressions and old channels. Alligator and Sharkey soils have clayey textures throughout and Gideon soils lack argillic horizons. Askew, Beulah, Bosket, Dubbs, and Dundee soils occur on higher or more sloping areas of natural levees or terraces. Askew, Dubbs, and Dundee soils have fine-silty argillic horizons. Beulah soils have coarse-loamy control sections. Bosket soils have less than 18 percent clay in their argillic horizons."
