    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The solum is 35 to 55 inches thick or more. Depth to bedrock is 40 to 60 inches or more. Channers and parachanners of siltstone and shale, as well as iron-rich siliceous and calcareous concretions (or fragments weathered from these concretions) range from 0 to 2 percent in the upper part of the solum; 0 to 20 percent in the lower part of the solum; and from 0 to 65 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the surface layer; very strongly acid to neutral in the solum; and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BA horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Fine-earth texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon (where present) has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. Fine-earth texture is silt loam, silty clay loam, silty clay or clay.\nThe Cr horizon weathered interbedded shale and siltstone."
