Channers and parachanners of siltstone and shale, as well as iron-rich siliceous and calcareous concretions (or fragments weathered from these concretions) range from 0 to 2 percent in the upper part of the solum; 0 to 20 percent in the lower part of the solum; and from 0 to 65 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from extremely acid to neutral in the surface layer; very strongly acid to neutral in the solum; and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BA horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon (where present) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6. Fine-earth texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe C horizon (where present) has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.
