  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Windlass series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in loamy alluvium over sand and gravel. These soils are on outwash plains, alluvial fans, flood plains and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
