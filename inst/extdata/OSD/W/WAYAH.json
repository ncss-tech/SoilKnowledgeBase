    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Breakneck, Burton, Cataloochee, Guyot, Oconaluftee, and Tanasee series. Breakneck and Burton soils have a lithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Cataloochee soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Guyot soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Oconaluftee soils have C horizons of saprolite weathered from low-grade metasedimentary rocks. Tanasee soils formed on colluvial benches, fans, and toeslopes, and do not have C horizons of saprolite."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wayah soils are on gently sloping to very steep ridges and side slopes in the Southern Blue Ridge mountains, MLRA 130B.  Elevation commonly ranges from about 4800 to 6600 feet. On north and east aspects this soil may occur at somewhat lower elevations. Slope ranges from 2 to 95 percent. Wayah soils formed in residuum that is affected by soil creep in the upper part, and weathered from felsic to mafic igneous and high-grade metamorphic rocks such as granite, mica gneiss,  and hornblende gneiss. Mean annual temperature is about 40 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is about 100 inches near the type location. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 60 to 110 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F. Moist atmospheric conditions in the form of fog and cloud cover are prevalent throughout the year in these high mountain areas."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: In addition to the competing Burton and Tanasee series, these are the Balsam, Clingman, Craggey, and Longhope series. Balsam soils formed in colluvium on benches, fans, and toeslopes, and are in a loamy-skeletal particle-size class. Clingman and Craggey soils have a lithic contact less than 20 inches deep. Longhope soils are very poorly drained and have organic horizons 16 to 30 inches thick overlying mineral soil material. They occur in broad drainageways or fens (locally referred to as \"bogs\")."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the acreage is in State or Federal ownership and is used for watershed protection, recreation, and wildlife habitat. In areas higher than about 5400 feet, red spruce and fraser fir are the dominant trees. At the lower elevations, northern red oak, chestnut oak, American beech, yellow birch, black cherry, sugar maple, eastern hemlock, and yellow buckeye are common trees. In many areas, the trees are stunted due to wind and ice damage and a \"windswept\" phase is recognized.  Common understory plants are serviceberry, striped maple, American chestnut sprouts, silverbell, pin cherry, rhododendron, flame azalea, blueberry, hay-scented fern, woodfern, New York fern, blue grass, and sedges.  A small acreage is covered by heath balds. These balds are vegetated with rhododendron, mountain laurel, blueberry, flame azalea, hawthorn, and mountain ash. A small acreage is used for native pasture and Christmas tree production."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Wayah series was formerly included with the Burton and Porters series. However, Burton soils have bedrock at depths of 20 to 40 inches below the surface, and Porters soils are mesic.\nThe 1/97 revision placed Wayah soils in a fine-loamy family. This series was previously placed in a coarse-loamy family. Laboratory PSA (pipette method) and corresponding field texture estimates (feel method) indicate control section clay contents of generally 12 to 24 percent, with most pedons marginally coarse-loamy. Fine-loamy particle-size class placement is based on the presence of amorphous (non-crystalline) clay-size material associated with the relatively high organic matter content found in these soils. Although field estimates, laboratory measurements, and calculated values may vary, clay content in the particle-size control section is generally less than 25 percent. Although Wayah soils may exhibit some of the characteristics of andic soil properties, they lack the volcanic glass found in soils of similar taxa in the Western United States.\nThe Wayah series has the following diagnostic horizons and features:\nUmbric epipedon - The zone from the mineral soil surface to a depth of 18 inches having value of 3 or less, moist, and 5 or less, dry (A1 and A2 horizons).\nCambic horizon - The zone from 18 to 44 inches below the surface (Bw horizon).\nIsotic mineralogy class - In more than one-half of the control section, a 1500 kPa water to clay ratio of 0.6 or more and a pH in NaF solution of more than 8.4.\nRevised: 10/92-DJT,SAB,AG; 1/97-DHK, 12/97-DHK; 3/03-MKC\n02/11-BPS: Taxonomic Classification -- 11th Keys, update competing and associated series, MLRA clarification\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data is available from the National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, NE for the following pedons: S85NC-099-001, S88NC-121-009, S88NC-121-010, S88NC-199-009, S91NC-021-005, S91NC-121-005A and S91NC-021-006.\nNASIS Data Map Unit ID: NASIS data for the typical pedon in Jackson County, NC are represented by DMU # 369469.\nMLRA: 130B SIR(s): NC0188, NC0187 (STONY)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
