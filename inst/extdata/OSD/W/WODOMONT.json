  "OVERVIEW": "The Wodomont series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils on hills of plateaus and mesas.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from calcareous sedimentary rocks.  Slope is 2 to 45 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F.",
