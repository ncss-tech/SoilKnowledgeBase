  "OVERVIEW": "The Willhill series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and residuum derived from rhyolitic tuff. Willhill soils are on hills and plateaus. Slopes are 3 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 280 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
