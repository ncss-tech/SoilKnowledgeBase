    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wampoo soils are on gently to moderately sloping old broad alluvial fans at elevations of 3,400 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in mixed alluvium from dominantly volcanic sources.  The climate is semiarid continental.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from l2 to l6 inches. Precipitation occurs mainly as summer thundershowers and gentle winter rains.  The frost-free season is l80 to 230 days."
