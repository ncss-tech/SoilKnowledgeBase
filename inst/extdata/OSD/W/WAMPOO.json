  "OVERVIEW": "The Wampoo series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in old alluvium from dominantly basic igneous sources.  Wampoo soils are on high broad alluvial fans and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about l4 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",

These soils formed in mixed alluvium from dominantly volcanic sources.  The climate is semiarid continental.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F., and the average annual precipitation ranges from l2 to l6 inches. Precipitation occurs mainly as summer thundershowers and gentle winter rains.  The frost-free season is l80 to 230 days."
