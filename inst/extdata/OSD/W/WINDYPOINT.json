  "OVERVIEW": "The Windypoint series consists of very deep, well drained soils, that formed in alluvium from mixed sources.  They are on terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

Abgese soils have 18 to 25 percent average clay content in the control section.  Ackley, Greenbrae, Hoosegow, and Lankbush soils are noncalcareous above 34 inches.  Blacknest soils lack a layer of lime accumulation above the sand and gravel.  Colbar, and Sidlake soils have bedrock at 20 to 40 inches.  Esha soils have average annual soil temperature of 53 to 59 degrees F.  Eusbio and Stiles soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Hardtrigger soils have a weakly cemented layer above 40 inches and have a Cr horizon.  Harsan soils have a moderately fine textured Bk horizon in the lower part of the profile.  Morfitt soils lack loose sand and gravel above 40 inches.  Paulville and Turria soils have less than 35 percent fine sand and coarser in the control section.  Sevy and Zane soils have hue of 7.5YR or redder.  Shawave soils have average annual soil temperature of 53 to 56 degrees F. and have less than 25 percent clay in the particle-size control section."
