  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitewolf series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium.  Whitewolf soils are on flood plains and alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 inches, and the mean annual temperature is 64 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil between the depths of 12 and 22 inches is dry more than half the year.  The moisture regime is aridic bordering on xeric.  The mean annual soil temperature is 62 degrees to 70 degrees F.  Coarse fragments ranging from 2 mm to 2 cm occupy 0 to 15 percent of the profile.  Reaction is slightly acid to moderately alkaline throughout.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent at depth of 10 inches.\nThe A horizon has a dry color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, or 4/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  It is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, loamy coarse sand, sandy loam, or course sandy loam.  Clay content is 0 to 10 percent.\nThe C horizon has a dry color of 10YR 5/3, 5/4, 6/3, 6/4; 2.5Y 8/2.  Moist color is 10YR 3/3, 3/4 or 4/4.  It is loamy sand, sand, or loamy coarse sand.  Some pedons contain disseminated lime below a depth of 40 inches."

Cinco soils have slopes of 50 to 75 percent and have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Arnold, Baywood, Calhi, Corralitos, Delhi, and Tujunga soils have a xeric moisture regime.  Gorgonio soils have an irregular decrease of organic matter to a depth of 20 inches."

Elevations are 400 to 4,000 feet.  The climate is semiarid with hot, dry summers, and moist, mild winters.  Average annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  Average January temperature is 47 degrees F; average July temperature is 85 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 60 degrees to 70 degrees F.  Freeze-free season is 200 to 300 days."
