  "REVDATE": "03/2002",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wadenill series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in loamy glacial till.  They occur on undulating to steep ground moraines with slopes of 2 to 25 percent.  Permeability is moderately rapid. Mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum and depth to free carbonates ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 12 and 18 percent clay but some individual subhorizons have up to 22 percent clay.  Total sand content ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  Coarse fragments of mixed lithology comprise 5 to 15 percent (by volume) of the solum and substratum.  Reaction of solum is medium acid to neutral.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  The AB horizon is similar to the A or Ap but includes chroma of 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin faint clay films with value and/or chroma 1 unit lower.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The upper part of some pedons may qualify for calcic horizon.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 12 to 25 percent.  Relic mottles with chroma of 2 through 8 typically are present."

Becker, Bolan, Carmi, Dickinson, Flagler, Ridgeport, and Zenor soils have more than 80 percent in the lower part of the control section.  Bertram and Etter soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Lowlein soils have thin subhorizons with more than 80 percent sand in the upper part of the control section and more than 27 percent clay and some gravel in the lower part. Olin soils have more than 80 percent sand in the upper part of the control section and some gravel in the lower part.   Clarion and Ves soils are fine-loamy."

They formed in a high sand, low shale bearing till associated with the Wadena Lobe of the Wisconsinan Age glaciation.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches."

The very poorly drained Glencoe soils are in depressions.  The well drained Sunburg soils are on more convex ridges and knolls."
