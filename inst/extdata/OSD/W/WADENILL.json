(0 to 6 inches thick)\nBw1--10 to 18 inches; dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) fine sandy loam, weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; few roots; 14 percent coarse fragments; slightly acid; clear wavy boundary.\nBw2-18 to 31 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam, weak medium subangular blocky structure; friable; 7 percent coarse fragments; neutral; clear wavy boundary.  (Combined thickness of Bw horizons is 12 to 24 inches.)\nC--31 to 60 inches; yellowish brown (10YR 5/4) fine sandy loam; few fine distinct grayish brown (10YR 5/2) and common medium distinct yellowish brown (10YR 5/6) relic mottles; massive; friable; 8 percent coarse fragments; few threads and masses of calcium carbonate; strong effervescence; mildly alkaline."

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum and depth to free carbonates ranges from 18 to 40 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  The 10- to 40-inch control section averages between 12 and 18 percent clay but some individual subhorizons have up to 22 percent clay.  Total sand content ranges from 45 to 65 percent.  Coarse fragments of mixed lithology comprise 5 to 15 percent (by volume) of the solum and substratum.  Reaction of solum is medium acid to neutral.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  The AB horizon is similar to the A or Ap but includes chroma of 3.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Some pedons have thin faint clay films with value and/or chroma 1 unit lower.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly or moderately alkaline.  The upper part of some pedons may qualify for calcic horizon.  The calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 12 to 25 percent.  Relic mottles with chroma of 2 through 8 typically are present."

Becker, Bolan, Carmi, Dickinson, Flagler, Ridgeport, and Zenor soils have more than 80 percent in the lower part of the control section.  Bertram and Etter soils have a lithic contact at depths of less than 40 inches.  Lowlein soils have thin subhorizons with more than 80 percent sand in the upper part of the control section and more than 27 percent clay and some gravel in the lower part. Olin soils have more than 80 percent sand in the upper part of the control section and some gravel in the lower part.   Clarion and Ves soils are fine-loamy."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wadenill soils are on undulating to steep ground moraines with complex slopes of 2 to 25 percent.  They formed in a high sand, low shale bearing till associated with the Wadena Lobe of the Wisconsinan Age glaciation.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 49 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 22 to 28 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Delft, Glencoe, Sunburg, and Terril soils.  The poorly drained Delft and moderately well drained Terril soils are in concave swales and on toe slopes and have a mollic epipedon greater than 24 inches thick.  The very poorly drained Glencoe soils are in depressions.  The well drained Sunburg soils are on more convex ridges and knolls."
