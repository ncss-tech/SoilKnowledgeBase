  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to a seasonal water table ranges from 18 to 36 inches.  The particle-size control section has 10 to 18 percent clay.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 37 to 40 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature ranges from 58 to 61 degrees F. These soils are saturated in some subhorizons for at least a few days when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry. It commonly is moderately alkaline but ranges to very strongly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist and 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 4 moist and dry.  It commonly is loam or fine sandy loam, and less commonly silt loam.  In some pedons there are thin stratified layers of sand and loamy coarse sand.  The C horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe IIC horizon is lacking in some pedons, but where present it has value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is coarse sand or sand.  Gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent."
