  "OVERVIEW": "The Walters series includes Gray Wooded soils intergrades of alluvial soils developed in stratified medium and moderately coarse alluvium on high bottomlands or low terraces of the larger streams in intermountain valleys of the Northern Rocky Mountains.  These soils like mainly above present flood levels and have developed under both a domiant conifersous forest and mixed forest of conifer, deciduous trees and shrubs and some grasses.  The parent alluvium, largely reworked from glacial drift, is derived from gray, green and reddish argillites and quartzites and dolomitic limestones of the Belt geological formation.  Walters soils occupy the same general alluvial plains as the Swims, Kiwanis and Birch soils and may be closely associated with these soils.  They differ from Swims soils mainly in having coarser textured subsoils and much coarser substrata at relatively shallow depths as in Birch soils.  Aside from a thin, 1 or 2 inch dark surface mulch, Walters soils have much lighter colored A horizons than Kiwanis soils, associated Chernozemic Regosol intergrades of Alluvial soils.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:\nThe Walters series have a gray to brown surface soil about 10 inches thick.  They have a pale brown loamy subsoil with only weak structure.   The Walters soils are more sandy below a depth of 2 feet and grade into stratified sandy loams and sands.\nVariations in the Walters soils are chiefly in the thickness of horizons and in the depth to free lime carbonate.  In some places the soils are weakly calcareous immediately below the A2 horizon.  In some places in plowed fields they are calcareous in the Ap horizon.  The A1 horizon is from 1.4 to 1.2 inch thick, and in places it is barely visible.  Locally, a sprinkling of fine and medium-size gravel occurs in all horizons and stratified sand and gravel occurs below depths of 3 to 4 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nAs of 4/2009 this series is being entered into the OSD files for the first time.  Even though it was established in 1958, it never existed in an electronic format.  The series has not been reviewed or updated, except for the classification.  Walters series were originally classified as Coarse-loamy, mixed Typic Cryochrepts.  There were multiple older versions of this OSD in the .a file which did not match the TUD from the Upper Flathead Valley Area, Montana manuscript.  Because of the discrepancies, the TUD profile was used for the OSD pedon.  Anyone with a more recent copy of the OSD is encouraged to submit it to the MO-4 Regional Office for processing.  This series should be investigated in the future to determine the central concept and update the OSD."
