  "OVERVIEW": "The Swims series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous alluvium derived from argillite, quartzite, and dolomitic limestone from the Belt formation. These soils are on high bottom lands and low terraces. Slopes are 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 410 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
