  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1. This series was established to recognize Andic soil properties in tills of the cryic areas in the Adirondack High Peaks Region of New York. Some pedons lacking E horizons will key out as Pachic or Typic Fulvicryands. These are similar soils in use and management to the Andic Humicryods concept.\nDiagnostic horizons and feature recognized in this pedon are:\na. Albic horizon - the zone from 9 to 10 inches (E horizon).\nb. Spodic horizon - the zone from 10 to 35 inches (Bhs horizons).\nc. Humic feature - have more than 6 percent organic carbon throughout the upper 4 inches of the spodic horizon.\nd. Andic feature - andic soil properties throughout horizons that have a total thickness of 10 inches or more within 30 inches either of the mineral soil surface or of the top of an organic layer with andic soil properties, whichever is shallower (Bhs1, Bhs2, and Bhs3 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA: NSSL laboratory data is available for the following pedons: S93-NY-031-001, S93-NY-031-006 (OSD pedon), S93-NY-031-007, and S94- NY-031-002.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
