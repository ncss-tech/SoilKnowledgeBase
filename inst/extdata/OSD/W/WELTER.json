  "REVDATE": "12/2003",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Welter series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from semi-consolidated acid shale or in colluvium derived from the shale.  These soils are on sedimentary plains and hills.  Slopes are 4 to 45 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
