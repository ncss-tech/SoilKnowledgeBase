  "OVERVIEW": "The Wegatchie series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in silty glacial lake deposits. They are in level or depressional areas on lake plains and in basins on uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual temperature is 43 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 40 inches. Bedrock is at depths greater than 60 inches. The depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 60 inches. Rock fragments, mostly gravel, range from 0 to 2 percent by volume in the solum and from 0 to 10 percent in the C horizon. Unless limed, reaction ranges from moderately acid through neutral in the surface layer, from slightly acid through slightly alkaline in the subsoil, and from neutral through moderately alkaline in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon is neutral or has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, very fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe B horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe BC horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is similar to the B horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 6. Chroma of 3 through 6 is restricted to depths greater than 30 inches. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is very fine sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam and it is commonly varved."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Depeyster and Hailesboro soils, and Adjidaumo, Depeyster, Munuscong, Malone, Insula, and Summerville soils. The moderately well drained Depeyster soils and somewhat poorly drained Hailesboro soils are drainage associates on slightly higher landscape positions. Adijidaumo occupies similar landscape positions but has a fine particle-size control section. Malone soils are nearby but have a higher rock fragment content. The Munuscong soils are on similar landscape positions but are in a coarse-loamy over clayey family. The Insula and Summerville soils are shallow to bedrock and are on nearby bedrock controlled ridges."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity in the mineral soil surface and subsurface layers is moderately high or high. It is moderately low to high in the subsoil and substratum."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: 1). Originally Wegatchie was classified in the great group of Haplaquolls. Because of changes established in the 6th edition of `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the new great group of Endoaquepts. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified.\n2). Very poorly drained has been removed from the range of this series. Use of mucky modifiers in the A horizon and thin O horizons above the A are dropped.\n3). Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na). Cambic horizon - the zone from 8 to 40 inches (Bg1, Bg2, And BCg horizon).\nb). Mollic subgroup - has an Ap horizon with value of 3 or less moist, and 5 or less dry; and Ap layer is less than 10 inches thick.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
