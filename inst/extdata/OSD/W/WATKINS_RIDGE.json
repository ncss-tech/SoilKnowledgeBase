  "OVERVIEW": "The Watkins Ridge series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in alluvium and residuum from limestone, sandstone and shale.  These soils are on rolling foothills and mountainsides and have slopes of 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 8 to 18 inches thick.  The 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section is loam, silt loam, or clay loam and averages 18 to 35 percent clay and has up to 30 percent cobbles and gravel in some pedons.  Strong horizons of carbonate accumulation occur immediately below the A horizon.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 45 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist but is dry more than 60 consecutive days in all parts of the 4 to 12 inch depth in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 to 4 moist and chroma of 1 to 3.  It has weak thick platy or fine granular structure at the surface and weak fine and medium granular or subangular blocky structure below.  This horizon is slightly calcareous to strongly calcareous after the upper 7 inches are mixed.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist and chroma of 2 to 5.  Textures include loam, silt loam, clay loam, gravelly clay loam and cobbly clay loam.  The Bk horizon is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline and moderately calcareous to very strongly calcareous with soft powdery carbonate and some weak cementation in some subhorizons."

These soils formed in mixed alluvium.  The climate is moist subhumid with average annual precipitation of 14 to 20 inches falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 42 to 44 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 63 degrees F.  The average freeze-free period is about 60 to 90 days."

Clegg soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and have argillic horizons overlying calcic horizons.  Deer Creek soils have fine textured argillic horizons with more than 35 percent clay overlying the calcic horizons and the upper boundary of the Bt horizon has an abrupt textural change.  Lizzant and Dennot soils have a loamy-skeletal particle-size control section.  Canburn soils have a mollic epipedon more than 24 inches thick.
