  "OVERVIEW": "The Waikane series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered in alluvium and colluvium from basic igneous rock.  Waikane soils are on fans and terraces and have slopes of 3 to 70 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 60 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F.",
