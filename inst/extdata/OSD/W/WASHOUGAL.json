Washougal soils are on river terraces and terrace escarpments and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 F.",

The particle-size class is based on the thickest part between 0 and 40 inches since there are no qualifying strongly contrasting layers.\nMore investigation is needed to determine whether the organic carbon meets the criteria for a melanic epipedon."
