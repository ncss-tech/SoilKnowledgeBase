  "OVERVIEW": "The Washougal series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium from volcanic ash, basalt and andesite.  Washougal soils are on river terraces and terrace escarpments and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 48 F.",

The particle-size class is based on the thickest part between 0 and 40 inches since there are no qualifying strongly contrasting layers.\nMore investigation is needed to determine whether the organic carbon meets the criteria for a melanic epipedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
