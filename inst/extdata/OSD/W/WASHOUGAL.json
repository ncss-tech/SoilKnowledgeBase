The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.\nThe A and AC horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 25 percent in the A horizon and 35 to 60 percent in the AC horizon.  The A and AC horizons are very strongly acid or slightly acid.\nThe C horizon as hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very cobbly coarse sandy loam, extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam or extremely gravelly loamy sand.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  Pebbles range from 20 to 50 percent, cobbles from 15 to 25 percent and stones from 0 to 10 percent.

Washougal soils are at elevations of 50 to 800 feet and have slopes of 0 to 60 percent.  Climate is mild; with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters.  The annual precipitation is 50 to 90 inches.  Average January temperature is 32 F, average July temperature is 64 F, and the mean annual temperature is 47 to 50 F.  Frost-free season ranges from 150 to 180 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification only changed 4/94 because of recent amendments to Soil Taxonomy.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\nAndic properties - from 0 to 30 inches\nMelanic epipedon 0 from 0 to 30 inches with assumed weighted average organic carbon content of more than 6 percent\nParticle-size control section - from 0 to 40 inches with 0 to 22 inches being medial; 22 to 30 inches being medial-skeletal; 30 to 36 inches being loamy-skeletal; and 36 to 40 inches being sandy-skeletal.  The particle-size class is based on the thickest part between 0 and 40 inches since there are no qualifying strongly contrasting layers.\nMore investigation is needed to determine whether the organic carbon meets the criteria for a melanic epipedon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
