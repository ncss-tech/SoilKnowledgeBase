  "OVERVIEW": "The Wospring series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils that formed in residuum from travertine. Wospring soils are on travertine terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters, and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",

Vertine soils are moderately deep to cemented travertine layers, and are above Wospring soils on travertine terraces. Wover soils have a histic epipedon and are found on travertine terraces adjacent to Wospring soils."
