  "OVERVIEW": "The Wapshilla series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess mixed with basalt colluvium.  Wapshilla soils are on high plateaus, mountain slopes and higher north-facing canyon slopes and have slopes of 8 to 90 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
