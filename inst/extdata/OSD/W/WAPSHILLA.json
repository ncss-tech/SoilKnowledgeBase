    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wapshilla soils are on high plateaus, mountains, and high north-facing canyon walls, and have gradients of 8 to 90 percent.  They formed in loess mixed with basalt colluvium.  Elevations are 3,500 to 5,000 feet.  The climate is humid with snowy winter and moderately warm dry summers.  Average annual precipitation is 26 to 28 inches.  Average January temperature is 24 degrees F.; average July temperature is 65 degrees F.  Average annual temperature is 41 degrees to 45 degrees F.  Frost-free season is about 60 to 80 days."
