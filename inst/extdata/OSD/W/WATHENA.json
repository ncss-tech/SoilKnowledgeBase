  "OVERVIEW": "The Wathena series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in sandy alluvium. Wathena soils are on nearly level to rolling natural levees on flood plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 4 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 37 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 54 degrees F.",
