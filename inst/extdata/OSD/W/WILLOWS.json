  "OVERVIEW": "The Willows series consists of very deep, poorly to very poorly drained sodic soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Willows soils are in flood basins.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 60 degrees to 62 degrees F.  The soils have cracks more than 1mm. wide to a depth of 20 inches or more and the cracks remain open through summer and autumn (unless irrigated) and are closed during winter and spring.  Some or all of the lower part of the A horizon has slickensides that intersect and the upper part of some Bk horizons have slickensides. Exchangeable sodium content is greater than 15 percent within 40 inches of the surface.\nThe Apg and Bssg horizons have dry colors of 10YR 6/2, 6/1, 5/2 5/1, 4/1; N5/0, N4/0; 5Y 5/1, 4/1 or 4/2; 2.5Y 5/2, 4/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/1; N3/0; 5Y 3/1; 2.5Y 3/2, 3/1.  Some part of or all of the Apg horizon has distinct or prominent mottles.  The Apg horizon ranges from clay to silty clay.  The uppermost part of the Apg horizon usually has granular or fine blocky structure; the remainder of the Apg horizon and Bssg usually have weak to strong coarse prismatic structure or weak to moderate coarse blocky structure.  The Apg horizon is slightly acid to very strongly alkaline and except where the soil has been plowed and mixed is least acid at the surface and increases sharply as depth increases.  The lower part has exchangeable sodium of more than 15 percent.\nThe Bknssg horizons have dry color of 10YR 6/4, 6/3, 5/4, 5/3; 2.5Y 6/2, 5/2; N6/0, N5/0; 5Y 6/4, 6/3, 6/2, 6/1, 5/2, 5/1 or 4/2; 2.5Y 6/4.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/4, 4/3, 3/4, 3/3; 2.5Y 4/4, 4/2, 3/2; N4/0, N3/0; 5Y 4/2, 4/1, 3/2 or 3/1.  Some part of the Bknssg horizons usually contains distinct or prominent mottles but they may be lacking where the soil has olive colors.  The Bknssg horizons are clay or silty clay to a depth of 40 inches or more.  Reaction is usually strongly alkaline and the pH ranges from a little less than 8.5 to a little more than 9.0. Exchangeable sodium is more than 15 percent.  All parts are weakly to strongly calcareous and usually calcium carbonate concretions are in the upper part. Gypsum or salt crystals or both are common.\nThe Bnssg horizons have similar colors and textures as the Bknssg horizons and may be lacking in some pedons."

Hildreth soils are somewhat poorly drained and lack any exchangeable sodium in the profile.  They are commonly found in intermittent drainageways.  Jacktone soils have a duripan between 20 to 40 inches.  Maxwell soils have a Calcium-Magnesium ratio of 2:1 or less. Subaco soils are underlain by siltstone at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
