    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whitebird soils are on level to strongly sloping uplands.  Slope gradients commonly are 1 to 9 percent but range from 0 to 15 percent.  The soils formed in residuum weathered from alkaline soft sandstone.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 13 to 17 inches.  Most of the precipitation comes in the spring and summer."

Desart, Ekalaka and Lakota soils are on nearby foot slopes, swales and terraces.  Evridge soils are on positions similar to Whitebird soils.  Desart, Ekalaka and Evridge soils do not have visible gypsum or salt crystals within depths of 16 inches. Dogtooth and Janesburg soils are on positions similar to Whitebird soils.  They are fine.  Flasher, Parshall, Telfer and Vebar soils are on nearby uplands.  They do not have natric horizons."
