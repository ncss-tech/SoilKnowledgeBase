  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitebird series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable, sodic soils formed in residuum weathered from soft sandstone. These soils are on uplands and have slope ranging from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches.",
