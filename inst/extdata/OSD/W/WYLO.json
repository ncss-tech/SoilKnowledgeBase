  "OVERVIEW": "The Wylo series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt.  Wylo soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",
