  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wylo soils are on hills, mountains, and plateaus.  They typically occur on all slope positions.  These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from basalt.  Slopes are 2 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 2,100 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm, the mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
