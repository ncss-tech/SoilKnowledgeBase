  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 25 to 45 inches. The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches. The soil typically contains calcium carbonate at the surface, but in places where native grass is the ground cover some pedons are leached to depths of 6 inches. Electrical conductivity of the saturation extract ranges from 1 to 4 mmhos/cm in the upper 6 inches, and 4 to 8 mmhos/cm below depths of 6 inches. The soil contains up to 5 percent by volume of pebbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2. It typically is silt loam, but is loam or silty clay loam in some pedons. It ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically has few or common distinct redoximorphic features in the lower part. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It contains from about 16 to 35 percent calcium carbonate equivalent and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Secondary calcium carbonate occurs as few to many, fine or medium accumulations. Gypsum occurs as few or common nests and crystals in most pedons. Faint mottles are in the B horizon, but distinct or prominent redoximorphic features typically are below depths of 18 inches.\nThe C horizons have hue to 2.5Y or 5Y, value to 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4. Redoximorphic features range from few to many, fine or medium, distinct or prominent. The C horizons typically are silt loam or silty clay loam, but are sandy loam, loam, and clay loam below depths of 40 inches in some pedons. They are slightly or moderately alkaline. Some pedons do not have accumulations of gypsum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wakonda soils are on nearly level to gently undulating silty mantled glacial till plains. They are on slight convex rises on flats and on the convex to plain side slopes surrounding depressions. Slopes are short with gradients of less than 3 percent. The soil formed in silty sediments derived from loess or silty glacial drift. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Chancellor, Egan, Moody, Nora, Tetonka, Trent, Viborg, Wentworth, Whitewood, and Worthing soils. All of these soils do not have a calcic horizon near the surface. In addition, Chancellor soils are fine textured and are in nearby swales. Egan, Moody, Nora, and Wentworth soils are well drained and are on nearby higher positions. Tetonka soils have E horizons and argillic horizons and are in depressions. Trent, Viborg, and Whitewood soils have thick mollic epipedons and are in swales and concave positions. Worthing soils are fine, have argillic horizons, and are in depressions."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Surface runoff is low. Permeability is moderate. Subsoil drainage is affected by the capillary rise of water from a seasonal water table at 1.5 to 2.5 feet which concentrates lime, gypsum, and other salts in the B horizons."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas are used to grow corn, soybeans, small grain, and alfalfa. Principal native grasses are big bluestem, indiangrass, little bluestem, needlegrasses, and sedges."

The change in classification was based on an MLRA correlation.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
