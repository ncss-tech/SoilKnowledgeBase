Briggsville, Eldean, Lamoille, Newnata, Paintcreek, Upshur, and Woodsfield soils do not have a paralithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Chrome and Redbrush soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches). Edenton soils have a loess mantle that is less than 25 cm (10 inches) thick."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wynn soils are on areas of Late Wisconsin glaciation, typically on terrain of relatively higher elevation with bedrock controlled topography. Slope ranges from 1 to 50 percent. The soils formed in 25 to 56 cm (10 to 22 inches) of loess and in the underlying layer of weathered till overlying interbedded calcareous shale and thin strata of limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 940 to 1067 mm (37 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from about 11 to 13 degrees C (52 to 55 degrees F)."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Eden, Dana, Miamian, Russell, and Xenia soils. Eden soils are on steeper dissected areas. Dana, Miamian, Russell, and Xenia soils all are on lower elevations not controlled by bedrock and broad interfluves that have thicker till deposits. They lack the interbedded shale and limestone within 102 cm (40 inches), and Dana soils also have a mollic epipedon."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most of the Wynn soils are cultivated. Principal crops are corn, soybeans, small grains, alfalfa, and grasses. Many of the more sloping, moderately to severely eroded areas are reverting to brushy pasture or forest. Hawthorn and osageorange brush, and bluegrass are in the more open pastured areas. Native vegetation is hardwood forest."
