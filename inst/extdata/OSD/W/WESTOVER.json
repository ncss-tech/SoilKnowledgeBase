  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Typically free carbonates are at the surface but are lacking in the upper 2 or 3 inches in some pedons.  Reaction throughout the soil is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Depth to the 2C horizon typically is about 30 to 34 inches and ranges from 22 to 49 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or silt loam.  Few fine soft accumulations of carbonate are in some pedons.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or very fine sandy loam.\nThe 2C horizon is multicolored.  It is loamy sand, gravelly loamy sand or gravel sand.  Thin strata of finer textures are in some pedons."

Murdo soils have an argillic horizon and have sand and gravel between depths of 12 and 20 inches. Orton soils have a mollic epipedon.  Ree soils have a mollic epipedon and argillic horizon.  Sansarc soils are clayey and have bedded shale within depths of 20 inches.  Schamber soils have coarse sand and gravel at shallower depths.  Lowry and Ree soils are on nearly level to gently sloping adjacent landscapes.  Orton, Murdo, Schamber, and Sully soils are on similar landscapes.  Sansarc soils are below areas of Westover soils in adjacent landscapes. Sully soils are coarse-silty."
