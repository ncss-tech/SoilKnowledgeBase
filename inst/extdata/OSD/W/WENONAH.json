  "STATES": "NY",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wenonah series consist of very deep, well drained, loamy soils on flood plains. These soils formed in alluvium derived from glacial drift containing sandstone, siltstone and shale. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 40 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 16 to 45 inches. Bedrock is deeper than 60 inches. Rock fragments, mainly gravel, cobbles and channers, range from 0 to 15 percent in the surface layer and subsoil and from 0 to 50 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid in the mineral solum, unless limed, and from very strongly acid through neutral in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 through 4. Dry color value is 6 or more. Texture is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, granular or subangular blocky structure. It is friable or very friable.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture is silt loam, loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sand loam, or loamy very fine sand. Structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky or granular. Consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon with textures similar to the B horizon or ranging to fine sand. This horizon is massive or single grain, and consistence is friable, very friable or loose.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 5. Texture ranges from loam or fine sandy loam to loamy sand or fine sand in the fine earth fraction and is stratified in some pedons. Redoximorphic features may or may not be present. It is massive or single grain. Consistence is friable through loose."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The McNulty and Occum series are in the same family. McNulty soils average more than 60 inches of precipitation per year. Occum soils formed in alluvium derived from glacial drift that contains gneiss, granite and schist and has rock fragments of these types in the lower part of the series control section. Also, Occum soils typically have a coarse textured substratum.\nThe Barbour, Hamlin, Hamplain, Tioga and Wappinger series are similar soils in related families. Barbour soils have a coarse-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal family particle size control section. Hamlin and Hamplain soils have a coarse silty particle size control section. Tioga and Wappinger soils have more than 60 percent base saturation."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wenonah soils are nearly level soils on flood plains including high bottoms. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in post glacial alluvium derived from glacial drift having a high content of sandstone, siltstone and shale. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 51 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 48 inches, and the mean annual frost-free season ranges from 120 to 170 days. The elevation of these soils is 200 to 1500 feet."

Moderately well drained Otego soils, somewhat poorly drained Holderton soils, and poorly drained Wayland soils are drainage associates on nearby flood plains. Gravelly Chenango soils are on nearby glacial outwash terraces. Trestle soils are on adjacent flood plains and have a very gravelly subsoil. Raynham, Unadilla, Wallington and Williamson soils are on nearby terraces and lake plains. These soils formed in silty deposits. Valois soils are along adjacent lower valley sides in till deposits."

    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Wenonah soils are mostly cultivated. Corn and hay are the principal crops. Some areas, particularly those that flood more frequently, are in woodlots or in brush and weedy abandoned fields. Sugar maple, northern red oak, American beech, black cherry, and white ash are species common to woodlots."
