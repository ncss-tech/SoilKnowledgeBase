  "OVERVIEW": "The Wellesley series consists of deep to dense glacial till, moderately well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from an admixture of alpine and continental glacial till on glacial valleys.  Slopes are 30 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 50 inches and average annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",
