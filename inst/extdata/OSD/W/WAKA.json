  "OVERVIEW": "The Waka series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in silty and loamy alluvium of Holocene age.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping draws in the Southern High Plains, Northern part (MLRA 77A).  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 13 degrees C (55 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm (18 in).",
