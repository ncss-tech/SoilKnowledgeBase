  "REVDATE": "07/2011",
  "STATES": "NY,PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Williamson series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils on lake plains and uplands. They are nearly level to sloping soils formed in silty or very fine sandy lacustrine or eolian deposits. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow or very slow in the fragipan. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 50 degrees F., mean annual precipitation from 28 to 40 inches and mean growing seasons from 140 to 180 days.",

Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent throughout the soil. Unless limed, soil reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the solum and strongly acid to neutral in the substratum.\nThe Ap  or A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is fine sandy loam to silt loam. The Ap horizon has weak to moderate granular or subangular blocky structure and friable or very friable consistence. Thickness of the A horizon is 2 to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 through 6 and may have faint redoximorphic features above 12 inches. It is very fine sandy loam or silt loam. The Bw horizon has very weak, weak, or moderate granular, angular blocky, or subangular blocky structure and friable or very friable consistence.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 and chroma of 2 to 4 and few through many, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. It is massive or has weak or moderate, thin or medium platy structure.\nThe Bx horizon has hues of 5YR through 2.5Y, values of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4 and few or common, medium or coarse, faint through prominent redoximorphic features. Prisms are separated by materials like that in the E horizon. The Bx horizon is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. It is massive or it has weak or moderate very coarse prismatic structure and parts to platy structure in some pedons. It is firm or very firm and brittle.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam and is commonly stratified. Some pedons have loamy very fine sand below depths of 40 inches. The C horizon is massive or has plate like divisions inherited from depositional layers. Soil reaction increases as depth increases."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Amboy and Canaseraga soils are members of the same family. Amboy soils lack common distinct to prominent redoximorphic features above 24 inches. Canaseraga soils have a lithologic discontinuity with 10 to 40 percent coarse fragments below the discontinuity.\nSimilar soils in related families are the Allard, Scio, and Unadilla, all of which lack fragipans, and Rushford soils. Rushford soils have coarse-loamy particle-size control section with rock fragments from 15 to 35 percent allowed in the surface and upper subsoil layers."

Other associated soils are the Arkport, Bath, Collamer, Colonie, Dunkirk, Hudson, Mardin, and Rhinebeck. Arkport and Colonie are on similar landforms but contain more sand and lack fragipans. Bath and Mardin soils, associated on uplands, formed in glacial till deposits. Collamer, Dunkirk, Hudson and Rhinebeck soils are associated on lake plains and all have argillic horizons and lack fragipans. In addition Hudson and Rhinebeck soils formed in deep clayey lacustrine deposits."
