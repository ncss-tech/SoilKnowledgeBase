  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to carbonates ranges from 4 to 12 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  The control section is clay loam or clay and averages 35 to 50 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  The soils are dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., which occurs about April 21-27, and is dry in all parts of the moisture control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25 and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean soil temperature is 47 to 53 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days. Channers range from 0 to 15 percent, are typically less than 5 percent, and break down with pretreatment.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, clay loam, fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma is 2 to 4.  Texture is clay or clay loam.  Reaction is neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe Btk, when present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma is 2 to 4.  Texture is clay or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 3 to 12 percent.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 5 or 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Texture is clay or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 5 to 14 percent."

The soils formed in alluvium and residuum weathered from calcareous shales and argillaceous sandstone.  Elevation is 3,500 to 6,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 13 inches with over half of the annual precipitation falling in April, May, and June and less than one inch falling in each month of July, August, September, and October.  Precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 44 to 51 degrees F.  The frost-free period is about 150 to 130 days."
