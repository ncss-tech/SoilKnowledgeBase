    "content": "REMARKS: Wate soils were formerly included with the Wahee or Warne series. The central concept of the Wahee series is in the Tidewater MLRA (153B) and the Warne series in the MLRA 133A and 136 (thermic). Wate soils are in a drainage catena of Danripple (well drained), Banister (moderately well drained), Wate (somewhat poorly drained), and Kinkora (poorly drained) soils.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to 11 inches (A and E horizons)\nAlbic horizon--the zone from 5 to 11 inches (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 11 to 38 inches (Btg1 and Btg2 horizons)\nEndosaturation--saturation in all layers to a depth of 80 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA: None\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSoil Name   Slope   Airtemp   FrFr/Seas   Precip   Elevation\nWATE        0-8     52-57     165-205     38-54    300-1600\nSoil Name   FloodL  FloodH     Watertable   Kind      Months    Bedrock\nWATE        OCCAS   VERY RARE  1.0-1.5      APPARENT  DEC-MAR   >80\nSoil Name   Depth    Texture       3-Inch   No-10    Clay%   -CEC-\nWATE        0-11     SL FSL        0-0     95-100    5-20     2-6\nWATE        0-11     L SIL VFSL    0-0    100-100   10-27     3-10\nWATE       11-38     C CL SIC      0-0    100-100   35-70     8-20\nWATE       38-80     VAR\nSoil Name   Depth    -pH-      O.M.
