  "OVERVIEW": "The Wixom series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in sandy material and the underlying loamy till or lacustrine deposits on till plains, outwash plains, and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 6 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 920 mm, and mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
