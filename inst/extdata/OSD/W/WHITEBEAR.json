  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitebear series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on lake terraces, flood plains and alluvial fans.  These soils formed in mixed lacustrine sediments.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F and the average annual precipitation is about 17 inches.",
