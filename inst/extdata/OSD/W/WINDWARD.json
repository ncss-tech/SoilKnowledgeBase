  "REVDATE": "04/2009",
  "STATES": "WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Windward series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in eolian sand.  These soils are on toeslopes and footslopes of hills.  Permeability is rapid in the sandy part and moderately rapid or rapid in lamellae.  Slope ranges from 2 to 12 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: The zone from 0 to 9 inches;\nLamellic: Lamellae with total thickness of less than 6 inches in the series control section;\nSiliceous feature: Less than 10 percent weatherable minerals (0.02 to 2mm fraction) in the particle-size control section;\ncoated feature - the weighted average content more than 5 percent silt plus clay in the particle-size control section.\nParent material is considered to be eolian sand that has subsequently moved downslope as alluvium.  The lamellae are believed to have formed as a result of periodic deposition of fines from nearby loess covered hills.  This series is similar to the Drammen series except the source of the sand is from the local weathered sandstone and the lamellae are less than 6 inches thick in the particle-size control section.\nOnly series status, responsibility, and scrivener's errors changed - 4/09."
