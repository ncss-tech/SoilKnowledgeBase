  "OVERVIEW": "The Westsum series consists of very deep, well drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in residual material weathered from gray Permian shale. These very gently sloping to gently sloping soils are on lower hillslopes on uplands in the Central Rolling Red Plains (MLRA 80A).  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 32 inches.",
