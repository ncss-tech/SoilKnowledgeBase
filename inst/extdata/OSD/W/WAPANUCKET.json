  "STATES": "MA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wapanucket series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils on glacial lake plains, terraces, and glacial outwash landforms. The soils formed in sandy glaciofluvial or eolian deposits underlain by loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high or very high in the solum and upper substratum and moderately low or moderately high in the lower substratum. Slope ranges from 0 through 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation is about 1143 mm.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum ranges from 33 through 97 cm. The depth to the lithologic discontinuity or the lacustrine sediments ranges from 101 through 152 cm. Rock fragments are dominantly gravel and range from 0 through 30 percent by volume with up to 5 percent cobbles within the outwash or eolian component. The lacustrine sediments generally lack rock fragments. Depth to bedrock is more than 160 cm. Redoximorphic features, if present, are immediately above or within the 2C layer.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture in the fine earth fraction is loamy sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. It has weak or moderate granular structure, or is massive. Consistence is very friable or friable. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through strongly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. Texture in the fine earth fraction is loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Structure is subangular blocky or the horizon is massive or single grain. Consistence is very friable, friable, or loose. Reaction ranges from strongly acid through neutral.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon similar to the Bw horizon.\nThe C layer has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture in the fine earth fraction is sand, coarse sand, or loamy sand. The horizon is single grain and consistence is loose. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through slightly acid.\nThe 2C layer has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is silt, silt loam, or very fine sandy loam. Some pedons have sub layers of loamy very fine sand. Some pedons contain thin strata and lenses of fine sand, very fine sand, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand, and sand. The horizon has depositional plates or is massive. Consistence is very friable, friable, or firm. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through very strongly acid."

Acquango, Aldo, Caesar, Chute, Oakville, Osolo, Pahuk, Penwood, Plainfield, Samoa, and Tyner soils have C layers lacking loamy material; having sand content of 70 percent or more throughout. Bigapple and Breeze (T) soils formed in anthrotransported material, and have C layers lacking loamy material; having sand content of 70 percent or more throughout. Biltmore soils formed in alluvium and are subject to flooding. Boplain soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact. Dabney, Hodge, Perks, Ronda, Sardak, Sarpy, Scotah, and Suncook soils formed in alluvium, are subjected to flooding unless protected, and have C layers lacking loamy material; having sand content of 70 percent or more throughout. The competing North Shore series name is reserved but the Official Series Description is not posted. Pinegrove soils lack a B horizon and have regolith fragments of sandstone from surface mine spoil. Poquonock soils have a densic contact within a depth of 50 through 96 cm. Spessard soils formed in colluvium, and have C layers lacking loamy material; having sand content of 70 percent or more throughout."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wapanucket soils are nearly level through steep soils on glacial lake plains, terraces, and glaciofluvial landforms. Slope ranges from 0 through 25 percent. The steeper slopes are typically on terrace risers. The soils formed in eolian or outwash sands derived mainly from crystalline rocks underlain by loamy glaciolacustrine deposits. Mean annual temperature ranges from 6 through 12 degrees C., mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 through 1220 mm, and the growing season ranges from 120 through 190 days. Frost free days range from 145 through 240."

The Carver, Deerfield, Mashpee, Massasoit, Merrimac, Wareham, and Windsor soils are not underlain by loamy materials. Raynham and Scio soils contain less sand in the solum and formed in lacustrine deposits."
