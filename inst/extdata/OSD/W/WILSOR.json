These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from tuff with a component of loess and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 4 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 1,680 to 1,985 meters.  Climate is cool and semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 250 to 300 mm; the average annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C.; and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
