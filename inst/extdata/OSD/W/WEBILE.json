  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kingile and Lanexa soils.  Kingile soils have fine textured mineral horizons at depths of 43 to 91 centimeters (17 to 36 inches).  Lanexa soils are formed in fresh to slightly brackish water marshes along rivers and creeks of the Atlantic Coastal Plain. They also have thin lenses and strata of mineral soil material in the control section, moderate permeability in the organic layer and a salinity of 4 to 8 dS/m in the upper part of the profile."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Webile soils are in fresh water marshes and river channels of the San Joaquin-Sacramento Delta.  Slopes are less than 2 percent.  The soils formed in hydrophytic plant remains over fine textured mixed mineral alluvium.  The organic material is derived from tule and reed fibers.  Elevations are at sea level to 4.5 meters (15 feet) below sea level on islands protected by levees and on nearly level river deltas.  The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 305 to 407 millimeters (12 to 16 inches).  Mean January temperature is about 7 degrees C (45 degrees F); mean July temperature is about 24 degrees C (75 degrees F); mean annual temperature is about 16 degrees C (60 to 61 degrees F).  Frost-free period ranges from 250 to 300 days."

Egbert and Peltier soils are mineral soils that have a fine particle size control section.  Rindge soils have continuous sapric organic material to a depth of 130 centimeters (51 inches) or more.  Ryde soils are mineral soils that are fine-loamy.  Shinkee soils are organic soils with loamy mineral material below 50 to 91 centimeters (20 to 35 inches)."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Very poorly drained; very slow runoff; rapid permeability in the organic material and slow permeability in the underlying mineral material.  The water table is lowered by artificial drainage with open drains and pumps.  The water table is usually at a depth of 91 to 152 centimeters (3 to 5 feet) during the growing season and at or near the surface at some time during the winter.  Areas that are used for annual crops are flooded during the winter months."
