  "OVERVIEW": "The Wibaux series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from porcelanite.  Wibaux soils are on hillslopes, knolls and ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the fragmental substrata ranges from 7 to 20 inches.  These soils typically are noncalcareous throughout the loamy-skeletal part of the control section but some pedons have carbonates within 6 inches.  The fragmental materials in some pedons are inconsistently calcareous.  The weighted average organic carbon content of the surface 15 inches or that portion of the solum above the fragmental beds ranges from approximately 0.4 to 1.0 percent.  Conductivity is typically less than 2 mmhos/cm and exchangeable sodium percentage is normally less than 3 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soil temperature at 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or higher for 175 to 210 days.  The fragmental material contains interstices ranging from 2 mm to over 2 cm in diameter.  These are devoid of any fine earth material.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 6.  When the value of the A horizon is as dark as 5 and 3 moist, the horizon is too thin or contains too little organic matter to be a mollic epipedon.  Texture is loam or fine sandy loam, or channery or very channery analogues of these textures.  Rock fragments range from 5 to 40 percent, with 0 to 5 percent flagstone.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have an AC horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 7 and 3 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Texture is very channery or extremely channery loam or fine sandy loam.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 90 percent,  with 0 to 15 percent flagstones and 0 to 5 percent stones.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.  Moderately alkaline reactions may occur where baked shale is sodic.\nThe 2C horizon consists of fractured and/or folded porcelanite beds.  A soil matrix is uncommon but when present is less than 5 percent.  Colors of the rock are quite variable but commonly have 10R or 2.5YR hue.  Hues of 5Y have been recorded in some areas."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wibaux series occurs on hillslopes, knolls and the crests and shoulders of ridges.  Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent.  The soil is developing in thin mantels of medium to moderately fine textured, noncalcareous, channery materials weathered principally from porcelanite beds.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches with peak periods of precipitation occurring in April, May and June.  The mean annual temperature is 46 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 65 degrees F.  Elevation is 3,500\tto 5,800 feet.  The frost-free season is 105 to 130 days."

They have argillic horizons.  Shingle, Taluce, Theedle and Turnercrest occur on similar landscape positions as Wibaux soils lack fragmental discontinuities.  Redhills soils are moderately deep to fractured porcelanite."
