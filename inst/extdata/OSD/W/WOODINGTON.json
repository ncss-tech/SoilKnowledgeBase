Some pedons contain a few fine flakes of mica.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or it is neutral, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon, has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Some pedons have mottles in shades of brown or yellow.  Textures range the same as the surface horizon.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or it is neutral, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2.  Mottles in shades of brown, yellow, and red are in most pedons.  Texture is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Silt content ranges from 5 to 30 percent.\nThe Cg horizon is in shades of gray, brown, and yellow or is mottled in these colors.  The texture is loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.  Thin strata of these textures are in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The competing series are Bayou and Smithton in the same family.  Similar soils in related families include Atmore, Fallsington, Pactolus, Plummer, Rains, Stallings, Torhunta, and Weston series.  Bayou soils contain more than 18 percent clay in lower Btg, and are more compacted.  Smithton soils contain more than 30 percent silt.  Atmore soils have more than 5 percent plinthite within 60 inches of the surface and, contain more silt.  Fallsington and Rains soils have more than 18 percent clay in the control section and Fallsington soils are mesic.  Pactolus soils are sandy, lack argillic horizons, and have better drainage.  Plummer soils have grossarenic epipedons and loamy Bt horizons.  Stallings soils have colors of chroma 3 or more in the upper Bt horizon.  Torhunta soils have umbric epipedons.  Weston soils have solum thickness less than 60 inches."
