The solum ranges from 20 to 36 inches thick.  The particle-size control section is silt loam or silty clay loam and averages about 20 to 30 percent clay.  Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 2 moist and dry.  Redox features are none to common and faint to distinct.\nThe B horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  Redox features are distinct or prominent.\nThe C horizon commonly is silty clay loam but is stratified with sand or clay in some pedons."

Average January temperature is 35 degrees F., average July temperature is 68 degrees F., and mean annual temperature is 52 to 54 degrees F.  Mean annual rainfall is 50 to 60 inches.
