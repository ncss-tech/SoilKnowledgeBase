  "STATES": "NM,TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wessly series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium.  These nearly level to gently sloping soils are on depressions on alluvial flats on basin floors.  Slope ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
