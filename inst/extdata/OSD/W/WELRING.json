  "OVERVIEW": "The Welring series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone with influence from quartzite or sandstone.  Welring soils are on mountain sideslopes and toeslopes.  Slopes are 3 to 80 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 360 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
