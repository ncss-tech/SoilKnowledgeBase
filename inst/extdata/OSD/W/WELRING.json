These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone, quartzite and sandstone.  Elevations range from 1,405 to 2,200 meters. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 300 to 400 mm.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C.  The frost free period is 90 to 160 days."
