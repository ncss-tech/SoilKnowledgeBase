  "OVERVIEW": "The Walkon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in material derived from sandstone and shale.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Walkon soils are on undulating plateaus and hillslopes.  Slope ranges from 1 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F.",
