  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wolfeson series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in glaciofluvial material and glaciolacustrine deposits with an influence of volcanic ash and loess in the upper part. Wolfeson soils are on glacial outwash terraces and relict glacial lake terraces. Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

Bridgeson soils are fine loamy, poorly drained, and occur in drainageways. Peone soils are ashy with glassy mineralogy, poorly drained, and occur on alluvial fans, drainageways, and depressional areas. Stapaloop soils are well drained and occur on terraces and footslopes and toeslopes of foothills."

    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and other features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 9 inches. (Ap horizon)\nCambic horizon - The zone from 9 to 37 inches. (Bw1, and Bw2 horizons)\nParticle size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches. (Part of the Bw1, Bw2, and part of the C1 horizon)\nVitrandic feature -- The zone from 0 to 21 inches (A and Bw1 horizons)\nOxyaquic feature -- The zone beginning at 21 inches having saturation with water for 30 or more cumulative days.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nAreas of Wolfeson soils were previously mapped with a mesic soil temperature regime in Stevens County and northern Spokane County, Washington. As of 8/2011 the Wolfeson series has been investigated over it's entire extent by the MLRA SSO Leader from Spokane, WA and has been determined to have a frigid soil temperature regime based on natural vegetation.\nThe 8/2011 posting reflects a redescription of the type location pedon and a change in classification from Coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Aquic Haploxerepts to Coarse-loamy, isotic, frigid Oxyaquic Vitrandic Haploxerepts.\nFurther investigation is needed to determine typical mineralogy (isotic vs. mixed).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
