  "OVERVIEW": "The Whittell series consists of moderately deep, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum derived from granodiorite. The Whittell soils are on the upper third of mountainflanks. Slopes range from 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 2 degrees C.",

The Canlodore, Castelpeak, Chena, Cryomont, Eklutna, Nataga, Nizina, Obscurity, Perfecto, Sofgran, and Studebaker soils are greater than 150 cm deep to bedrock. Graylock is 100 to 150 cm deep to bedrock, Jobsis is less than 50 cm deep to bedrock. Of the three soils with bedrock at 50 to 100 cm, Alflack is formed in sandstone with coarse fragments consisting of channers and flagstones; Stecum is formed in micaceous granite and gneiss on foothills with a soil temperature of 5.5 to 8 degrees centigrade and Freelpeak lacks the O horizons and has a C horizon on the surface."

The climate is subhumid-continental with cool, dry summers and cold, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 889 to 1,397 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 1 to 3 degrees C.
