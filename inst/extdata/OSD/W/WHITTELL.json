The Canlodore, Castelpeak, Chena, Cryomont, Eklutna, Nataga, Nizina, Obscurity, Perfecto, Sofgran, and Studebaker soils are greater than 150 cm deep to bedrock. Graylock is 100 to 150 cm deep to bedrock, Jobsis is less than 50 cm deep to bedrock. Of the three soils with bedrock at 50 to 100 cm, Alflack is formed in sandstone with coarse fragments consisting of channers and flagstones; Stecum is formed in micaceous granite and gneiss on foothills with a soil temperature of 5.5 to 8 degrees centigrade and Freelpeak lacks the O horizons and has a C horizon on the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Whittell soils are in the high mountain areas in and around the Tahoe Basin. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. These soils formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from granodiorite on the upper third of mountainflank. Elevation is 2415 to 3270 meters. The climate is subhumid-continental with cool, dry summers and cold, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 889 to 1,397 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 1 to 3 degrees C. Frost free season is less than 45 days."
