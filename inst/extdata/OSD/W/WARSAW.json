  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Warsaw soils are on outwash plains, stream terraces, kames, and valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Warsaw soils formed in loamy sediments and in the underlying gravelly outwash over calcareous, stratified gravelly or very gravelly coarse sand and sand. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 762 to 1067 mm (30 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 11.7 degrees C (48 to 53 degrees F). Elevation is 177 to 466 meters (580 feet to 1530 feet) above mean sea level."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: The well drained Elston and Wea soils, the somewhat excessively drained Ade soils, the excessively drained Rodman soils, and the poorly drained or very poorly drained Westland soils are closely associated with the Warsaw soils. Elston soils have less clay in the subsoil and are on adjacent nearly level or gently sloping areas. Rodman soils are on the breaks and steeper ridges and contain more sand. Westland soils are in the lower flats and depressions. Ade soils are closely associated with Warsaw in areas where there are small sandy ridges and contain less clay throughout the profile. Warsaw soils grade to Wea soils where the solum is more than 102 cm (40 inches) thick on similar landscape positions."
