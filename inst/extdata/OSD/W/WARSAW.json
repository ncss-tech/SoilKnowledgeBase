  "OVERVIEW": "The Warsaw series consists of well drained soils formed in loamy sediments and in the underlying gravelly outwash on outwash plains, terraces, kames, and valley trains. These are very deep soils that are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified gravelly or very gravelly coarse sand and sand. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 11.1 degrees C (52 degrees F).",

Elston soils have less clay in the subsoil and are on adjacent nearly level or gently sloping areas. Rodman soils are on the breaks and steeper ridges and contain more sand. Westland soils are in the lower flats and depressions. Ade soils are closely associated with Warsaw in areas where there are small sandy ridges and contain less clay throughout the profile. Warsaw soils grade to Wea soils where the solum is more than 102 cm (40 inches) thick on similar landscape positions."
