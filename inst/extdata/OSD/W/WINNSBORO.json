Conasauga and Talbott soils have bedrock at less than 40 inches. Iredell soils have iron depletions in the lower subsoil. Mimosa soils formed in phosphatic limestone and are higher in content of phosphorous. In addition, the depth to hard limestone ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Colbert and Orange soils have smectitic mineralogy. Enon and Mecklenburg soils have a depth to bedrock of greater than 60 inches.
