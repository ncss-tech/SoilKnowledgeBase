Content of coarse fragments ranges from 0 to 50 percent in the A and E horizons and 0 to 35 percent in the Bt, BC and C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.\nThe EB horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6.

    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Archer, Bradyville, Conasauga, Mimosa, Talbott, and Wynott series in the same family, and the Colbert, Enon, Iredell, Mecklenburg, Orange, and Wilkes soils in related families. Archer soils have mottles in all parts of the argillic horizon and have limestone bedrock between 38 and 54 inches. Bradyville soils have red or yellowish red B horizons. Conasauga and Talbott soils have bedrock at less than 40 inches. Iredell soils have iron depletions in the lower subsoil. Mimosa soils formed in phosphatic limestone and are higher in content of phosphorous. In addition, the depth to hard limestone ranges from 40 to 60 inches. Colbert and Orange soils have smectitic mineralogy. Enon and Mecklenburg soils have a depth to bedrock of greater than 60 inches. Wilkes soils have a paralithic contact at depths of less than 20 inches. Wynott soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches."
