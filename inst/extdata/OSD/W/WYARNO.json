  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyarno series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in fine textured, calcareous alluvium derived dominantly from shale.  Wyarno soils are on fan remnants, fan piedmonts, alluvial fans and hills.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
