  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. Series in similar families are the Fonda, Holly, Orrville, Scitico, Stanhope, Toledo, and Wilhite series. Fonda, Scitico, and Toledo soils do not have an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth or have 0.2 percent organic carbon at a depth of 125 centimeters. Holly, Orrville, and Stanhope soils have less than 35 percent clay and mixed mineralogy in the particle-size control section. Wilhite soils have mixed mineralogy in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wabasha soils are on flood plains or in depressions along low-gradient streams receiving sediment from areas of Wisconsinan age glaciation. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The soils formed in clayey alluvium washed mainly from areas of loamy, calcareous glaciolacustrine sediments or till. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 686 to 1067 mm (27 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 13 degrees C (45 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free period is 140 to 180 days. Elevation is 175 to 244 meters (575 to 800 feet) above mean sea level."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Defiance, Fulton, Hoytville, Latty, Lucas, Nappanee, Paulding, Roselms, St. Clair, and Toledo soils. The somewhat poorly drained Defiance soils do not have a dark surface layer and are on slightly higher positions on flood plains. The Fulton, Hoytville, Latty, Lucas, Nappanee, Paulding, Roselms, St. Clair, and Toledo soils are on nearby lake plains."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained or poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between December and June in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible to low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately low. Permeability is slow. These soils are subject to frequent flooding from January to May."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most Wabasha soils are cultivated and used primarily for growing corn and soybeans. Some areas are in pasture, and a small acreage is used for woodland. Native vegetation is swamp forest dominated by water tolerant hardwoods such as elm, cottonwood, sycamore, and silver maple."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon (mollic intergrade): from the surface to a depth of 18 cm (Ap horizon).\nCambic horizon: from a depth of 18 to 122 cm (Bg horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox features visible in all horizons below a depth of 18 cm.\nWabasha series was formerly classified as Mollic Fluvaquents. All pedons published in soil survey reports in MLRAs 99 and 111B classify as Fluvaquentic Endoaquepts.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Laboratory characterization data is available from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory for pedons DF-28, OT-8, and PD-56. This data should be evaluated in the future to determine if it supports the current series concept.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
