  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodstock series consists of somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in loamy till on bedrock controlled, glaciated uplands.  They are shallow to schist, granite, or gneiss bedrock.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high.  Slope ranges from 0 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 43 inches and mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to bedrock ranges from 10 to 20 inches. Rock fragments, predominantly gravel, range from 5 to 35 percent throughout the soil.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid to slightly acid.\nThe A, or Ap horizon, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.  Structure is commonly weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular and consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin, discontinuous E horizon.\nThe upper part of the Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  The lower part has colors similar to the upper part but includes hue of 2.5Y.  Texture is fine sandy loam or sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.  Structure is weak or moderate, very fine to medium granular or subangular blocky and consistence is friable or very friable.\nSome pedons have a thin BC horizon with properties similar to the lower part of the Bw horizon\nSome pedons have a C horizon that has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 to 3.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy fine sand or their gravelly analogues.  Structure is weak, very fine or fine granular or is single grain or massive. Consistence ranges from friable to firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Barto, Hawksnest, Insula, Irona, and Westminster series.   Barto and Insula soils are from outside of Region R.  They both have rock fragments that are mainly gabbro or granite.  Hawksnest soils have rock fragments that are mainly sandstone, siltstone, or shale.  Irona soils have rock fragments that are mainly sandstone or granite.  Westminster soils have rock fragments that are mainly dark colored schist and are mapped primarily in areas with dark colored schist bedrock."

The soils formed in friable till derived mainly from light colored schist, granite, or gneiss.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 50 inches and the mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit. The frost free season ranges from 90 to 135 days. Elevation ranges from 300 to 2000 feet above mean sea level."

Woodstock soils were previously classified as Entic Lithic Haplorthods.\n3.  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na.  Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 2 inches (Oe and A horizons).\nb.  Cambic horizon - the zone from 2 to 11 inches  (Bw horizon).\nc.  Lithic feature - Bedrock at 11 inches."
