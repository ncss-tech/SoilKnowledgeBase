  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The clayey part of the Bt horizon ranges from 10 to 40 inches thick. Depth to soft bedrock is 40 to 60 inches. The soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid except where the surface has been limed. Dark manganese oxide concretions range from none to common throughout the profile. Pebbles of siltstone and mudstone range from 0 to 10 percent by volume throughout.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 10R, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam or silt loam. In eroded areas, the Ap horizon is clay loam.\nThe BA horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR to 10R, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam or silt loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10R, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons contain mottles in shades of yellow, brown, or red. The texture is clay, silty clay, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 10R, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 3 to 6. Some pedons may contain mottles in shades of yellow, brown, gray, or red. The texture is clay loam or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10R, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 6. Some pedons contain mottles in shades of yellow, brown, gray, or red. It is silt loam or loam saprolite of mudstone, siltstone, sandstone, shale, or conglomerate.\nThe Cr horizon is similar in color to the C horizon and is weathered moderately hard siltstone, mudstone, sandstone, shale, or conglomerate. Some pedons may have hard unweathered bedrock below 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in the same family. Exway, Coronaca, Davidson, Hiwassee, and Lloyd soils are in closely related families. Exway soils are active. Coronaca, Davidson, Hiwassee, and Lloyd soils have kaolinitic mineralogy. In addition, Coronaca and Davidson soils do not have a 20 percent decrease in content of clay from the maximum within 60 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wadesboro soils are on gently sloping to steep Piedmont uplands. Slope gradients dominantly are 8 to 40 percent and range from 2 to 40 percent. They formed in residuum weathered from Triassic fine-grained mudstone, siltstone, shale, sandstone, or conglomerate rocks. Mean annual precipitation is 44 inches and mean annual air temperature is 61 degrees F. near the type location."

None of these soils except Exway are rhodic. The moderately well drained Brickhaven and somewhat poorly drained Carbonton soils lack redox depletions in the upper part of the subsoil.  Creedmoor, Green Level, Polkton, and White Store soils are moderately well drained or somewhat poorly drained and have a high or very high shrink swell potential.  Peakin soils have a water table between 40 and 60 inches.  Pinoka soils are fine-loamy and have a depth to paralithic contact between 20 to 40 inches."

Native tree species include Virginia pine, shortleaf pine, chestnut oak, hickory, post oak, southern and northern white oak, northern red oak, sweetgum, and yellow-poplar. Understory species include dogwood, red maple, redbud, huckleberry, and sassafras. Some acreage is used for hay or improved pasture."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The Wadesboro series was made inactive after 1971. It includes soils previously mapped as Stoneville which is now classified as mesic. The hardness of the Cr horizon tends to fluctuate with soil moisture. It does not slake after being immersed in water for one hour but will disperse with the hexametaphosphate treatment.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSOI-5 Soil Name Slope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas   Precip  Elevation\nNC    WADESBORO  2-40   58-62   180-220     42-50    350-450\nSOI-5 FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind Months Bedrock  Hardness\nNC    NONE           6.0-6.0     -          40-60    SOFT\nSOI-5 Depth Texture    3-Inch  No-10   Clay%   -CEC-\nNC    0- 8  L SIL      0-8     90-100  12-28   2-8\nNC    0- 8  SICL CL    0-8     90-100  27-40   2-8\nNC    8-30  C CL SIC   0-5     95-100  35-60   7-13\nNC   30-41  CL SICL L  0-5     95-100  10-35   2-7\nNC   41-62  WB          -        -       -      -\nSOI-5 Depth  -pH-     O.M.
