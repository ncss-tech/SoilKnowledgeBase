  "OVERVIEW": "The Windynip series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and mudstone. Windynip soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 2160 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 13 degrees C.",
