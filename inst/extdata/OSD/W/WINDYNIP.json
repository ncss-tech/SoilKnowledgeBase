    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Windynip soils are on linear to slightly concave or convex positions on predominantly southeast to southwest-facing ridges and slopes. Slopes are 5 to 50 percent. Elevations are 60 to 1000 meters. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone and mudstone. The climate is subhumid with warm, dry summers with a marine layer influence and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 1525 to 3050 millimeters. The mean annual temperature is 12 to 14 degrees C. Frost free season is about 240 to 280 days."
