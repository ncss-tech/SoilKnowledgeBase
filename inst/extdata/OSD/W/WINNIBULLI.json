  "OVERVIEW": "The Winnibulli series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on alluvial fans and fan terraces.  They formed in alluvium from extrusive igneous rock.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F and the mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.",
