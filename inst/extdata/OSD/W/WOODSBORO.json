  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodsboro series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils that formed in fluviomarine deposits of Pleistocene age.  These nearly level soils are in drainageways on the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 21.1 degrees C (70 degrees F.) and mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 in).",
