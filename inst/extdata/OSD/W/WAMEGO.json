(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nParalithic contact: around 69 centimeters (27 inches). (Cr horizon)\nSome pedons have a loess cap.\n11/2015 BKN Updated intro to current standards. Added in metric units. Added clay content, sand content, and fragments to RIC. Added RIC for AB horizon. Northeast facing, linear, and elevation of 352 meters was added to the typical pedon. Added quadrangle, latitude, longitude, and datum to type location. Changed geographic setting to tabular and added in elevation, precipitation pattern, and FFD. Updated geographically associated soils by adding Clime, Martin, Olmitz and Sogn and deleting Sibleyville. Changed permeability to Ksat. Added LRR and MLRA to distribution and extent. Added particle-size control section and paralithic contact to remarks. Added lab data to additional data.\n07/2020 BKN Added reaction class to Cr horizon.\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy: Twelfth Edition, 2014\nAdditional data: Kansas State University Pedology Laboratory data is available for Pedon IDs 95KS087003s, 04KS103016, 04KS103504, and 04KS103505.
