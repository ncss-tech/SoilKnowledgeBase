Stony phases are recognized.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Some uncultivated pedons have a chroma of 1.  It is silty clay, silty clay loam, clay or clay loam averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.  It is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline, although some uncultivated pedons have neutral reaction.  Some pedons have an AC horizon or ABk.\nThe Bk and By horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  They are silty clay, silty clay loam, clay or clay loam averaging between 35 and 50 percent clay.  They are slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  Some pedons do not have accumulations of carbonates and gypsum in some pedons and do not have Bk or By horizons.\nSome pedons have C horizons above the Cr with colors, textures and reaction similar to the Bk and By horizons."

Mean annual precipitation ranges up to 20 inches in the foothills of the mountains.  The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F."

Amor, Belfield, Morton, Regent, Rhoades, Sen and Vebar soils are on nearby uplands.  These soils are deeper than 20 inches to soft bedrock, have a mollic epipedon, and either a cambic or argillic horizon.  Brandenburg, Flasher and Ringling soils are on nearby surrounding uplands.  Brandenburg and Ringling soils have porcelanite at shallow depths.  Flasher soils are sandy and formed in soft sandstone beds.  Cabba and Moreau soils are on nearby, similar positions as Wayden.  Cabba soils contain less than 35 percent clay.  Moreau soils have a mollic epipedon and are moderately deep to shale."
