Hagenbarth soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section and are very deep.  They are on hills adjacent to Woodcanyon soils.  Halfcircle soils are deep to a paralithic contact and are calcareous in the control section.  Halfcircle soils are on north facing mountains.  Preussrange soils are generally on south facing slopes above Woodcanyon soils and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact."
