  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodcanyon series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from noncalcareous sandstone on hills and mountains.  Permeability is slow.  Woodcanyon soils have slopes of 20 to 50 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 18 inches.  Average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
