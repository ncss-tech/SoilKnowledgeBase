  "OVERVIEW": "The Wagontown series consists of deep, somewhat excessively drained soils.  They formed in colluvium or alluvium from intrusive igneous rocks.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes are 35 to 70 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
