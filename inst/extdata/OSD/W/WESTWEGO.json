  "OVERVIEW": "The Westwego series consist of deep, poorly drained, very slowly\npermeable soils.  They formed in semifluid clayey alluvium and\norganic material that dried and shrank irreversibly in the upper\npart as the result of artificial drainage.  These soils are on\nbroad, drained former swamps along the lower Mississippi River and\nits distributaries.  Slopes range from 0 to 0.5 percent.  These\nsoils are protected from flooding by a system of levees and are\nartificially drained by pumps.",

Reaction of the A, B, and O\nhorizons ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  The C\nhorizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or\n2 or it is N 2/0 through N 4/0.  Texture is clay, silty clay, muck\nclay, or muck.\nThe Bg and Bbg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5BG, 5GY, or 5G,\nvalue of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or it is N 2/0 through N 5/0.  It\nis clay, silty clay, or mucky clay.\nThe Ab horizon, where present, is neutral or it has hue of 10YR or\n5Y; value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  It is clay or mucky clay.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and\nchroma of 1 or 2 or it is N 2/0 or N 3/0.  It is sapric, hermic,\nor fibric.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5G, value of 2 to 5, and chroma\nof 1 or 2.  It is clay or mucky clay.\nCompeting Series:  There are no other known series in this family.\nBarbary, Fausse, Gentilly, and Scatlake are in similar families.\nBarbary and Scatlake soils do not have a firm layer within the\ncontrol section.  Fausse and Gentilly soils have firm underlying\nlayers."

The slightly lower\nlying Allemands soils have organic surface layers 16 to 51 inches\nthick.  Sharkey soils at higher elevations have firm mineral\nlayers throughout the solum.\nDrainage and Permeability:  Westwego soils are poorly drained;\nrunoff is slow and permeability is very slow.  The water table is\nat a depth of 1 to 3 feet and is dependent on the pumping\nprocedures."
