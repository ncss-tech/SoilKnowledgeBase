    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to semifluid layers ranges from\n28 to 40 inches.  Depth to an organic layer more than 8 inches\nthick ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Reaction of the A, B, and O\nhorizons ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.  The C\nhorizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or\n2 or it is N 2/0 through N 4/0.  Texture is clay, silty clay, muck\nclay, or muck.\nThe Bg and Bbg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, 5BG, 5GY, or 5G,\nvalue of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 or it is N 2/0 through N 5/0.  It\nis clay, silty clay, or mucky clay.\nThe Ab horizon, where present, is neutral or it has hue of 10YR or\n5Y; value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1.  It is clay or mucky clay.\nThe O horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and\nchroma of 1 or 2 or it is N 2/0 or N 3/0.  It is sapric, hermic,\nor fibric.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR to 5G, value of 2 to 5, and chroma\nof 1 or 2.  It is clay or mucky clay.\nCompeting Series:  There are no other known series in this family.\nBarbary, Fausse, Gentilly, and Scatlake are in similar families.\nBarbary and Scatlake soils do not have a firm layer within the\ncontrol section.  Fausse and Gentilly soils have firm underlying\nlayers."

The landscape was semifluid clayey\nswamps and swamp-marsh transition prior to reclamation.\nElevations are generally 2 or 3 feet below sea level.  Slope is\nless than 0.5 percent.  Near the type location the average annual\nrainfall is about 65 inches and the mean annual temperature is\nabout 67 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the competing Barbary\nseries and the Allemands and Sharkey series.  The slightly lower\nlying Allemands soils have organic surface layers 16 to 51 inches\nthick.  Sharkey soils at higher elevations have firm mineral\nlayers throughout the solum.\nDrainage and Permeability:  Westwego soils are poorly drained;\nrunoff is slow and permeability is very slow.  The water table is\nat a depth of 1 to 3 feet and is dependent on the pumping\nprocedures."
