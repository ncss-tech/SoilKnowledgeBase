  "OVERVIEW": "The Wickford series consists of subaqueous organic soils permanently submerged beneath approximately 0 to 3 meters of water on submerged organic landscapes of freshwater ponds, lakes, and reservoirs. The soil formed in 40 to 130 cm of highly decomposed organic material over loamy and/or sandy glacial material. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees Celsius and the mean annual precipitation is about 1143 millimeters.",
