  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils typically are noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches and are noncalcareous to depths of more than 40 inches in all pedons.  Base saturation typically is more than 80 percent and ranges from 60 to 100 percent in all subhorizons of the argillic horizon.  Depth to the top of the argillic horizon is less than 24 inches, and depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 15 to 50 inches.  Rock fragments range from 15 to 35 percent in a major part of the solum and in the C horizon and are mainly less than 3 inches in diameter but range from 1/8 to 10 inches in diameter.  Within the sand fraction a high percentage is medium and coarser angular sand which has a large proportion of flat bearing surfaces.  The solum and C horizons range from medium acid through mildly alkaline.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 64 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.\nThe A2 horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through  dry, 4 through 7 moist, and chroma of 1 through 4.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6.  It is typically gravelly coarse sandy clay loam and has 18 to 30 percent clay and 40 to 75 percent sand.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It is gravelly coarse sandy loam or loam with less than 18 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Crowfoot, Kelvin, Redtom, and Tomah series.  Crowfoot soils have less than 15 percent rock fragments.  Kelvin soils are calcareous in the lower part of the solum or in the C horizons and have continuous subhorizons of secondary calcium carbonate accumulation.  Redtom and Tomah soils have discontinuous argillic horizons in which silicate clay is accumulating in lamellae."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Westcreek soils are on alluvial fans, valley side slopes, or hills and ridges.  Slope gradients range from 5 to 30 or more percent.  The soils formed in parent sediments weathered and locally transported from beds of Dawson arkose or granite rock. At the type location the average annual precipitation is 17 inches, with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and early summer."
