  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to claystone bedrock or dense clay ranges from 60 to 80 inches. Coarse fragments of siliceous, ironstone, or sandstone pebbles range from a few to about 5 percent by volume. Base saturation ranges from 75 to 90 percent, by sum of cations, in some part of the Bt horizon. The average clay content of the control section ranges from 35 to 45 percent. The boundary between the A and Bt horizon is abrupt or clear and the texture change is abrupt.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4. It is fine sandy loam or loam. Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid unless limed.\nThe Bt1 and Bt2 horizons have hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 or 6. Some pedons have few to common mottles in shades of brown, red or yellow in the Bt2 horizon. Texture is clay loam, sandy clay, or clay. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral in the Bt1 horizon and from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the Bt2 horizon.\nThe Bt3 horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Faint to prominent mottles in shades of red, yellow, brown, or gray range from common to many, or the matrix is mottled in these colors. The texture is clay, sandy clay, or clay loam. Iron-manganese concretions and masses range from 2 to 12 percent by volume. Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline. Some pedons contain films and threads, soft masses, or concretions of calcium carbonate in the lower part.\nThe Bk, BCk, or BC horizons where present have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximorphic features in shades of red, brown, yellow, olive, gray, or white range from few to many and some pedons have a mottled matrix of these colors. The Ck horizon is claystone bedrock commonly interbedded with thin strata of grayish or reddish platy claystone, weakly cemented brownish or yellowish sandstone, or alkaline loamy and clayey sediments. Calcium carbonate in the form of soft masses and films and threads make up 5 to 25 percent of the total volume of this horizon.\nThe 2Cd horizon has colors in shades of red, brown, yellow, olive, gray and white. It is noncemented claystone bedrock interbedded with thin strata of grayish platy soft claystone and brownish sandstone. The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Castell, Edge, Hamby, Pedernales, Shatruce, Voca, Wichita and Winters series in the same family. Similar soils are Acove, Bluegrove, Grandfield and Miles series. Castell soils are 20 to 40 inches to gneiss bedrock. Pedernales, Wichita and Winters soils have sola greater than 60 inches. In addition, Wichita soils have secondary carbonates within 28 inches of the surface. Voca soils contain a higher percentage of fine sand and have a contact with fractured granite bedrock. Acove soils have a broken sandstone layer in the upper Bt horizon. Bluegrove soils are 20 to 40 inches to sandstone bedrock. Grandfield and Miles soils average less than 35 percent clay in the control section.  Hamby soils are well drained and in the active CEC activity class."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Weswind soils are on gently sloping and strongly sloping plains often on footslopes of receding escarpments of claystone and sandstone of Permian Age. Slope shape is convex. Slope gradients are dominantly 3 to 5 percent, but range from 1 to 8 percent. Some areas are dissected by gullies. The soil formed in residuum and colluvium from claystone interbedded with sandstone. The climate is dry subhumid. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 31.5 inches and mean annual temperature is 64 or 65 degrees F. Frost free days range from 210 to 230 days and elevations range from 900 to 1,400 feet. Thornthwaite P-E indices range from 38 to 42."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Wichita and Winters series and the Bluegrove, Cobb, Grandfield, and Vernon series. Bluegrove and Cobb soils are underlain by weakly cemented sandstone and are above on ridge crests. Grandfield, Winters and Wichita are below on smooth topography. In addition, Grandfield soils have fine-loamy control sections and Wichita soils have carbonates within a depth of 28 inches. Vernon soils do not have Bt horizons and are calcareous throughout. Vernon soils are below on scarps or on slightly lower hills."

Native vegetation is mainly sideoats grama, little bluestem, Arizona cottontop, buffalograss, Texas wintergrass, blue grama, Wrights threeawn, silver bluestem, and sand dropseed. Mesquite, lotebush, and pricklypear have invaded most areas."
