The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 59 degrees F.  The soil moisture control section is dry in all parts from mid July to mid October.  The soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches exceeds 41 degrees F from about March 20 to December 10 (260 days), and exceeds 47 degrees F from about April 20 to November 10.  The particle-size control section has a ratio of extractable iron oxide plus gibbsite to clay of 0.2 to 0.30.\nThe A horizon is 5YR 5/4, 4/6, 4/4, 5/3, 5/6, or 2.5YR 5/6. Moist color is 5YR 3/4, 4/3, 4/6, 7.5YR 3/4, or 2.5YR 3/6. The A horizon is clay loam, or loam.
