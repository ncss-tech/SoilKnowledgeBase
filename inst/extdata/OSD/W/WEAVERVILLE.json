  "OVERVIEW": "The Weaverville series consists of very deep, well drained soils on hills.  These soils formed in material weathered from weakly consolidated moderately fine-grained sediments and colluvium.  Slope ranges from 9 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",
