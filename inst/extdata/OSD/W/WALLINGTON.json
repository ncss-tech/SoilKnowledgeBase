  "BYREV": "Rev. LWK-PSP",
  "REVDATE": "03/2013",
  "STATES": "NY,PA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wallington Series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits. They are nearly level or gently sloping soils on lacustrine plains or basins. Permeability is moderate above the fragipan and slow in the fragipan and substratum. Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 37 inches.",

Rock fragments are usually absent but gravel content ranges up to 3 percent in the solum and up to 5 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. It has weak or moderate granular structure and is friable or very friable. Some pedons have a very dark grayish brown or black A horizon 3 to 5 inches thick. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid through moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 3. It ranges from silt loam to loamy very fine sand and very fine sandy loam. The horizon is massive, or it has weak platy or subangular blocky structure. It is friable or firm. It ranges from very strongly through moderately acid, unless limed.\nThe Bw horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. It has redoximorphic depletions and surfaces of peds have chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. It has weak or moderate, fine to coarse subangular blocky structure and is friable or firm. It ranges from very strongly through slightly acid.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. It has weak or moderate very coarse prismatic structure parting to weak platy, or the material within prisms is massive. It is firm or very firm. It ranges from very strongly acid through neutral.\nThe C horizon has colors similar to the Bx horizon. It ranges from loamy very fine sand to silt loam. It is friable or firm. It ranges from moderately acid through neutral."

Dalton soils have a lithologic discontinuity between a depth of 15 and 36 inches, below which the soil materials have more than 20 percent rock fragments.\nThe Canaseraga, Raynham, Scio, and Williamson series are similar soils in related families. Canaseraga soils have dominant chroma of more than 2 above depths of 20 inches. Raynham and Scio soils do not have fragipans. Williamson soils do not have subhorizons with dominant chroma of 1 or 2 either in the matrix or on surfaces of peds between the base of the Ap horizon and a depth of 20 inches."
