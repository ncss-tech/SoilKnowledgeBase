  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Fluventic subgroup based on irregular distribution of organic matter in the highly stratified layers between 19 and 84 inches. Distribution of carbonates within the profile has been affected by irrigation. In some pedons, segregated carbonates are present throughout the entire profile below the Bw horizon.  These are designated Bk horizons and no C horizon is designated.\nThe original competing series before taxonomy change were the Glendale (AZ) and Pima (AZ) series.  Glendale and Pima soils are intermittently moist in the moisture control section during July, August and September from summer thunderstorms.\nPreviously mapped as Panoche series in the Soil Survey of Mendota Area, California, Series 1940, No. 18 and Coalinga Area, California, Series 1944, No. 1. The classification of Westhaven series was established as Typic Torrifluvents.  This was changed to Fluventic Haplocambids when a cambic horizon was recognized in the Westhaven profile. The presence of a cambic horizon is based on the following characteristics:\n1. Soil structure in the cambic horizon (unless moist from irrigation or rainfall or drastically modified by deep ripping)\n2. Removal of carbonates from the cambic horizon\n3. Accumulation of carbonates below the cambic horizon which supports loss of carbonate from overlying horizons\n4. Higher chroma in the cambic horizon in some pedons\n5. Most areas of Westhaven soils are irrigated with 2 to 3 feet of water per year applied for crop production. Previous to irrigation only about 7 inches of precipitation coupled with flood water, was available for soil development. Movement of carbonates, fertilizer and salt through the soil profile has created more pronounced cambic horizons because of application of irrigation water. The recognition of a cambic horizon in this soil necessitates the placing of all saline-sodic and saline-alkali phases of Westhaven series into another soil series. These soils would classify as fine-silty, mixed, superactive, thermic Sodic Haplocambids. Many of these soils will be called Posochanet series. Posochanet soils occur on lower position in the landscape (fan skirts) than Westhaven soils (alluvial fans), which are not saline-sodic. Map unit 178 in Kings County should be correlated from Westhaven to Posochanet series.\nMajor Diagnostic Horizons:\n1. Ochric epipedon--0 to 7 inches (Ap)\n2. Cambic horizon--7 to 19 inches (Bw)\n2.1 Removal of carbonates from the cambic horizon\n3. Zone of redistribution--19 to 29 inches (Bk)"
