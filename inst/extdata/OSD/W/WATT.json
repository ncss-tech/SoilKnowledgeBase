  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 10 to 20 inches.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Content of rock fragments ranges from 35 to 70 percent in the control section.  These consist of fragments of black graphitic schist, most of which can be crushed to silty soil material.  Clay content in the control section averages 18 to 30 percent.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to extremely acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of lOYR through 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture of the A horizon is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of lOYR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 through 5 and chroma of 4 or less.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 through 4 and chroma of 3 or less.  Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon ranges from black through dark gray.  In some pedons the C horizon is streaked with brown and yellow.  Texture is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.  In some pedons there is a Cr horizon."

All of these soils have matrix colors with chroma of 4 or more in the Bw horizon.  Berks, Calvin Manlius, Tunkhannock, and Wyoming soils have rock fragments of shale.  Blasdell, Chenango, Dekalb, Hazleton, Itswoot, Parker, Sylco, and Warwick soils have a solum more than 20 inches thick.  Cardiff soils have rock fragments of slate.  Lippitt, Manlius, Oquaga, Tunkhannock, Warwick and Wyoming soils contain rounded till pebbles."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

These soils developed in a regolith weathered from black graphitic rock.  The average annual temperature ranges from 51 F to 59 degrees F.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 44 inches."

Cecil, Culpeper and Elioak soils have red Bt horizons containing more than 35 percent clay.  Hazel and Manor soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments.  Manor soils are micaceous."
