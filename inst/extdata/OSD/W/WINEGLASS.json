  "OVERVIEW": "The Wineglass series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium and residuum derived from mixed rock sources.  These soils are on mountain sideslopes.  Slopes are 8 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 21 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
