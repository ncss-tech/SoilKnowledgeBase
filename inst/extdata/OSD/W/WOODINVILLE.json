The\nparticle-size control section averages 0 to 5 percent coarse fragments, less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand, and\n18 to 32 percent clay.  The particle-size control section\ncontains thin (less than 1/4 inch to 2 inches) lenses of\norganic material totaling 1 to 15 inches in combined\nthickness.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 2 to 5\nmoist, 5 to 7 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist or dry, and\nhas many prominent mottles of 7.5YR and 5YR hue and chroma\nof 3 through 6.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a Bg horizon.\nThe Cg horizon, immediately below the Ap horizon, has hue of\n2.5Y or 5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 8 dry and has\nprominent mottles of dark reddish brown (5YR 3/4), yellowish\nred (5YR 4/6, 4/8), strong brown (7.5YR 5/6), dark brown\n(7.5YR 4/4), and yellowish red (10YR 5/6).  Below 12 inches\nthe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 4Y, or N value of 3 to 6\nmoist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 0 to 2 moist or dry.  It is\nnot mottled in some pedons.  It ranges from silty clay loam\nto silt loam and has thin lenses of fine sandy loam and\nloamy fine sand in some pedons. This horizon has moderate\nmedium angular blocky structure or is massive.  It is\nmoderately acid to very strongly acid."

They formed in stratified recent\nalluvium.  The average January temperature is 38 degrees F;\nthe average July temperature is 64 degrees F; and the\naverage annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  The\naverage annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 55 inches,\nmost of which falls as rain during the winter.  Each month\nof summer has at least 1 inch of rainfall.  Snow is\ninfrequent.  The frost free season is 170 to 200 days."
