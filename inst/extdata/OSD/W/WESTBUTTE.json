The soils are warmer than 41 degrees F. from May 1 to November 1.  The mean annual soil temperature is 40 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock, the mollic epipedon and the solum thickness are 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section is 18 to 30 percent clay and 35 to 70 percent gravel, cobbles, and stones.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 to 5 dry,  2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3 dry and moist.  This horizon has 0 to 5 percent pumiceous ash.  It is loam, very cobbly loam, cobbly loam, stony loam, very stony loam, and extremely stony loam.  It has 0 to 50 percent cobbles and stones and 0 to 45 percent gravel.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have an AB horizon having value of 4 or 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist 2 to 4 dry.  This horizon has subangular blocky or granular structure or both.  It is extremely cobbly clay loam, extremely cobbly loam, very cobbly clay loam, very stony loam or very cobbly loam.  It has 20 to 50 percent cobbles, 0 to 20 percent stones and 5 to 35 percent gravel.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline."
