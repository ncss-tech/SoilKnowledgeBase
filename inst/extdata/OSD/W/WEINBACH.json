    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 72 inches.  Depth to the fragipan ranges from 20 to 36 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is commonly silt loam and less commonly loam.  It is neutral to very strongly acid.  In a few areas where the soil is undisturbed there is a very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2) A horizon, 1 to 3 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly is silt loam and less commonly loam.  It is medium acid to very strongly acid.\nThe BE horizon or BA horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4 and is mottled.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6 and is mottled.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 6 and is mottled.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.  It is strongly acid or very strongly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Avonburg, Bartle, Doles, Dubois, Platea, and Wadsworth series.  Avonburg soils have coarse fragments in the lower part of the solum and have a lower B horizon formed in till.  Bartle soils contain less clay in the fragipan horizon and have grayer Btx and C horizons.  Doles soils do not have mica flakes in the solum.  Dubois soils lack mica flakes in the solum and are formed in 20 to 40 inches of loess and the underlying stratified materials.  Platea soils have 2 to 20 percent coarse fragments in the solum, are less acid, and formed in till strongly influenced by clayey shale and siltstone.  Wadsworth soils contain less silt in the sola and have C horizons of glacial till that commonly contains free carbonates."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weinbach soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 6 percent.  The Weinbach soils formed in old acid alluvium of stratified silt loam, silty clay loam, and loam with some sand in the underlying materials.  These materials are largely derived from shale, sandstone, and quartzite.  In places the material contains a component of glacial drift and possibly some loess.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 58 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  The somewhat poorly drained Weinbach soils are in a drainage sequence with the Wheeling, Sciotoville, Ginat, and Chilo soils.  Wheeling soils are well drained and are on broad flats and side slopes where the area is dissected.  Sciotoville soils are moderately well drained and are on nearly level and gently sloping areas.  Ginat soils are poorly drained and are on the level areas.  Chilo soils are very poorly drained and are in the narrow slightly concave areas."
