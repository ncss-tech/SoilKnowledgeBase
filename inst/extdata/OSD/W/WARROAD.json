Depth to carbonates and the silty 2C material ranges from 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 to 2.  It is fine sandy loam or loam.  The A horizon has a reaction of neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is fine sand, loamy fine sand or sandy loam.  It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sand, loamy fine sand or very fine sand.  Some pedons have thin gravel lenses with total gravel averaging less than 5 percent in the horizon.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has a hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is very fine sandy loam, silt loam or silty clay loam.  Sediments of the 2Cg horizon are finely stratified or laminated with clay.  Total clay averages less than 35 percent.  The reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Warroad soils are on glacial lake plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent.  They formed in loamy and sandy sediments over calcareous silty lacustrine sediments of late Wisconsinan Age.  Mean annual precipitation is 20 to 30 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 36 to 44 degrees F.  Elevation ranges from 785 to 1350 feet.  The frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."

Enstrom soils are on higher better drained positions and have an ochric epipedon.  Espelie soils are found in similar positions but have a clayey 2C horizon.  Hiwood soils are found in higher positions and are sandy throughout.  Kratka soils contain more sand and gravel in the 2C horizon.  Wabanica soils are found in similar positions but do not have a sandy mantle."
