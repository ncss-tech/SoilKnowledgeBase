  "OVERVIEW": "The Winema series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum weathered from sedimentary rock. Winema soils are on coastal hills and have slopes of 3 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 85 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mean annual soil temperature is about 51 to 54 degrees F. The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F. under canopy cover. The soils are usually moist and are dry for less than 45 consecutive days in all parts between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the four-month period following the summer solstice. Depth to sedimentary bedrock is dominantly greater than 60 inches but ranges from 40 to about 80 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The upper part of the particle-size control section has a P-retention of 95 to 100 percent, ammonium-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 2.0 to 4.0 percent, and moist bulk density of 0.55 to 0.85 g/cubic centimeter Reaction is strongly acid to very strongly acid in the A horizons and is very strongly acid below.\nThe Ap, A, and AB horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist and 3 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry to depth of 12 to 25 inches. Value and chroma are 1 unit greater below these depths in some pedons. It has 10 to 15 percent organic matter and a melanic index greater than 1.7.  The Ap and A horizons have an apparent field texture of medial silt loam with 20 to 27 percent clay.  The AB horizon, when present, has an apparent field texture of medial silty clay loam with 27 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 2BA horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 through 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  Texture is silty clay loam with 30 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent paragravel.\nThe 2Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 3 to 6 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 30 percent paragravel.\nThe 2C horizon or 2BC horizon (when present), has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6 moist and dry, chroma of 4 to 6 moist, and 4 to 8 dry. Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 60 percent paragravel."
