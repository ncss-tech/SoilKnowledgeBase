  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wintercanyon soils occur on backslopes of mountains. Elevations are 3,800 to 6,200 feet. Slopes are 30 to 90 percent. The soil is formed in colluvium and residuum from argillite mixed with a small amount of volcanic ash. The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 25 to 35 inches. The mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 45 to 85 days."

Deck soils are moderately deep to bedrock, have a mollic epipedon with a mixed mantle of volcanic ash and loamy-skeletal cambic horizon. Kettlecreek soils are deep to argillite bedrock, have loamy-skeletal colluvium with a small amount of volcanic ash in surface horizons, and are on backslopes. Slicklog soils are very deep to bedrock and are on side slopes and fans of mountains."
