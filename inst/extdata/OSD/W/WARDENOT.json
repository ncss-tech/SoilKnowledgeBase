  "OVERVIEW": "The Wardenot series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Wardenot soils formed on alluvial fans, fan piedmonts, fan skirts, alluvial flats, and inset fans.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
