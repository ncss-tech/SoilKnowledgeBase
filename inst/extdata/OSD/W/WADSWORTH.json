Rock fragments range from 0 to 4 percent in the A, BE, and Bt horizons and from 2 to 15 percent in the Btx, BC, and C horizons. The particle-size control section averages less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser and averages 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 (6 or more dry), and chroma of 1 to 3. Some pedons have A horizons, 3 to 13 cm (1 to 5 in) thick, with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 (4 or 5 dry), and chroma of 2. An E horizon, where present, is up to 25 cm (10 in) thick with hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 (more than 6 dry), chroma of 2 or 3, and few to many redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 to 6. The Ap or A horizon is typically silt loam.  The Ap, A, and E horizons commonly are extremely acid to moderately acid, but the Ap horizon ranges to neutral where limed.\nThe BE horizon (B/E in some pedons) has clay depletions on faces of peds that indicate degradation with value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 or less. The matrix has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 to 6 and redoximorphic features with chroma of 2 or less. The BE horizon is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 to 8 and few to many redoximorphic features; and faces of peds have chroma of 2 or less. It is silty clay loam, clay loam, or silt loam. It is extremely acid to moderately acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, chroma of 3 to 6, and few to many high and low chroma redoximorphic features, except some pedons have subhorizons that do not have redoximorphic features. Faces of prisms have coats with hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or silt loam. It is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part and moderately acid to neutral in the lower part.\nThe BC horizon has colors similar to the Btx horizon. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, loam or silt loam. It is strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, silt loam, or loam. It is moderately acid to moderately alkaline and typically contains free carbonates."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Bartle, Doles, Dubois, Patricksburg, Platea, and Weinbach series. Bartle soils contain less rock fragments in the lower part of the control section and the C horizon. Doles soils contain less sand in the lower part of the solum and in the substratum. The Dubois soils have the base of the argillic horizon at more than 203 cm (80 in). Patricksburg soils have a paralithic contact at 152 to 203 cm (60 to 80 in). Platea soils formed in younger age till and in slightly different climate characterized by more snow and slightly higher precipitation. Weinbach soils lack an argillic horizon above the fragipan."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in till strongly influenced by sandstone and clay shale. Mean annual precipitation ranges from about 830 to 1320 mm (33 to 52 in) and the mean annual temperature commonly ranges from about 6 degrees C in cooler locations to 11 degrees C (43 to 52 degrees F)."

Moderately well drained Bogart, well drained Chili, well drained Conotton, and somewhat poorly drained Jimtown soils lack fragipans and are on nearby sandy and gravelly outwash terraces. The well drained Chagrin and moderately well drained Lobdell soils are on nearby flood plains. The somewhat poorly drained Fitchville, moderately well drained Glenford, and poorly drained Sebring soils lack fragipans and are on nearby silty lacustrine terraces. The poorly drained Frenchtown soils are on nearby base slopes and depressions on the till plain. The moderately well drained Rittman soils are on nearby gently sloping to steeper sloping interfluves and side slopes on the till plain."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon include:\n1. Ochric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of about 36 cm (14 in) (Ap, BE);\n2. Argillic horizon - from a depth of about 36 to 112 cm (14 to 44 in) (Bt, Btx1, Btx2);\n3. Fragipan - from depths of about 58 to 112 cm (23 to 44 in) (Btx1, Btx2);\n4. Redoximorphic features from depths of about 20 to 152 cm (8 to 60 in) (BE, Bt, Btx1, Btx2, BC, and C horizons).\nA moderately shallow variant was correlated in Stark Co., Ohio. This variant will be evaluated during MLRA maintenance to determine if a new series is needed.\nThe August, 2000 revision included numerous changes made to all parts of the OSD. Pedon description was updated to include redoximorphic features.\nThe Wadsworth series and the Platea series now have significant overlap of attribute ranges in characteristics. Both series are correlated and by consensus are needed. Future MLRA maintenance investigations should identify more specific attribute ranges to identify a soil property diagnostic criteria to retain these two series separately. Platea soils are generally located north of the Wadsworth soils. By inference they are younger (though both are formed in Wisconsinan age till), and the extreme northern Platea and extreme southern Wadsworth soils are on different till members. Also the extreme climate difference from the northernmost Platea to the southernmost Wadsworth is somewhat contrasting, but is not generally definitive for differentiating.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Characterization data for the Wadsworth series is located at the NCSS KSSL Soil Characterization Database.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
