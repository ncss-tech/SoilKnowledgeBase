  "OVERVIEW": "The Weloy series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils on uplands.  These soils formed in material weathered from hard and soft green, chlorite, and talc schist.  Slope is 2 to 75 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 122 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 81 degrees F.",

It is gravelly silty clay loam, gravelly clay loam, gravelly silt loam, or very gravelly silt loam.  It is 10 to 30 percent moderately hard and hard schist pebbles .08 to 3 inches in size.

It is clay loam, silty clay, or clay and is gravelly or very gravelly.  The horizon is 15 to 40 percent gravel 1 to 3 inches in size and 5 to 15 percent cobbles 3 to 6 inches in size.  Total coarse fragment content ranges from 20 to 50 percent and averages more than 35 percent by volume in the particle-size control section.  Reaction in 1:1 water is medium acid or slightly acid."

The soils formed in uptilted hard and soft green, chlorite, or talc schist or volcanic breccia containing schist fragments.  Elevation ranges from 3 to 453 feet.  The mean annual temperature is 81 degrees F., and does not vary by more than 34 degrees F from month to month.  The mean annual maximum temperature is 88 degrees F., and the mean annual minimum temperature is 75 degrees F.  The mean annual rainfall is about 122 inches (and presumably is higher in the higher elevations) and varies from 90 to 149 inches from year to year, with the driest months (February, March, and April) averaging 6 inches per month."
