  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitepost series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils formed in loamy and sandy sediments overlying silty lacustrine sediments on outwash plains and lake plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 889 mm (35 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 10.0 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
