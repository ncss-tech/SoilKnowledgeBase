  "OVERVIEW": "The Weepah series consists of very shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from sedimentary rocks.  Weepah soils are on mountain slopes.  Slopes are l5 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
