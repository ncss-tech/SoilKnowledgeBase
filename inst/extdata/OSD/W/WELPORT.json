Cave (MLRA 40, 41, and 42) soils have a hue of 10YR or 7.5YR in both the A and B horizons, and receive summer monsoonal precipitation. Goodsprings (MLRA 30) soils have a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR in the Bk and Bkm horizons and do not have an indurated petrocalcic horizon. Irongold (MLRA 30) soils are on limestone alluvium on fan remnants. Simona (MLRA 42, 77C, and 77D) soils are on upland plains, mesa tops, and low ridges, have hues of 5YR to 10YR throughout, and have less than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section. Vace (MLRA 30) soils formed from calcareous loess and mixed alluvium and are on fan remnants and ballenas. Goodsprings, Irongold, and Vace soils (MLRA 30) are in the Mojave Desert with frost free seasons of as low as 180 days and are usually moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October."
