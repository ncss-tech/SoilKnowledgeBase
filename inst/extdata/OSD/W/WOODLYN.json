    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. Depth to the strongly cemented ortstein pan is 10 to 14 inches.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.  Pedons in uncultivated areas have an A horizon 3 to 7 inches thick similar to the Ap horizon.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam.  Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bsm1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is a strongly cemented or indurated ortstein pan that breaks to loamy sand or sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Consistence is very hard or extremely hard when dry and very firm, or extremely firm when moist.\nThe 2Bsm2 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is continuously weakly cemented with slightly hard to hard dry consistence.  It breaks to loamy sand or sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.  Some pedons have a 2Bs horizon that has 15 to 35 percent ortstein concretions 1/4 to 2 inches in diameter having consistence of slightly hard to hard when dry.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is coarse sand or sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Woodlyn soils are on outwash terraces and outwash plains at elevations of 50 to 300 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soil formed in loess, volcanic ash and glacial outwash.  Woodlyn soils are in a marine climate with warm dry summers and cool moist winters.  Snow cover is intermittent.  The average annual precipitation is 35 to 55 inches, which falls mostly between October and May.  Each of the summer months has at least one inch of rainfall.  Mean January temperature is 36 degrees F; mean July temperature is 62 degrees F; and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F. The frost-free season is 150 to 190 days."
