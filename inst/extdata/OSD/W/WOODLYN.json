  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodlyn series consists of shallow poorly drained soils formed in loess, volcanic ash and glacial outwash.  Woodlyn soils are on outwash terraces and outwash plains and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 45 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",

Reaction is strongly acid or moderately acid.\nThe 2Bsm1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.  It is a strongly cemented or indurated ortstein pan that breaks to loamy sand or sand.  Reaction is moderately acid or slightly acid.
