  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wiskan soils are typically on mountain crests, shoulders and side slopes. They also may occur on lava plateau escarpments in Oregon. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert, argillite and other siliceous and volcanic rock and are commonly overlain with a thin loess mantle.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is cool semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
