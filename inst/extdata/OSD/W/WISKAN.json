  "OVERVIEW": "The Wiskan series consist of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in a thin loess layer over residuum and colluvium derived from chert, argillite and other mixed rocks.  Wiskan soils are on mountain crests, shoulders and side slopes.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from chert, argillite and other siliceous and volcanic rock and are commonly overlain with a thin loess mantle.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations are 1,345 to 2,445 meters.  The climate is cool semiarid with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 360 mm; mean annual temperature is 6 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 70 to 100 days."
