    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Birdsley, Celeton, Goldyke, McCracken, Oceanet, Perlor, Roic, Slatery and Somorent series.  Birdsley, Goldyke, McCracken, Oceanet, Perlor, and Somorent soils have less than 35 percent parafragments in the paticle-size control section. Celeton soils have diatomite parent material. Roic and Slatery soils are moist in some part for short periods during winter and early spring months and for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weena soils are on hills and sideslopes of plateaus. They formed in residuum derived from Tertiary sandstone and siltstone of lacustrine origin. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,280 to 1,524 meters.  The climate is cool-arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 200 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."
