  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist and is saturated with water during several months each year when not artificially drained. The annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees F. The solum is 30 to 50 inches thick. The soil usually is free of coarse fragments but some pedons have 5 to 15 percent gravel and cobbles. The pscs averages 40 to 55 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 24 inches thick. The lower part of the mollic epipedon has distinct or prominent masses of iron accumulation and concretions of iron and manganese. Depth to redoximorphic concentrations ranges from near the surface to 15 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam in the upper part with 18 to 40 percent clay and silty clay loam in the lower part with 27 to 40 percent clay. It has 0 to 3 percent cobbles and 0 to 10 percent gravel. Reaction is slightly acid to strongly acid.\nThe BA horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay or clay with 35 to 55 percent clay. It has 0 to 3 percent gravel. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 moist , 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry. Texture is clay or silty clay with 40 to 55 percent clay. It has 0 to 3 percent gravel. Reaction is moderately acid or strongly acid.\nThe Cg and BCg horizons have color and texture similar to the Bg horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Blend, Darwin, Ricco, Saddlerock, and Stillwater series. The Blend soils have buried horizons within a depth of 24 to 36 inches and are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the 3Bgb or 3Bkgb horizons.  The Darwin soils have a cambic horizon that is slightly alkaline to slightly acid and may contain carbonates. Ricco soils lack redox concentrations in the lower part of the mollic epipedon, have a soil reaction ranging from neutral to slightly acid and is in a 11 to 16 inch mean annual precipitation zone.  Saddlerock soils have an average annual soil temperature of 47 to 51 degrees F. and have one or more buried A horizons.\nStillwater soils have secondary carbonates within the control section and are moderately or strongly alkaline."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Waldo soils are on narrow flood plains and fans at elevations of 100 to 1,500 feet. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in clayey alluvium from mixed, but dominantly basic igneous materials. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The average annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 60 inches. The average annual temperature is 50 to 55 degrees F. The average January temperature is 39 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 67 degrees F. The frost-free season is 160 to 235 days."
