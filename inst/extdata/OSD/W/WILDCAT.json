(Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nAbrupt texture change - at 8 inches\nThe proper classification of this series is in question. The Aquertic subgroup requires a combination of Aquic and Vertic properties. In other words, aquic conditions and cracks, slickensides, wedge shaped aggregates or linear extensibility of 6.0 cm. These properties were not described. The type location should be visited and the pedon described and properly classified.\nFormerly classified as a Planosol."
