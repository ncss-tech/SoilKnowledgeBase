The soils are formed in residuum from Coconino sandstone or Kaibab formation. Elevations range from 6800 to 7200 feet. The average annual precipitation ranges from approximately 18 to 22 inches. The mean annual air temperature is approximately 44 degrees F."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - 1 to 8 inches. (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon - 8 to 33 inches. (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons)\nAbrupt texture change - at 8 inches\nThe proper classification of this series is in question. The Aquertic subgroup requires a combination of Aquic and Vertic properties. In other words, aquic conditions and cracks, slickensides, wedge shaped aggregates or linear extensibility of 6.0 cm. These properties were not described. The type location should be visited and the pedon described and properly classified.\nFormerly classified as a Planosol.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
