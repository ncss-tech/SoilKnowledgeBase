The well drained Armiesburg and Nolin soils contain less clay in the series control section and are on higher-lying natural levees and flood-plain steps. The poorly drained Petrolia soils have less clay in the control series section and are on similar landforms. The poorly drained Vincennes soils have less clay in the series control section and are on slightly higher-lying flood-plain steps."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and moderately low or low (0.07 to 0.42 micrometers/s) in the substratum. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part of the solum and very slow in the substratum. The potential for surface water runoff is negligible. In poorly drained areas the depth to an intermittent apparent high water table is from 0.3 meters (1 foot) above the surface to 0.3 meters (1 foot) below the surface from December to May. In undrained, very poorly drained areas the maximum ponding depth is 0.6 meters (2 feet) above the surface from November to June. Wilhite soils are subject to occasional or frequent periods of  flooding."
