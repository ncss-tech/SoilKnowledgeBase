  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilhite series consists of very deep, poorly drained or very poorly drained soils that formed in clayey alluvium. These soils are on backswamps and low-lying flood-plain steps. Slopes are 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C (54 degrees F). The mean annual precipitation is about 1118 mm (44 inches).",

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high (1.41 to 4.23 micrometers/s) in the upper part of the solum and moderately low or low (0.07 to 0.42 micrometers/s) in the substratum. Permeability is moderately slow in the upper part of the solum and very slow in the substratum. The potential for surface water runoff is negligible. In poorly drained areas the depth to an intermittent apparent high water table is from 0.3 meters (1 foot) above the surface to 0.3 meters (1 foot) below the surface from December to May. In undrained, very poorly drained areas the maximum ponding depth is 0.6 meters (2 feet) above the surface from November to June. Wilhite soils are subject to occasional or frequent periods of  flooding."
