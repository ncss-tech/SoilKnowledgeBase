  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitore series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium, alluvium, or alpine till derived mainly from limestone, calcareous shale, marly shale, or calcareous sandstone and siltstone. These soils are on alluvial fans, till plains, moraines, hills and mountains.  Slopes are 2 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 26 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 38 degrees F.",
