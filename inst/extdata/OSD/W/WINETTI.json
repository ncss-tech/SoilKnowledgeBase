  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average 35 to 50 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at depths of 20 inches is about 49 to 64 degrees F.  The organic matter content appears to decrease irregularly with depth.  These soils are noncalcareous to strongly calcareous in the A horizon and moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous in the C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and choma of 2 to 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is stratified gravelly and very gravelly loamy sand, gravelly and very gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand and gravelly loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone, limestone and shale.  Slope gradients are 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 80 to 100 days.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 45 degrees F., and the average summer temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F."

    "content": "REMARKS:  These soils were formerly classified as Alluvial soils.\nDiagnostic horizon and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to 4 inches (A horizon)\nFluvent feature - on irregular decrease in organic matter\nUstic feature - the soil moisture control section is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in most years but is not dry in all parts more than half the time that the soil temperature at 20 inches is above 41 degrees F.\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class was added in 03/2003 to the taxonomic classification by the National Soil Survey Center on request of the Lakewood MLRA office, without review of the soil series property data.
