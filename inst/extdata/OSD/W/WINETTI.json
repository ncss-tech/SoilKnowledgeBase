  "OVERVIEW": "The Winetti series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in mixed alluvium from sedimentary rocks.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual temperature is 44 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is 16 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average 35 to 50 percent.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 44 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at depths of 20 inches is about 49 to 64 degrees F.  The organic matter content appears to decrease irregularly with depth.  These soils are noncalcareous to strongly calcareous in the A horizon and moderately calcareous or strongly calcareous in the C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and choma of 2 to 4.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist and chroma of 2 to 6.  It is stratified gravelly and very gravelly loamy sand, gravelly and very gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand and gravelly loam."

They formed in mixed alluvium from sandstone, limestone and shale.  Slope gradients are 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches and the freeze-free period ranges from 80 to 100 days.

The remainder of this document has not been updated."
