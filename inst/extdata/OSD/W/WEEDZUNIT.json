  "OVERVIEW": "The Weedzunit series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum or colluvium derived from volcanic mudflow breccia. These soils are on hills, escarpments and lahars.  Slopes are 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
