  "OVERVIEW": "The Westshore series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in fine alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Westshore soils are on marine terraces and have slopes of 2 to 9 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 225 millimeters (9 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 16.5 degrees C. (62 degrees F.)",
