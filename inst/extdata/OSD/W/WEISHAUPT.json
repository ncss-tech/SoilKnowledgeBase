  "OVERVIEW": "The Weishaupt series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium over lacustrine deposits derived from mixed igneous rocks.  Weishaupt soils are on flood plains on deltas.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 127 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 12 degrees C.",
