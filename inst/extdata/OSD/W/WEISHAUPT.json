Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Elevations range from 1158 to 1219 meters.  The climate is arid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 100 to 150 mm.  The mean annual temperature is 11 to 13 degrees C., the mean January temperature is -1 to 0 degrees C., and the mean July temperature is 21 to 22 degrees C.
