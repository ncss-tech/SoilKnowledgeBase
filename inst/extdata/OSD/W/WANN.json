Changed thickness of mollic epipedon to fall into the requirements of a mollic epipedon.  Added particle size clay and sand content in RIC. Added clay content and sand content to horizon data in RIC. Updated competing series. Changed landform to flood plains from lower slopes of the landscape in geographic setting. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters. Updated geographically associated soils. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
