  "OVERVIEW": "The Wann series includes very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in stratified calcareous alluvium.  These soils are on flood plains in river valleys in Central Loess Plains, MLRA 75. Slope ranges 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (5l degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 640 millimeters (25 inches) at the type location.",

Changed thickness of mollic epipedon to fall into the requirements of a mollic epipedon.  Added particle size clay and sand content in RIC. Added clay content and sand content to horizon data in RIC. Updated competing series. Changed landform to flood plains from lower slopes of the landscape in geographic setting. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters. Updated geographically associated soils. Changed precipitation values from centimeters to millimeters."
