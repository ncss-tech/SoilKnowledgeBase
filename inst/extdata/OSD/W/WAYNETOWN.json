  "OVERVIEW": "The Waynetown series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified gravelly and sandy outwash. The Waynetown soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are on outwash plains and stream terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 mm (40 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
