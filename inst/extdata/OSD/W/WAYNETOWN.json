  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy and gravelly outwash. They are deep or very deep to calcareous, stratified gravelly and sandy outwash. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 940 to 1067 mm (37 to 42 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 11 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F)."

When mapped in association with Waynetown soils, the Mahalasville soils have gravelly substrata. The well drained Rush soils are on higher lying positions on stream terraces and outwash plains."

The depth to the top of an intermittent apparent high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) during the winter and spring in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is very low or low. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderate in the solum and very rapid in the underlying material."
