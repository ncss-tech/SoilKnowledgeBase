Rock fragments, mainly gravels and subrounded channers, range from 10 to 30 percent by volume in the horizons above the lacustrine materials, and from 0 to 5 percent in the horizons within the lacustrine materials. Some pedons contain glacially reworked lacustrine materials below the loamy till mantle. These reworked lacustrine materials may have up to 10 percent rock fragments, mostly gravel. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral throughout, generally increasing with depth.\nThe A or Ap horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe Eg horizon, where present, has a hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture is loam or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has platy or blocky structure and is friable or firm. It has common or many, distinct or prominent iron accumulations, with chroma higher than the matrix.\nSome pedons have a Bw or Bg horizon, in addition to or in place of the Eg horizon, with hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. It has blocky structure and is friable or firm. It has common or many redoximorphic features.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is loam, silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine-earth fraction. Structure is coarse or very coarse prismatic with platy, blocky or massive interiors. Consistence is firm or very firm, and brittle.\nThe 2Bx horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6. Texture is loam, silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay. Consistence is firm or very firm.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture is loam, silt loam, silt, silty clay loam or silty clay. The material is massive with some plate like divisions. Consistence is firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Erie and the Volusia series in the same family, both of which do not have the underlying, nearly rock fragment-free horizons within the control section.\nThe Dalton and the Wallington series are similar soils in related families. The Dalton series has a coarse-silty particle-size control section and does not have the underlying, nearly rock fragment-free horizons within the control section. The Wallington series also has a coarse silty particle-size control section and does not have the overlying loamy mantle."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wiscoy soils are nearly level to strongly sloping soils on elevated lake plains and toeslopes of valley sides. Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent. These soils formed in till derived mainly from siltstone, shale and fine-grained sandstone that overlies lacustrine silts and clays. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 48 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches, and the frost-free season ranges from 110 to 150 days. These soils are at elevations that range from 1,200 feet to 1,800 feet above sea level."

The Erie and the Volusia soils do not have the underlying, nearly rock fragment-free horizons within the control section. The Mardin soils are also on nearby higher areas that are moderately well drained and they do not have the underlying, nearly rock fragment-free horizons within the control section. Rhinebeck soils are on nearby landscapes that do not have a fragipan or the overlying loamy mantle. The Rushford soils have less clay in the control section and are on nearby higher areas that are moderately well drained. Valois soils are on nearby landscapes that are well drained, and do not have a fragipan or the underlying, nearly rock fragment-free horizons within the control section."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil is currently being mapped in Cattaraugus County, New York and Allegany County, New York as map units 132A, 132B, and 132C (previously called Volusia channery silt loam, lacustrine substratum). Soils similar to the Wiscoy soil, but dominantly deeper than 40 inches to the lacustrine materials, have been previously mapped in Steuben County, New York as a component of the undifferentiated group Mardin and Volusia channery silt loams, silty substratum (5,145 Ac.), and in Tioga County, Pennsylvania as a Volusia channery silt loam, silty substratum (3,840 Ac.). Areas of this soil tend to be concentrated along north flowing river valleys and their tributaries.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 10 inches (Ap horizon)\n2. Cambic horizon - the zone from 10 to 14 inches (Eg horizon)\n3. Fragipan - the zone from 14 to 38 inches (Bx1 and 2Bx2 horizons)\n4. Aquept suborder - an ochric epipedon underlain directly, or within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface, by a horizon with 50 percent or more of chroma 2 or less with redox. concentrations (Eg horizon - 10 to 14 inches)\n5. Aeric subgroup - a horizon, between the plow layer and a depth of 75 cm below the mineral soil surface, with 50 percent or more of chroma of 3 or more (Bx1 horizon - 14 to 34 inches)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
