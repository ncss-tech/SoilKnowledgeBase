  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 35 inches.  Depth to bedrock is commonly 10 feet or more.  Rock fragments, dominantly of water-rounded sandstone or siltstone up to 8 inches in size, range from 15 to 50 percent by volume in the A horizon, from 20 to 60 percent in the B horizon and from 35 to 75 percent in the BC and C horizons.  The soil ranges from extremely acid to moderately acid in all horizons, unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Undisturbed pedons have a thin A horizon and some pedons have an E horizon.  Texture is fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture is coarse sandy loam, sandy loam or fine sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction with an average or more than 50 percent fine sand or coarser.  Some pedons have a BA horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is sandy loam, loamy sand or sand in the fine-earth fraction but texture above a depth of 25 inches is sandy loam."

Berks, Blasdell, and Cardiff soils have B horizon textures of silt loam and loam.  Calvin, Dekalb, Lehew, Lippitt, Manlius, Oquaga, Sylco, and Watt soils have bedrock between 20 and 40 inches.  Chenango and Tunkhannock soils have B horizons whose texture is silt loam, loam or sandy loam with less than 50 percent sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Hazleton soils contain angular rock fragments and have B horizon texture of loam and sandy loam with less than 50 percent of fine sand coarser than very fine sand in the particle-size control section.  Itswoots soils have sola thicker than 40 inches.  Parker soils contain rock fragments of gneiss.  Remote soils have more than 22 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Warwick soils have color value of 3 or less in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wyoming soils are nearly level to very steep soils on outwash terraces, moraines, kames, eskers, and valley trains.  Slope gradients range from about 0 to 45 percent.  They formed in gravelly, water-sorted material derived from red and gray sandstone, siltstone, and shale.  The climate is humid and temperate.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 45 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 45 to 55 degrees F., and the frost-free season ranges from 120 to 180 days."
