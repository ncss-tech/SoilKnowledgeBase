    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock is more than 5 feet. Content of mica flakes ranges from few to common throughout.  Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid.  Fragment content in the Cg horizon ranges from 0 to 10 percent and in the 2C horizon from 65 to 90 percent.  Fragments are metasedimentary gravels, cobbles and stones.\nThe O horizon forms under rhododendron thickets in hanging coves and appears as a thick root mat. In cleared areas on floodplains, the O horizon is absent or very thin.  Extent and type of vegetative cover influences the thickness of the O horizons.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  The texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam.\nThe Cg horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The texture is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, or sand.\nThe 2C horizon has a hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The texture is loamy sand or sand in the fine earth fraction."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wesser soils are on nearly level parts of floodplains and in hanging coves in the Blue Ridge (MLRA 130). Normally located in the upper reaches of watersheds, these hanging coves occur where the cove floor is relatively wide for some distance before narrowing at a lower elevation. The lower terminus is usually characterized by a waterfall.  Seeps and springs also are common features of these areas.  Micro relief is hummocky on the less sloping portions of these hanging coves, and Wesser soils are commonly on the lower, nearly level parts of hummocks.  On floodplains, Wesser soils are in areas that are wetter and more flood-prone, including small depressions.  Wesser soils formed in coarse textured alluvium and the underlying skeletal alluvial strata deposited by high energy flooding events. The elevation ranges from 2,500 feet to 5,000 feet. Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 70 inches. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Alarka, Cataloochee, Cheoah, Chestnut, Cullasaja, Dellwood, Edneyville, Guyot, Jeffrey, Oconaluftee, Plott, Santeetlah, Soco, Spivey, Stecoah, Tuckasegee, Wayah, Whiteoak, and series.  Of these, only Alarka and Dellwood soils are found in hanging coves or floodplains.  Alarka soils are poorly drained, in a fine-loamy over sandy or sandy skeletal particle size family, and are on higher, more sloping parts of hummocks. Dellwood soils are better drained and on higher parts of the floodplain or nearer to stream channels.  Cataloochee, Guyot, Oconaluftee, and Wayah soils are on ridges and side slopes in frigid temperature regimes.  Cheoah, Chestnut, Edneyville, Jeffrey, Plott, Soco, and Stecoah soils are on ridges and side slopes in mesic temperature regimes.  Cullasaja, Santeetlah, Spivey, Tuckasegee, and Whiteoak soils are well drained and on benches, foot slopes, toe slopes, drainageways, and fans in nearby coves."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Where Wesser occurs in hanging coves, all of the acreage is in woodland, primarily in National Forest or in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  These areas are critical habitat for amphibians, especially salamanders.  The dominant vegetative cover is rhododendron thicket, which provides shading and are located where seepage water provides moisture for the development of the thick organic mat.  Evergreen trees such as hemlock, white pine, and red spruce are common over story species.  Where Wesser occurs on floodplains, use and vegetation are variable. Some areas are used for pasture and hay. Idle areas are commonly in alders, sedges, rushes, and weeds.  Common trees in forested areas are yellow poplar, sycamore, hemlock, white pine, red maple, and yellow birch."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Soils of the Wesser series in hanging coves were mapped as part of the Humaquepts map unit in the Haywood County Area, NC Soil Survey.  However, due to the small size and variability of the map units, no series were established.  In these hanging coves, Wesser soils are mainly mapped in a complex with the poorly drained Alarka series.  Some soils may have a frigid temperature regime.  However, the small extent and unique properties of these soils do not warrant a separation of series based on temperature at this time.  This soil was sampled and analyzed by the National Soil Survey Laboratory in Lincoln, NE\nSample Number S99NC-173-002.\nRevisions made 9/07(HCD) adjusts the OSD to reflect Lab Data.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon 0 to 6 inches (Oa, and A horizons)\nSandy-skeletal particle size class the zone from 10 to 40 inches (Cg1, Cg2, and 2C horizons)\nHumaqueptic subgroup feature materials in the upper 6 inches that have color value, moist, of 3 or less and base saturation of less than 50 percent in some part within 40 inches of the mineral soil surface\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
