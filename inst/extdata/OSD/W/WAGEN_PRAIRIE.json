  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wagen Prairie series consists of moderately deep to paralithic contact with shale, moderately well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of silty or loamy sediments and the underlying shale.  These soils are on side slopes on dissected bedrock controlled uplands. Slope ranges from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
