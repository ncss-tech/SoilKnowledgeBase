The soils formed in material weathered from sandstone. The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. Mean annual precipitation varies from 900 to 1780 millimeters (35 to 70 inches). Occasional snow occurs above 3,000 feet.  Mean January temperature is 7 degrees C. (44 degrees F); mean July temperature is 22 degrees C. (72 degrees F); and mean annual temperature is 14 degrees C. (57 degrees F). The frost-free period is 125 to 280 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was reclassified in January 2008 due to the presence of bedrock with cracks mostly closer together than 10 centimeters and coatings on the rock fragments.  The soil lacks a lithic contact but has material weathered from residuum. The original concept had fractured bedrock within 25 to 50 centimeters. In order to not have a contrasting particle size control section, depth to the fragmental material is restricted to 25 to 36 centimeters.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 3 centimeters. (A horizon)\n2. Cambic horizon: the zone from 3 to 30 centimeters (Bw, Bt horizons) There is a slight increase in clay content over the A horizon, but it is not enough to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters centimeters has 1 percent clay by weight, and 89 percent gravel by volume. (Bt and C horizons)\n4. Fragmental material - the zone from 30 to 200 centimeters (C horizon)\nWhere Witherell is used in MLRA 15, it needs to be re-examined.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
