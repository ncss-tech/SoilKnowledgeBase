  "OVERVIEW": "The Witherell series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in material weathered from sandstone. Witherell soils are loamy in the upper part of the profile with fragmental gravel in the lower. These soils are on hills and mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1500 millimeters (50 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F.).",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil was reclassified in January 2008 due to the presence of bedrock with cracks mostly closer together than 10 centimeters and coatings on the rock fragments.  The soil lacks a lithic contact but has material weathered from residuum. The original concept had fractured bedrock within 25 to 50 centimeters. In order to not have a contrasting particle size control section, depth to the fragmental material is restricted to 25 to 36 centimeters.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon: the zone from 0 to 3 centimeters. (A horizon)\n2. Cambic horizon: the zone from 3 to 30 centimeters (Bw, Bt horizons) There is a slight increase in clay content over the A horizon, but it is not enough to meet the requirements of an argillic horizon.\n3. Particle-size control section - the zone from 25 to 100 centimeters centimeters has 1 percent clay by weight, and 89 percent gravel by volume. (Bt and C horizons)\n4. Fragmental material - the zone from 30 to 200 centimeters (C horizon)\nWhere Witherell is used in MLRA 15, it needs to be re-examined.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nKeys to Soil Taxonomy, 12th edition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
