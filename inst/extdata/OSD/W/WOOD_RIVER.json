  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Cavo, Degrey, Dudley, Dwight and Farmsworth series in the same family.  Cavo soils formed in glacial till, contain more sand, and have carbonates higher in the profile.  Degrey soils formed in silty material over glacial till on uplands and typically have carbonates higher in the profile.  Dudley and Farmsworth soils have a mollic epipedon thicker than 20 inches.  Dwight soils derived from clay shales influenced by loess."

These soils formed in silty and clayey alluvium.  In places the alluvium originated in nearby loess uplands.  In some areas the surface contains an increment of loess.  The range of mean annual precipitation is 18 to 28 inches, and the range of mean annual temperature is 49 to 52 degrees F."

The Cozad, Hall, and Hord soils are higher on the landscape and do not have a natric horizon.  Rusco soils are fine-silty and are in depressions on stream terraces.  Silver Creek soils have a seasonal high water table at 1.5 to 3.0 feet and are on flood plains."

These soils typically have a slowly pervious layer within the upper 1 meter that keeps the soil wet close enough to the surface for long enough periods that planting or harvesting operations are adversely affected on some areas during prolonged wet periods."
