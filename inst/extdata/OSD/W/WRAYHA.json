  "OVERVIEW": "The Wrayha series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum derived from shale.  Wrayha soils are on mesas, benches, ridges, and side slopes.  Slopes are 3 to 65 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F, and mean summer soil temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F.  The moisture control section is dry for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to June 30 when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  It is not dry in all parts of the moisture control section for as long as 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice to October 20 and for as long as 90 cumulative days during the period.  Clay percentage in the particle-size control section ranges from 36 to 50 percent.  Depth to calcareous material is usually 3 to 8 inches but some pedons may be calcareous to the surface.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is less than 12 percent.  Some pedons have visible secondary lime occurring as soft masses.  Rock fragments are mainly pebbles and range from 0 to 20 percent in the A horizon.  Stones are largely on the surface.  Rock fragments in the C horizon range from 0 to 10 percent and are mainly pebble size and shale channers.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Stony and gravelly modifiers are common.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  Some pedons in the lower C horizon have variegated colors to 10YR hue.  Some pedons have a paralithic contact at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

Gunsone soils have hue of 5YR or redder throughout. Rhoamett soils are moist in the soil moisture control section in the period May 15 through June 30."
