  "OVERVIEW": "The Wolf Point series consists of very deep, well and moderately well drained soils formed in calcareous clayey alluvium on flood plains and low terraces.  These soils have slow permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 14 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
