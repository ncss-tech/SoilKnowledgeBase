  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free calcium carbonate typically is 26 inches and ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 8 to 20 inches and extends into the Bw horizon of most pedons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam and ranges from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4, and is silty clay loam or silt loam averaging between 25 and 35 percent clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  It has common to many accumulations of calcium carbonate.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons have 2Bk horizons of clay loam glacial till below depths of 40 inches.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4, and is silt loam or silty clay loam.  Thin strata of loam or sandy loam are in some pedons.  The stratified materials typically extend to depths of 5 feet or more.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have 2C horizons of clay loam glacial till at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Stones and pebbles are common in some pedons.  There is considerable variation in mottling and iron staining."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wentworth soils are nearly level to rolling on uplands.  Surfaces are plane to convex, and slope gradients range from 0 to 9 percent.  These soils formed in silty glacial drift.  In some areas glacial till is at 40 to 60 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches."

Egan soils are on higher parts of the landscape.  Chancellor, Trent, Viborg, and Whitewood soils are in the swales.  Chancellor soils are wetter and have a fine-textured argillic horizon.  Trent, Viborg, and Whitewood soils have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick.  The Beadle, Ethan, Shindler, and Steinauer soils formed in glacial till and are on convex slopes in the more undulating areas.  Clarno soils have a fine-loamy control section and are on the convex to plane slopes of the landscape. Huntimer soils have a fine textured control section and are on slightly higher landscapes.  Wakonda soils have a calcic horizon and are at edges of swales and depressions."

Permeability of the glacial till is moderately slow. The moderately well drained phase has a perched water table  at a depth of 3 to 6 feet from October to July in most years."
