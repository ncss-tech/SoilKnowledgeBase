Egan soils are on higher parts of the landscape.  Chancellor, Trent, Viborg, and Whitewood soils are in the swales.  Chancellor soils are wetter and have a fine-textured argillic horizon.  Trent, Viborg, and Whitewood soils have mollic epipedons greater than 20 inches thick.  The Beadle, Ethan, Shindler, and Steinauer soils formed in glacial till and are on convex slopes in the more undulating areas.  Clarno soils have a fine-loamy control section and are on the convex to plane slopes of the landscape. Huntimer soils have a fine textured control section and are on slightly higher landscapes.  Wakonda soils have a calcic horizon and are at edges of swales and depressions."
