  "OVERVIEW": "The Wolot series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in silty volcanic ash over a buried soil that formed in loess and colluvium. Wolot soils are on foot slopes, toeslopes and fans of hills and mountains. Slopes are 0 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the ashy materials and depth to the buried soil is 20 to 40 inches. The buried argillic horizon (2Btb) is within a depth of 50 inches.  The thickness of the solum within the volcanic ash mantle is 10 to 22 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe 2Bwb and 2Btb horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel in the 2Btb horizon."
