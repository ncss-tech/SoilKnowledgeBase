    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: These soils have a bulk density of 0.65 to 0.85g per cubic centimeter in the ashy overlay with estimated phosphate retention of more than 25 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of more than 0.4 percent, and 15-bar moisture of less than 12 percent based on air-dried sample. The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 50 degrees F. The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days following the summer solstice. Thickness of the ashy materials and depth to the buried soil is 20 to 40 inches. The buried argillic horizon (2Btb) is within a depth of 50 inches.  The thickness of the solum within the volcanic ash mantle is 10 to 22 inches. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam with 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe C horizon has value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry, chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.\nThe 2Bwb and 2Btb horizons have value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent gravel in the 2Btb horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wolot soils are on foot slopes, toeslopes and fans of hills and mountains.  Elevations are 1,900 to 3,900 feet. Slope is 0 to 30 percent. These soils formed in silty volcanic ash deposited over older loess and colluvium. The climate is characterized by cool wet winters and hot dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 15 to 25 inches The mean annual temperature is 45 to 48 degrees F. The frost-free period is 100 to 150 days."
