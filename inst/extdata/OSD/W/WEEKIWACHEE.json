  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Sulfur content ranges from 0.75 to 4.0 percent or more above the Cr horizon.  The organic layers in all tiers are dominantly sapric material, but in some pedons wood chunks occur.  Combined thickness of the Oa and C horizons over the Cr horizon is highly variable but is dominantly 30 to 40 inches.  Depth to the R horizon is commonly 40 to 51 inches but frequently ranges to 60 inches or more.  Conductivity of the saturation extract above the Cr horizon ranges from about 16 to 45 mmho/cm.  Reaction in water in the natural state ranges from slightly acid to moderately alkaline in the Oa and C horizons; after air drying the pH in 0.01M calcium chloride ranges from 4.5 to 5.5 except the Oa1 horizon which ranges to 7.3.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 or less, and chroma of 3 or less.  Unrubbed fiber content ranges from about 6 to 30 percent and is less than 5 percent rubbed.  Mineral content ranges from about 26 percent to 80 percent but is dominantly less than 65 percent.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or less, and chroma of 2 or less with or without mottles or streaks of gray or brown.  Texture is mucky sand, mucky fine sand, sand, or fine sand.  Organic matter content ranges from about 2 to 20 percent.\nThe Cr horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 7 or 8, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Hard limestone fragments occur randomly throughout the horizon and range from about 20 to 35 percent by volume.  Solution holes in this layer range from none to about three in each pedon and, where present, are filled with sandy mineral material and hard limestone fragments."

They formed in moderately thick deposits of hydrophytic plant remains and sandy marine sediments overlying soft and hard limestone.  Near the type location, rainfall averages about 50 to 60 inches annually with mean annual air temperature of 70 to 74 degrees F."
