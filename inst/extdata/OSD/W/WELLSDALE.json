Slopes are 2 to 30 percent. Elevation is 200 to 700 feet. The soils formed in colluvium and residuum derived from marine tuffaceous sandstone and siltstone of the Spencer Formation. The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The average January temperature is 39 to 40 degrees F. and the average July temperature is 65 to 67 degrees F. The frost-free season is 165 to 210 days."

Bellpine soils are fine-textured, 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, have less than 35 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon, and occur on adjacent higher foothills. Carlton soils have a mollic epipedon and occur on adjacent foot slopes and low terraces. Chehulpum soils are less than 20 inches deep to a paralithic contact, and occur on low hills and foothills. Dupee soils are somewhat poorly drained, fine textured, and occur in the most concave part of drainageways. Hazelair soils are very fine textured, lack an argillic horizon and occur on low hills and foothills. Jory soils have hue redder than 7.5YR, are fine textured have less than 35 percent base saturation in the argillic horizon, and occur on adjacent higher foothills. Panther soils are poorly drained, very fine textured, and occur in swales and concave drainageways on low hills and foothills. Sitton soils do not have iron depletions or concentrations within 40 inches of the soil surface. Steiwer soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact, have a mollic epipedon 10 to 20 inches thick, and occur on low hills and foothills. Willakenzie soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact and occur on low hills."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - from the soil surface to a depth of 24 inches (A1, A2, BA horizons)\nArgillic horizon - from a depth of 24 to 65 inches (Bt1, Bt2 and BCt horizons)\nAquultic feature - redox depletions with chroma of 2 or less within 75 cm of the mineral soil surface and base saturation (sum of cations) of less than 75 percent in one or more subhorizons within the upper 75 cm of the argillic horizon (Bt1 horizon)\nParticle-size control section - from depths of 24 to 44 inches (Bt1, and part of the Bt2 horizon)\nThis soil was previously recognized as the Veneta Series, Loamy Subsoil Variant in the Benton County Area Soil Survey report. Field observations and documentation from several counties in the MLRA 2 Willamette Valley update area indicate the Wellsdale soils occur more extensively than was previously recognized. Wellsdale soils occur on the Dolph and Brateng geomorphic surfaces.\nDepths to diagnostic horizons and features start from the mineral soil surface.\nDue to further field investigations, the type location for the series has been moved to Yamhill County, Oregon to reflect the current central concept.\nClassification revised 01/2002 to reflect active mineralogy.\nThis revision is based on extensive lab data on Wellsdale and associated Willakenzie series on the same geology.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Characterization data of 5 pedons from the National Soil Survey Lab with User Pedon ID #s: 62OR071009, 62OR071010, 01OR071005, 01OR071006, 01OR071012, 01OR071013, and 01OR071014.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
