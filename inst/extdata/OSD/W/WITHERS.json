  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 60 to 65 degrees F.  The soils are saturated at some depth between 24 and 48 inches for short periods in the spring and early summer.  The total cumulative time is more than 90 days.  The soils between are usually moist and between depths of 4 and 12 inches become dry for at least 45 consecutive days in mid and late summer, unless irrigated.  The sola is 17 to 42 inches thick.  Between depth of 10 inches and the underlying sand layers, the soil is silty clay loam or clay loam containing 27 to 35 percent clay, more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand, and less than 15 percent coarse fragments by weighted average.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nThe lower part of the B2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B horizon has weak or moderate subangular blocky structure.  Depth to mottles ranges from 18 to 27 inches."

The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free season is 100 to 110 days."
