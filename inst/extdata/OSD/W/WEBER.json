  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to uniformly calcareous material normally ranges from 8 to 35 inches and is not shallower than the upper 3 inches of the B2t horizon.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal IIC horizon ranges from 20 to nearly 40 inches.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 17 to nearly 40 inches.  Depth to continuous subhorizons of visible secondary calcium carbonate and/or sulfate ranges from 12 to 50 inches.  The control section of some pedons contains few faint mottles, not due to segregation of lime, and has a chroma of more than 2 in both matrix and mottling. Rock fragments range from 0 to 10 percent by volume in most subhorizons of the solum and range dominantly in size from 1/2 to 10 inches.  A majority of subhorizons in the solum and any C horizon above the contrasting substratum have hue of 5YR or redder.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma from 1 through 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 10R, value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 1 through 6. It is typically loam, clay loam or silty clay loam, but clay ranges from 18 to 35 percent, silt 5 to 65 percent, and sand 10 to 70 percent.  This horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline (1:5 dilution unbuffered organic dye).  Calcium carbonate of the fine earth in the lower part of the solum or any C horizon above the contrasting substratum ranges from 3 to 14 percent."

The soil formed in moderately thin calcareous reddish brown eolian materials overlying beds of sandy and gravelly alluvium or outwash.  At the type location, the mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches with nearly equal precipitation in all months.  Mean annual temperature is 45 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 63 degrees F."
