  "OVERVIEW": "The Walville series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from tuff breccia.  walville soils are on uplands at elevations of 400 to l,800 feet.  Slopes range from 8 to 90 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 80 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

Bunker and Kinney soils have l5 to 35 percent hard unweathered rock fragments in the control section.  Elochoman soils lack pebble or cobble size fragments in the control section.  Lytell, Swem, and Zenker soils have more than 35 percent soft weathered siltstone and sandstone fragments in the control section.  Silcox soils have fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the control section."
