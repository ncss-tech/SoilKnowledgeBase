All of these soils lack 35 to 60 percent soft weathered tuff breccia fragments in the particle-size control section.  Also, AStoria and Boistfort soils have silty clay or clay lower B horizons.  Bunker and Kinney soils have l5 to 35 percent hard unweathered rock fragments in the control section.  Elochoman soils lack pebble or cobble size fragments in the control section.  Lytell, Swem, and Zenker soils have more than 35 percent soft weathered siltstone and sandstone fragments in the control section.  Silcox soils have fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the control section."
