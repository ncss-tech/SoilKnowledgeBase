    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Walstead soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, moraines, outwash terraces, eskers and glaciated mountain slopes.  Elevations are 2,790 to 5,000 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in calcareous till or alluvium.  The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; moist springs; and warm summers.  Mean annual precipitation is 17 to 25 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 110 days."
