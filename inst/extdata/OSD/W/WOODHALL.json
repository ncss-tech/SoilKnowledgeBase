  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodhall series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium, colluvium or slide deposits derived from igneous and sedimentary rock. These soils are on mountain slopes, dip slopes, structural benches, hills and landslides. Slopes are 3 to 65 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 585 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
