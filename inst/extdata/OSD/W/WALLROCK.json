  "OVERVIEW": "The Wallrock series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium. Wallrock soils are in concave areas and drainageways of mountainsides and foothills. Slopes are 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 17 inches. The mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

Depth to continuous horizons of calcium carbonate accumulation is usually 40 to 48 inches but ranges to 35 inches. The lower boundary of the Bt horizon ranges in depth from 15 to 30 inches. The mean annual soil temperature is 39 degrees to 42 degrees F. Rock fragments less than 3 inches in size range from 0 to 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is loam or sandy loam. This horizon is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam, and has 18 to 35 percent clay. This horizon has few or common strong brown mottles. It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe BC and Ck horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR. It is neutral or slightly alkaline."
