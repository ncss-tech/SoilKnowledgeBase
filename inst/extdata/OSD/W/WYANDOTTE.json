  "REVDATE": "03/2000",
  "STATES": "MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyandotte series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in a coarse textured mantle overlying clayey till or lacustrine sediments on level glacial lake plains.  These soils have rapid permeability in the solum and slow in the underlying material.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual air temperature is 41 degrees F.",
