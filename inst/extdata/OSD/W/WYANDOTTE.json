    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the mollic epipedon and depth to the 2C horizon ranges from 7 to 14 inches.  Depth to the 3Cg horizon ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The 2C horizon has 35 to 75 percent rock fragments and the 3Cg horizon has less than 15 percent.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is clay loam, loam or sandy clay loam.  It is friable or very friable and slightly or moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an Ak horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or sandy clay loam.  It is friable or very friable.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizons have value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 0 to 2.  Distinct and prominent redoximorphic features are present.  They are very gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly loamy coarse sand, very gravelly sand or very gravelly coarse sand.  They are very friable or loose.  They are neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 3Cg horizons have value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are present.  They are clay, clay loam, silty clay loam or silty clay.  They have 35 to 80 percent clay.  They are firm or very firm and are slightly or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wyandotte soils are level and nearly level and formed dominantly in 20 to 40 inches of gravelly sediments overlying clayey till or lacustrine sediments.  These materials are of the late Wisconsinan age.  Typically these soils occur on slightly concave broad flats adjacent to beach ridges.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 42 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 22 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Clearwater, Lohnes, Syrene and Thiefriver soils.  The Clearwater soils are clayey throughout the profile.  Lohnes soils are well drained and sandy throughout.  Syrene soils are deeper than 40 inches to sand and gravel and do not have a clayey substratum.  Thiefriver soils occur on similar landscape positions."
