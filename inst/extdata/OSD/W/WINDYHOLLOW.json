  "OVERVIEW": "The Windyhollow series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  Windyhollow soils are on marine terraces and associated side slopes and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees.",

The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 19 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1.

Biaggi, Bruhel, Cabrillo, Crispin, Flumeville and Mallopass soils are also on marine terraces.  Biaggi, Bruhel, Crispin and Mallopass soils are often in slightly higher positions.  Biaggi soils are moderately deep to lithic contact.  Bruhel soils lack mottling, and have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Crispin soils lack mottling, and are moderately deep to a cemented pan.  Mallopass soils have mottles below 50 inches, and have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Cabrillo soils have a loamy sand umbric epipedon.  Flumeville soils are often in subtle depressions, have mottles between 10 and 30 inches, and have a fine particle-size control section.  Stornetta soils occur on flood plains, have mottles above 10 inches, and lack argillic horizons."
