    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Thickness of the mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  Organic carbon content ranges from 0.6 to 4.0 percent decreasing regularly with depth.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature ranges from 6 to 9 degrees F.  The soil between the depths of 6 and 19 inches is moist in all parts from November 1 to June 1.  It is dry in some or all parts from July 1 to October 1 in most years.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 35 percent clay.\nThe A horizon is 10YR 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/2 or 5/3.  Moist color is 10YR 2/1, 2/2, 3/1, 3/2 or 3/3; clay content is 20 to 27 percent.  Hard gravel content ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 50 to 70 percent.  Reaction is strongly or moderately acid.\nThe Bt horizon is 2.5Y 7/2, 8/2; 10YR 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 8/2 or 8/3.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/4, 6/4, 7/4; 10YR 4/4, 5/3, 5/4, 6/3 or 6/4.  Mottle colors are 10YR 6/6 or 6/8.  Moist mottle colors are 10YR 5/6, 5/8 or 7.5YR 5/8.  Colors with chromas of 2 occur with mottles between the depths of 30 and 50 inches and continue to a depth of 60 inches or more.   The Bt horizon is a gravelly clay loam, clay loam or clay.  Clay content ranges from 27 to 45 percent.  Hard gravel content ranges from 5 to 30 percent.  Base saturation (ammonium acetate) ranges from 70 to 100 percent.  Reaction is moderately or slightly acid."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Windyhollow soils occur on marine terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  Elevations are 80 to 900 feet.  The soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources.  The climate is humid with cool foggy summers and cool moist winters.  A strong marine influence limits the diurnal and annual range of temperature.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches.  Mean January temperature is 48 degrees F., mean July temperature is 57 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is 53 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 250 to 330 days."

Biaggi, Bruhel, Cabrillo, Crispin, Flumeville and Mallopass soils are also on marine terraces.  Biaggi, Bruhel, Crispin and Mallopass soils are often in slightly higher positions.  Biaggi soils are moderately deep to lithic contact.  Bruhel soils lack mottling, and have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Crispin soils lack mottling, and are moderately deep to a cemented pan.  Mallopass soils have mottles below 50 inches, and have a thicker mollic epipedon.  Cabrillo soils have a loamy sand umbric epipedon.  Flumeville soils are often in subtle depressions, have mottles between 10 and 30 inches, and have a fine particle-size control section.  Stornetta soils occur on flood plains, have mottles above 10 inches, and lack argillic horizons."

The saturated zone starts between the depths of 30 and 50 inches and extends to greater than 60 inches.  Surface runoff under bare soil conditions is very slow through rapid.  Permeability is moderately slow."
