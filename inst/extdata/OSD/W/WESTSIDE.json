  "OVERVIEW": "The Westside series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess over alluvium derived from tuff and basalt.  Westside soils are on high lake terraces or tablelands.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",

There is an absolute increase of clay of 15 to 25 percent between the A and the 2Bt horizons.  Depth to the hard, firm and brittle layer is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 25 to 45 rock fragments with 5 to 30 percent cobbles and 10 to 40 percent gravel.  It has 10 to 20 percent clay.  It is 7 to 15 inches thick.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter (xerollic).\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is cobbly silty clay loam or cobbly clay.  It has 15 to 30 percent rock fragments primarily cobbles and 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3  moist and dry.
