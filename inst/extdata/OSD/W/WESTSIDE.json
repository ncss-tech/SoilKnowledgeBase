    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are dry for more than half the time when soil temperature is greater than 41 degrees F.  The soil temperature is above 41 degrees F. from about March 15 to about November 15.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The particle-size control section averages 35 to 45 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent rock fragments, primarily cobbles.  Depth to bedrock or an indurated pan is over 60 inches.  There is an absolute increase of clay of 15 to 25 percent between the A and the 2Bt horizons.  Depth to the hard, firm and brittle layer is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 25 to 45 rock fragments with 5 to 30 percent cobbles and 10 to 40 percent gravel.  It has 10 to 20 percent clay.  It is 7 to 15 inches thick.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter (xerollic).\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  It is cobbly silty clay loam or cobbly clay.  It has 15 to 30 percent rock fragments primarily cobbles and 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe 3Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 3  moist and dry.  It is very cobbly or very stony silty clay loam or clay loam.  It has 35 to 50 percent rock fragments and 30 to 40 percent clay.\nThe 4Bkq horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6 moist, 7 or 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is extremely cobbly loam or extremely stony loam.  It has 60 to 80 percent rock fragments."

These soils formed in loess over alluvium from basalt and tuff.  They are typically on the leeward (southwest) side of high intermittent lake basins.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days."
