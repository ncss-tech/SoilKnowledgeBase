  "OVERVIEW": "The Womack series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately\nslowly permeable soils that are formed in mixed alluvium with some\nloess influence.  They are on coalesced fan terraces and fan\npediments.  Slopes are 1 to 8 percent.  The average annual\nprecipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual temperature is\nabout 46 degrees F.",
