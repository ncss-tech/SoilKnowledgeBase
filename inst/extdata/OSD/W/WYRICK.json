  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Brocket, Claiborne, Nolichucky, and Trimble series are in the same family.  Brocket soils developed in residuum of sandstone and have sandstone rock fragments in the solum.  Claiborne and Nolichucky soils have 5YR or redder subsoils. Nolichucky soils developed in alluvium and contain rounded fragments of sandstone and quartzite.  Trimble soils developed in residuum of limestone and have limestone rock fragments in the solum that have not been worn by water or soil creep."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wyrick soils formed in colluvial and alluvial materials weathered dominantly from limestone with inclusions of shale, siltstone, and fine-grained sandstone over residuum in limestone valleys.  Wyrick soils are in gently sloping to moderately steep concave upland drainageways, toeslopes, sinks, and saddles in the Ridge and Valley province.  Slopes range from 2 to 25 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 55 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 42 inches."

Austinville and Groseclose soils have more clay in the subsoil and are on convex summits and backslopes.  Chiswell and Litz soils are shallower to bedrock and are on convex summits and backslopes.  Marbie soils have a fragipan and are on similar landscape positions.  Wurno soils are shallower to bedrock and are on summits and backslopes."
