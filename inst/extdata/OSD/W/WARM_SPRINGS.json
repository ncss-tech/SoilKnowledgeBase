  "OVERVIEW": "The Warm Springs series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed rocks.  Warm Springs soils are on low lake terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (A horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 8 to 37 inches (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 24 and 40 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bk3 and C horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bk2 and Bk3 horizons and parts of the Bk1 and C horizons).\nThe revision of November 2005 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Calciustolls based on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.  There are about 1,700 acres of Warm Springs soils in the Soil Survey of Cibola Area, New Mexico (NM682) that need correlation to another series.\nThe active cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification in December 2002 based on soil property data."

The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste."
