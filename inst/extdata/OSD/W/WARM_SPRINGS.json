  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Warm Springs soils are on low lake terraces.  These soils formed in lacustrine deposits derived from mixed sedimentary and igneous rocks. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The climate is dry subhumid.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F., the mean summer temperature is 68 to 73 degrees F., and the frost-free period is 130 to 180 days."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; low or medium surface runoff; moderate to slow permeability (high to moderately low saturated hydraulic conductivity).  Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 2.0 and 3.3 feet (moderately deep free water occurrence class) between April and September.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Warm Springs soils are used for pasture, and for cultivated crops under irrigation when drained.  Principal uses are for growing small grains, sugar beets, alfalfa, tomatoes, and improved pasture.  The dominant native vegetation is black greasewood, alkali sacaton, alkali bluegrass, inland saltgrass, and foxtail barley."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 8 inches (A horizon).\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 8 to 37 inches (Bk1, Bk2, and Bk3 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 24 and 40 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the Bk3 and C horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (Bk2 and Bk3 horizons and parts of the Bk1 and C horizons).\nThe revision of November 2005 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-loamy, mixed, active, mesic Aquic Calciustolls based on the assumed moisture regime being xeric instead of ustic.  There are about 1,700 acres of Warm Springs soils in the Soil Survey of Cibola Area, New Mexico (NM682) that need correlation to another series.\nThe active cation exchange activity class was added to the taxonomic classification in December 2002 based on soil property data.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  The typical pedon at the series type location has partial characterization data by the Soils Laboratory from Utah State University (USU) Logan, UT and is published on pages 144-145, Table 11 of the Soil Survey of Davis-Weber Area, Utah.  The pH values in the typical pedon are from saturated paste.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
