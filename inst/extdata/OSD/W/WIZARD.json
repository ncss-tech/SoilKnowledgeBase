    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the ash mantle and depth to glacial outwash material (2Bwb horizon) is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. The ash mantle (A horizon) contains 50 to 70 percent glass and glass-coated aggregates, phosphate retention of 75 to 85 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 1.5 to 2.5 percent, and the 15-bar water content on dried and undried samples is 8 to 12 percent.  The glacial outwash material has andic soil properties and has 15-bar water content of less 12 percent on dried samples.  The particle-size control section averages 10 to 25 percent coarse fragments with the upper part (ash mantle) having less than 10 percent coarse fragments.  The soil is usually moist, but is dry in all parts for 60 to 90 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 16 inches thick.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches thick except where disturbed.\nThe A horizons have 5 to 15 percent clay (estimated).  It has 0 to 10 percent subrounded gravel.  It is slightly acid or neutral.  Base saturation is 40 to 50 percent by ammonium acetate.\nThe 2Bwb horizon has distinct to prominent mottles.  It has 10 to 20 percent clay (estimated).  It is cobbly sandy loam or loam or very cobbly sandy loam or loam.  It has 5 to 25 percent subrounded gravel, 10 to 35 percent subrounded cobbles and 0 to 15 percent subrounded stones.  Total rock fragments range from 15 to 60 percent."
