  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wendane soils are on alluvial flats, stream terraces, and flood plains.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, loess, and volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  Elevations range from 1,220 to 1,950 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 120 days."

Batan soils are not saturated within 100 cm of the soil surface at some period in the year.  Bubus soils are coarse-loamy and do not have endosaturation.  Reese soils are fine-loamy.  Sonoma soils are poorly drained and do not have horizons with durinodes."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm (A1, A2 and part of the C horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade feature - The zone from 33 to 69 cm (Cqk1 and Cqk2 horizons).\nDurinodes - The zone from 33 to 69 cm (Cqk1 and Cqk2 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 70 and 100 cm at certain times during normal years (parts of the Ck horizon).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (Cqk1, Cqk2, Ck and part of the C horizons).\nThe revision of February 2007 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Duric Halaquepts.  The revision of April 2003 updated the taxonomic class from Fine-silty, mixed, superactive, calcareous, mesic Aeric Halaquepts.  Future study is needed to determine the typical amount of volcanic glass in this soil and whether a change in the taxonomic class to Ashy, glassy, calcareous, mesic Aquandic Halaquepts represents the central concept as mapped in most of the series extent.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon sampled as Wendane about 2 miles southeast of the series type location and in the same map unit has full characterization data by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S83NV-015-003 (pedon # 83P0867).  This lab pedon has high content of volcanic glass (ranges from 35 to 90 percent) in all horizons.\nPrevious authors and editors include: GJS-CEJ-RLB.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
