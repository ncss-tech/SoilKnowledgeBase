  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils are moist in the winter and spring and are dry for 60 to 100 consecutive days after the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The base saturation (sum of cations) throughout the upper 30 inches is 50 to 75 percent.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 30 percent rock fragments and 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 when moist and 4 or 5 when dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 when moist and 3 or 4 when dry.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4  moist and dry.  It is clay loam and clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent of which 0 to 15 percent are  cobbles and stones and 0 to 20 percent are gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Woodchopper soils are on rolling plateaus and tablelands at elevations of 5,500 to 7,200 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 40 percent.  The soils formed in residuum and colluvium primarily from andesite, basalt and tuff.  The climate is characterized by cool moist winters and warm dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 28 to 32 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 43 to 45 degrees.  The frost-free period is 30 to 50 days."

The Mound soil is clayey-skeletal in the particle-size control section.  The Polander soil is ashy in the particle-size control section and lacks a mollic epipedon.  Rogger soils are loamy-skeletal in the particle-size control section and have a mollic epipedon 10 to 16 inches thick. Sherval soils are loamy-skeletal in the particle-size control section and are moderately well drained.  Winterim soils are clayey-skeletal in the particle-size control section and have montmorillonitic mineralogy."
