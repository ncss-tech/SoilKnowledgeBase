  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodchopper series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium primarily from andesite, basalt and tuff.  Woodchopper soils are on rolling plateaus and tablelands with slopes of 0 to 40 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 45 to 47 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 30 inches thick.  The base saturation (sum of cations) throughout the upper 30 inches is 50 to 75 percent.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 30 percent rock fragments and 35 to 50 percent clay.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 when moist and 4 or 5 when dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 when moist and 3 or 4 when dry.\nThe Bt horizon has a hue of 7.5YR, 5YR, or 2.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4  moist and dry.  It is clay loam and clay.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent of which 0 to 15 percent are  cobbles and stones and 0 to 20 percent are gravel."
