  "OVERVIEW": "The Witknee series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on alluvial terraces of mountain valleys.  Witknee soils formed in floodplain sediments from mixed lithology, dominated by volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and the mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.",
