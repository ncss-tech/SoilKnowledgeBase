  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The mineralogy of the soil is mixed; the mean annual soil temperature is approximately 60 to 65 degrees F.; the soil is usually dry but moist for 90 consecutive days between depths of 5 to 15 inches during winter rainy season; the soil is dry for 60 consecutive days after June 21 between a depth of 5 to 15 inches.\nThe A horizons range in color from pale brown, light brownish gray to gray (10YR 6/2, 6/3, 7/2, 7/3); in texture from very fine sandy loam to silt loam, usually over 50 percent silt and less than 18 percent clay.  They are strongly alkaline, calcareous and saline-alkali.\nThe C horizons are the same color as the A horizons or may range to yellowish brown (10YR 5/6).  The texture is fine sandy loam, usually over 50 percent silt and less than 18 percent clay and may be stratified at depths greater than 30 inches.  The reaction is moderately to very strongly alkaline and the soils are saline-alkali and calcareous."
