  "OVERVIEW": "The Walkerwells series consists of very deep well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone. Walkerwells soils are on flood plains and in drainageways. Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 65 degrees F. (18 degrees C) and the mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches (330 mm).",
