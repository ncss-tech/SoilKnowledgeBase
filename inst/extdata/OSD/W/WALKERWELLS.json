    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Walkerwells soils are on floodplains and in drainageways in karst.  They formed in alluvium derived from sandstone with influence from rock gypsum.  Slope gradient ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 5,500 feet (1,219 to 1,676 m).  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches (305 to 406 mm). The mean annual air temperature is 62 to 67 degrees F. (17 to 19 degrees C). The frost-free period is about 210 to 250 days."

Dellahunt soils have a gypsic horizon within 40 inches (100 cm) of the surface and occur higher in the landscape.  Elcor, Hollebeke, and Neimahr soils have a lithic contact within 20 inches (50 cm) of the surface and occur higher in the landscape.  Hollomex soils have hypergypsic mineralogy and occur higher in the landscape.  Hollebeke, Joberanch, and Pokorny soils have a petrogypsic horizon and occur higher in the landscape."
