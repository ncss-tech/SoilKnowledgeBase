    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development ranges from 61 to 114 cm (24 to 45 inches). Depth to carbonates is typically 64 to 89 cm (25 to 35 inches), but it ranges from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). The depth to horizons averaging more than 15 percent sand ranges from 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). The particle-size control section averages 27 to 35 percent clay.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Hue tends to become more yellow as depth increases. Redoximorphic features have chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt, 2BCt, or 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Redoximorphic features have chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. The horizon is commonly stratified and sometimes contains strata of loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. It is silt loam, sandy loam, loam, or loamy sand (including coarse, fine, or very fine analogs where appropriate) and is commonly stratified. Coarse fragments average less than 15 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Wauconda soils are on lake plains or outwash plains of Wisconsin age. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The soils formed in 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) of silty material and in the underlying stratified calcareous outwash. Climate is continental. Summer is hot and winter is cold. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C (45 to 52 degrees F.), mean annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 1020 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost free days range from 140 to 180 days, and elevation ranges from 183 to 311 meters (600 to 1,020 feet) above sea level."

Aptakisic soils have lighter colored surface layers and Mundelein soils have a mollic epipedon. The moderately well drained Gray soils are on higher positions on the landform. The poorly drained Pella soils are in lower lying drainageways."

An apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 15 to 61 cm (0.5 foot to 2 feet) at some time during the spring in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is low to medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."
