  "STATES": "IL,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wauconda series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils on outwash plains and lake plains. These soils developed in loess or silty material and in the underlying calcareous loamy outwash. Slope range is 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm (35 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Hue tends to become more yellow as depth increases. Redoximorphic features have chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt, 2BCt, or 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Redoximorphic features have chroma of 1 to 8. Texture is silt loam, loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. The horizon is commonly stratified and sometimes contains strata of loamy sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 to 8. It is silt loam, sandy loam, loam, or loamy sand (including coarse, fine, or very fine analogs where appropriate) and is commonly stratified. Coarse fragments average less than 15 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
