  "OVERVIEW": "The Wolco series is a member of the fine, mixed, thermic family\nof Pachic Argiustolls.  These soils have a dark gray silty clay\nloam A horizon, a very dark grayish brown silty clay loam B1\nhorizon, and coarsely mottled brownish or reddish silty clay B2t\nhorizons that are underlain by hard limestone at a depth of 55\ninches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness and depth to hard\nlimestone or chert bedrock range from 40 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon is very dark grayish brown (10YR 3/2), dark gray (N\n4/ ; 10YR 4/1), or dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2).  It is silt loam\nor silty clay loam and medium acid or slightly acid.\nThe B1 horizon is brown to dark brown (7.5YR 4/2), very dark\ngrayish brown (10YR 3/2), or dark  grayish brown (10YR 4/2).\nSome pedons have a B1 horizon with mottles of red or brown.  It is\nmedium acid or slightly acid.\nThe B2t horizons are dark reddish gray (5YR 4/2), reddish brown\n(5YR 4/3, 5/3, 4/4, 5/4), yellowish red (5YR 4/6, 5/6), or brown\nor dark brown (7.5YR 4/2, 5/2, 4/4, 5/4).  Mottles of gray, brown,\nor red occur in most pedons.  Some matrix colors are coarsely\nmottled.  These horizons are silty clay loam or silty clay with\nthe clay content of the control section ranging from 35 to 50\npercent.  Fragments of limestone or chert and calcium carbonate\nconcretions from 2 mm. to 75 mm. in diameter, make up from 0 to 15\npercent by volume.  Fragments of limestone or chert greater than\n75 mm. in diameter make up from 0 to 10 percent by volume.  The\nB2t horizons range from medium acid to moderately alkaline.\nSome pedons have B3 horizons that have color, texture, and content\nof fragments similar to the B2t horizons.  The B3 horizon ranges\nfrom neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe R layer is hard limestone and is fractured at intervals from 1\nto 6 feet.\nCompeting Series:  These are the Abilene,\nBlanket, Brewer, Corbin, Cutter, Dale, Dodson, Grant, Kingfisher,\nMcLain, Pond Creek, St. Paul, Scullin, and Vanoss series.\nAbilene, Blanket, Brewer, Cutter, Dodson, and McLain soils are\nmore than 60 inches thick to bedrock.  Corbin, Pond Creek and St.\nPaul soils have sola more than 60 inches thick and lack wetness\nmottles within 1 to 2 feet of the soil surface.  Dale soils lack\nB2t horizons.  Grant, Kingfisher, Scullin, and Vanoss soils have\nmollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  In addition, Scullin\nsoils have sola 20-40 inches thick over limestone bedrock."

Average annual\nprecipitation ranges from 32 to 40 inches; mean annual temperature\nranges from 57 degrees to 64 degrees F.; Thornthwaite P-E indices\nrange from 54 to 64.
