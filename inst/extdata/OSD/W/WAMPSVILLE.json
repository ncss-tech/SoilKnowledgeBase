  "OVERVIEW": "The Wampsville series consists of very deep, well drained soils on glacial outwash alluvial fans and glaciofluvial deposits of terraces, valley trains, and kames. They are nearly level to very steep soils formed in materials in which reddish shale is a significant component, with limestone, sandstone, and some grayish shale. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is 48 degrees F. and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

Coarse fragments, dominantly limestone and sandstone gravel and cobblestones and reddish and greenish-gray shale fragments, range from 10 to 35 percent by volume in the solum and from 25 to 70 percent in the substratum.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2or 3. They are loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. They range from strongly acid through neutral.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 through 4. They are loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak or moderate, fine or medium granular or subangular blocky structure. Consistence is friable. They range from strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Bt/E horizon has colors and textures similar to the Bt and E horizons. It has weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure and friable or firm consistence. They range from strongly acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 2 through 4. It is clay loam or sandy clay loam in the fine earth. It has weak or moderate, medium or coarse subangular blocky structure and friable or firm consistence. It ranges from moderately acid through moderately alkaline, with pH increasing with depth.\nThe BC horizon is similar in color to the Bt horizon. The BC horizon is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction. It has weak medium or coarse subangular blocky structure and friable or firm consistence. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline, and free carbonates may be present.\nThe C horizons are variable in color, ranging in hue from 2.5YR through 2.5Y, depending on stratification and lithochromic effects of the shale. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through moderately alkaline."

All of these soils lack the sorted and stratified materials in the lower part of the series control section of the Wampsville soils.\nThe Belmore, Chili, Conotton, Howard, Kars, and Palmyra series are members of other families. Belmore and Chili soils lack interfingering of albic material into the argillic horizon. Conotton, Howard, and Kars soils have loamy-skeletal textural control sections. Palmyra soils have contrasting family textures."

    "content": "REMARKS: Wampsville soils were classified as Gray Brown Podzolic soils in the modified 1938 system. The upper 4 inches of the B21t horizon was subdivided into the Bt/E horizon.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are as follows:\n(1) Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\n(2) Argillic horizon - the zone from 12 to 32 inches (Bt/E and Bt horizons).\n(3) Glossic subgroup - as evidenced by interfingering of Albic material around peds in the upper part of the Argillic horizon (Bt/E horizon)."
