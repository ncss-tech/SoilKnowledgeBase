  "OVERVIEW": "The Woolly series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on flood plains.  They formed in alluvium with a high content of rock fragments.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.  Mean annual temperature is about 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: This soil has previously been included with the Cedargap series in mapping.  Diagnostic horizon and features in this pedon include:\n1)  Mollic epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 27 inches.  (A1, A2, and A3 horizons)\n2)  Cumulic feature - the mollic epipedon is more than 24 inches thick.\n3)  Lithic contact - hard dolomite bedrock at 50 inches.\nHydrology and lateral flow of recharge water over dolomite has recycled carbonates to the profile and encouraged a grass understory. This grass understory has influenced the formation of a mollic epipedon in a dominantly forested landscape."
