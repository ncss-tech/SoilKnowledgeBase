    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 44 to 46 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum and depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 40 to 70 inches.  The depth to the contact between the alluvial deposits and the nonconforming residual material is 36 to 60 inches.  The soil moisture control section (10 to 30 inches) is dry in all parts from August 1 to November 1 (90 days) and is moist in some or all parts the rest of the time.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from May 1 to December 1 and exceeds 47 degrees F from June 1 to November 1.  The control section has a weighted average content of 20 to 27 percent clay and 25 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is neutral or slightly acid.  Base saturation ranges from 35 to 50 percent.\nThe A horizon dry color is 7.5YR 4/3, 4/4 or 4/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4; 5YR 3/3, 3/4 or 4/4.  It is loam or sandy loam modified by 5 to 25 percent gravel.  Layers with moist chroma of 3 are less that 7 inches thick.\nThe 3Bt and 4Bt horizons dry colors are 7.5YR 5/6 or 6/6.  Moist colors are 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4, 6/6; 5YR 3/4 or 4/4.  It is stratified with fine earth textures of loam with 20 to 27 percent clay modified by 15 to 60 percent rock fragments mostly cobbles and gravel.\nThe 5Bt horizon dry color is 7.5YR 4/4, 4/6, 5/6 or 6/6.  Moist color is 7.5YR 3/4, 4/4 or 5YR 3/4.  It is loam with 20 to 27 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wafla soils are in basins on lava plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium weathered from basalt and andesite with a small amount of volcanic ash that overlies nonconforming basalt.  Elevation is 4,950 to 5,300 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is about 30 to 40 inches with 60 to 100 inches of snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 44 degrees F, mean July temperature is about 60 degrees F and the mean January temperature is about 26 degrees F.  Frost free period is 60 to 80 days."
