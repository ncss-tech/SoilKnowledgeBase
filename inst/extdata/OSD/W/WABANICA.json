  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of solum ranges from 10 to 24 inches.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 14 inches.  These soils typically have free carbonates throughout, but in some pedons the upper 5 to 10 inches is leached.  These soils have less than 3 percent rock fragments in the solum and C horizon.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 (less than 5.5 dry) and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, clay loam or their mucky analogues.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 or 2.  The range of textures is the same as that for the A horizon.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam or is stratified.  Some pedons have thin strata of clayey material.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
