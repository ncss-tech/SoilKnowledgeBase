  "OVERVIEW": "The Wickware series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in loess and silty slope alluvium on footslopes of valley sides in bedrock controlled uplands.  Permeability is moderate.  Slopes range from 6 to 30 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the silty mantle is more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the argillic horizon is 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon, 1 to 4 inches thick, with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.\nWickware soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6."

Campia soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits and are stratified within a depth of 40 inches.  Dobie soils have a paralithic contact of soft sandstone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Doritty soils are mottled and have a perched seasonal water table.  Otterholt soils have sandy loam glacial till at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Crystal Lake soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits and are stratified within 40 inches.  Seaton soils are mesic.  Spencer soils have redox features, have a perched seasonal water table, and have glacial till at 40 to 60 inches."
