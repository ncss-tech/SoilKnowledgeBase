  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the silty mantle is more than 60 inches.  Thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 50 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the argillic horizon is 18 to 27 percent.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid throughout the pedon, but ranges to neutral in the Ap horizon where the soil is limed.\nThe Ap horizon has value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Uncultivated pedons have an A horizon, 1 to 4 inches thick, with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.\nWickware soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both).  The E part has color and texture like the E horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR and value and chroma of 4 to 6."

Campia soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits and are stratified within a depth of 40 inches.  Dobie soils have a paralithic contact of soft sandstone at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Doritty soils are mottled and have a perched seasonal water table.  Otterholt soils have sandy loam glacial till at a depth of 40 to 60 inches. Crystal Lake soils formed in silty lacustrine deposits and are stratified within 40 inches.  Seaton soils are mesic.  Spencer soils have redox features, have a perched seasonal water table, and have glacial till at 40 to 60 inches."

Wickware soils formed in very deep silty colluvium.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 120 to 135 days. Elevation ranges from 800 to 1,950 feet."

The moderately well drained Doritty soils are in similar or lower positions on the landscape.  The moderately well drained Quarderer soils formed in silty alluvium in lower landscape positions in drainageways."
