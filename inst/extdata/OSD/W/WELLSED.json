  "OVERVIEW": "The Wellsed series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium predominately from granitic rocks. These soils are on old alluvial fans, fan piedmonts and ballenas. Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
