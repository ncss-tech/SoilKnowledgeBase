  "OVERVIEW": "The Wahatoya series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium and residuum from material weathered from conglomeritic sandstone or hard granite.  Wahatoya soils are on mountain slopes and hills.  Slopes range from 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 19 inches and the mean annual temperature is 42 degrees F.",
