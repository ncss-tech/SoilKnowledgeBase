  "OVERVIEW": "The Wayneco series consists of shallow, well drained moderately permeable soils formed in eolian deposits, colluvium and residuum from interbedded sandstone siltstone and shale. These soils are on mesas, benches, and hillsides have slopes of 2 to 30 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
