  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodsfield series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils formed in a silty mantle 14 to 26 inches thick and in the underlying reddish clayey residuum weathered from interbedded shale, siltstone, and sandstone. Permeability is moderate in the silty material and slow in the underlying material. These soils are on summits and benches and have slopes ranging from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

The silty mantle ranges in thickness from 14 to 26 inches. Coarse fragments, mainly thin flat fragments of siltstone and sandstone, commonly are 0 to 5 percent by volume in the A and B horizons and 0 to 15 percent in the 2B and 2C horizons, but soft fragments of shale range up to 60 percent in the 2C horizon. The particle size control section is 35 to 44 percent clay.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 moist (6 or more dry), and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have a thin A horizon that has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 2 or 3. The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. The A horizon and E horizon typically are strongly acid or very strongly acid but range to neutral when limed.\nBE and Bt horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 6. They are silt loam or silty clay loam. They are slightly acid to very strongly acid.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 5YR, 2.5YR, or 10R; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It typically is strongly acid or moderately acid but ranges to mildly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe 2C horizon reflects colors of the bedrock. It has hue of 10R to 5Y or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, chroma of 0 to 6, and is mottled or variegated in some pedons. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay. It is moderately acid to mildly alkaline. The 2Cr horizon is reddish to greenish soft shale or brown to gray soft shale, siltstone, or sandstone."

Estate soils lack a silty upper mantle. Gunlock soils have fragic characteristics at depths of 20 to 34 inches. Jessup soils formed in loess and glacial till. Lamoille soils have 3B horizons within a depth of 40 inches that contain more than 35 percent coarse fragments. Vandalia soils have more than 5 percent coarse fragments in the Bt horizon.

Gilpin soils are fine-loamy, have acid interbedded bedrock within 40 inches, and are on narrow summits and backslopes. Guernsey and Keene soils are moderately well drained and are on similar landscape positions except Guernsey soils are also on steeper hillsides. Rarden soils are moderately well drained, have acid shale within a depth of 40 inches, and are on summits or hillsides. Upshur soils lack the silty mantle and also occur on hillsides. Wellston and Zanesville soils are on similar landscape positions but are fine-silty, and in addition, Zanesville soils have a fragipan."

The CEC activity class placement is based on NASIS data elements for Monroe County, Ohio, and on associated soils, but not on laboratory data. Class placement may be revised in the future when laboratory data are reviewed or become available.\nCompeting series, pedon description (including horizon nomenclature and/or descriptive terms), and other sections on the OSD were not revised.\nDiagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:\na. ochric epipedon - from the surface to a depth of 10 inches (Ap and BE horizons)\nb. argillic horizon - from a depth of about 10 to 50 inches (Bt1, 2Bt2, 2Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons).\nc. Lithologic discontinuity at 20 inches (top of 2Bt2 horizon)\nd. Paralithic contact at 56 inches (top of 2Cr horizon)\nPrevious revision dates: 12/91-ENH, TNR, DRM\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
