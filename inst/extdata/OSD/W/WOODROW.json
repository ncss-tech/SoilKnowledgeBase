  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodrow series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks.  Woodrow soils are on lake terraces, alluvial fans, alluvial flats, floodplains and in narrow alluvial valleys.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
