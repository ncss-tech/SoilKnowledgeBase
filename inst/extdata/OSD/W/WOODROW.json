Calcium carbonate equivalent: 10 to 40 percent but is most commonly 15 to 25 percent; slight accumulations of carbonates occur in some pedons.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: Average 27 to 35 percent\nSand content: Less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser\nA horizon\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist.\nChroma: 2 or 3 .\nReaction: Slightly alkaline through strongly alkaline.\nCalcium carbonate equivalent: Commonly 15 to 25 percent, but can range from 10 to 40 percent.\nC horizon and Ck horizon present in some pedons\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR.\nValue: 6 to 8 dry, 4 to 7 moist.\nChroma: 2 to 4.\nTexture: Dominantly silty clay loam but thin lenses of silt loam, silty clay, clay loam, or clay are common in most pedons.

They formed in alluvium and lacustrine deposits derived from sedimentary and igneous rocks. Elevation ranges from 1,400 to 1,840 meters.  The climate is semiarid. The mean annual temperature ranges from 7 to 11 degrees C. and the mean summer temperature ranges from 18 to 23 degrees C. The frost free period ranges from 100 to 160 days. The average annual precipitation ranges from 200 to 300 mm."
