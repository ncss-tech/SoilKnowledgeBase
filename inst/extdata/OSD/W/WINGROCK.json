  "OVERVIEW": "The Wingrock series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from tuff-breccia and sandstone and are on fan terraces below volcanic necks.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

They formed in fan alluvium derived dominantly from tuff-breccia and similar volcanic rocks with additions of local sandstone.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 6,000 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 5 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high intensity thunderstorms between July and October.  The mean annual temperature is 51 to 54 degrees F.  The average frost-free period is 140 to 160 days."

Farb soils are shallow to sandstone on adjacent cuestas.  Fordbutte and Persayo soils are moderately deep and shallow, respectively, to siltstone bedrock on surrounding areas.  Huerfano soils are shallow to shale and sodium affected.  Kimbeto soils are fine-loamy and have natric and calcic horizons.  Tocito soils are fine-silty and undeveloped on low stream terraces.  Tsebitai soils are coarse-silty and occur on fan terraces below outcrops of siltstone."
