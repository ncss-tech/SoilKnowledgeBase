  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to a lithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.   The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 51 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between a depth of 8 and 24 inches (or lithic contact) for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 18 inches thick.  The particle-size control section averages 8 to 15 percent clay and 40 to 70 percent angular rock fragments.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry, 2 or 3 moist.  It is stony loam and may be gravelly or very gravelly loam or sandy loam in the lower part.  It is 15 to 55 percent angular gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles, and 0.1 to 3 percent surface stones.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry, 2 to 4 moist.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam and is very gravelly or very cobbly.  It is 20 to 60 percent angular gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 dry of moist.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, coarse sandy loam, or loamy coarse sand.  It is very gravelly, very cobbly, extremely gravelly, or extremely cobbly.  This horizon is 35 to 60 percent angular gravel, 5 to 20 percent cobbles, and 0 to 5 percent stones."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wynhoff soils are on shoulders, backslopes, and footslopes of hills and mountains.  Elevations range from 1,400 to 4,700 feet.  Slopes are 8 to 65 percent.  These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from granite, rhyodacite porphyry and some metasedimentary rock with an admixture of loess.  The climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 18 inches.  The mean January temperature is about 25 degrees F, the mean July temperature is about 71 degrees F, and the mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 110 to 150 days."

Cashmont, Ginnis, Roosevelt, and Spokane soils are coarse-loamy. Couleedam, Johntom, Soaplake, and Swakane soils are shallow to a lithic contact.  Tyee soils are shallow to a paralithic contact.  Conconully soils are moderately deep to dense till.  Scoap soils are frigid."
