  "OVERVIEW": "The Wingate series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on till plains. They formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying calcareous loamy till. They are moderately permeable in the solum and moderately slowly permeable in the substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 965 mm (38 inches).",
