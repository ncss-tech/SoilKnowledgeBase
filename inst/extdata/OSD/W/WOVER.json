  "OVERVIEW": "The Wover series consists of very deep, poorly and very poorly drained soils that formed in residuum from travertine. Wover soils are on travertine terraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 450 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 3.3 degrees C.",
