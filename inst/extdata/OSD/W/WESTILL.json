  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 40 to 60 inches to Permian age redbed materials.  Secondary carbonates are within 24 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 20 inches in thickness and extends into the upper part of the Bt horizon in most pedons.  Weighted average clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  Most pedons have a few small slickensides at 10 to 15 degree angles from horizontal or small wedge shaped peds.  A minimal calcic horizon, present in some pedons, is at a depth of more than 40 inches.  Siliceous pebbles range from none to about 10 percent in the upper part of the pedon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is silt loam, silty clay loam or clay loam.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btkss horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 or 6.  Texture is clay, silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam.  Calcium carbonates occur in the form of concretions, films, threads, or masses.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 5 to 15 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has similar color, texture, and reaction as the lower Bt horizon, and contains paragravel fragments of claystone or siltstone.\nThe 2C, or 2Cd horizon where present, is clay loam, silty clay, clay, or interbedded layers of weakly cemented claystone or siltstone in shades of red, brown, gray, or green.  Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Culp and Lofton series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Tillman, Tilvern, and Vernon series.  Culp soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for longer periods and formed in sediments associated with Cretaceous age materials of the Blackland Prairie.  Lofton soils are dry in the soil moisture control section for longer periods and formed in clayey sediments of Pleistocene age on the Southern High Plains.  Also, Lofton soils are on nearly level benches above playa lakes or in slight depressions on uplands.  Tillman soils have Permian age redbed materials at a depth of more than 60 inches.  Tilvern and Vernon soils have an ochric epipedon.  In addition Vernon soils have Permian age redbed sediments at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Westill soils are on nearly level to gently sloping terraces or terrace remnants.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  The soil formed in a mantle of alluvium deposited over redbed clays and claystone of Permian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 26 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 64 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 200 to 230 days and elevation ranges from 1,400 to 2,100 feet.  The Thornthwaite annual P-E indices ranges from 32 to 40."

Frankirk soils formed from loamy alluvial sediments, do not have vertic properties, have secondary carbonates that occur deeper than 30 inches, and are on about the same landscape position.  Hollister soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick and occur on broad, nearly level areas slightly lower in the landscape.  Kingco soils occur on slightly concave slopes and are Vertisols.  Aspermont, Knoco, Tilvern, and Vernon soils have a ochric epipedon.  Aspermont, Knoco, and Vernon soils are lower in the landscape on steeper slopes.  Tilvern soils are on the same to slightly higher landscape positions."
