    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Willho soils are on alluvial terraces, basins, and basalt plains, plateaus and mesas at elevations of 4,800 to 5,800 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent.  These soils formed in loess and alluvium derived dominantly from quartz diorite and granodiorite, with minor amounts from basalt.  The average annual precipitation is 12 to 17 inches, most of which falls as snow.  The average annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 60 to 90 days."

Simonton soils lack a duripan and have a mollic epipedon.  Elkcreek and Harahill soils are on slightly higher more sloping positions on basalt plains.  Simonton soils are on landscape positions similar to Willho soils."
