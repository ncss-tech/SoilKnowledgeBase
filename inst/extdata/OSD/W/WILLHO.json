  "OVERVIEW": "The Willho series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils on basalt plateaus and mesas, alluvial terraces, basins, and basalt plains.  They formed in alluvium derived dominantly from quartz diorite and granodiorite and loess.  Permeability is very slow.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
