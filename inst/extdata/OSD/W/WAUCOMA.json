  "REVDATE": "11/2014",
  "STATES": "IA,MN",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Waucoma series consists of deep or very deep, well drained soils that formed in 100 to more than 150 centimeters of glacial drift with or without a thin layer of residuum or a reddish paleosol overlying limestone bedrock.  These soils are on summits and back slopes on uplands.  Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation is about 850 millimeters.",
