  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Whiterock soils are on backslopes of hills at elevations of 50 to 760 meters. Slopes are 3 to 60 percent. The soils formed in residuum weathered from slate, schist, and partially metamorphosed sandstone. These metasedimentary rocks of the Mariposa Formation are nearly vertically tilted and slab like rock outcrops are common. The climate is subhumid with hot dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 400 to 760 mm. Mean annual air temperature is about 16 to 17 degrees C; average January air temperature is about 7 to 8 degrees C and average July air temperature is about 25 to 26 degrees C. The frost-free period is 260 to 350 days."

Daulton and Exchequer occupy similar landform positions, but Daulton soils form in dark colored slates and Exchequer soils form in metavolcanic rock. Amador soils form on hills from rhyolite or acidic tuff, and are less than 50 cm to a paralithic contact. Argonaut soils form on concave positions on hills from metavolcanic rock, have an argillic horizon, and a paralithic contact from 50 to 100 cm. Auburn soils form on hills from metavolcanic rock and have a cambic horizon. Copperopolis soils form on the summit of hills, have greater than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle size control section, and have a cambic horizon. Hornitos soils form on hills from sandstone and have a cambic horizon."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 20 cm (A1 and A2 horizon)\nLithic contact: 20 to 30 cm (R horizon) vertically tilted fractures are 1-4 cm apart. Fragments of rock do not slake in water.\nParticle size control section for this pedon: 0 to 20 cm\nThis new typical pedon is within a mile of the original type location. The Whiterock soils were formerly classified as loamy, mixed, acid, thermic Lithic Xerorthents. Data from published soil survey reports and from the new type location do not support the former classification.\nType location should be examined to determine presence of C horizon over the R and consequently, depth class. The 1-4 cm fractures with roots in the bedrock horizon suggest that this horizon is not a lithic contact.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNASIS User Pedon ID: 82CA067003\nPedon Purpose: laboratory sample site\nLab Pedon #: 83P0293\nLab Source ID: SSL\nSoil classified using the 12th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
