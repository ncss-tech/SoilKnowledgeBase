  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Wrentham soils are usually moist, but are continuously dry for 70 to 90 days each year between depths of 4 and 12 inches during the 3-month period following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soil is 20 to 40 inches deep to basalt.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 20 to 36 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.  The percentage of rock-exposed surface ranges from 2 to 15 percent.  It has weak platy or subangular blocky structure.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  The moist value and chroma of 4 occur below depth of 20 inches.  The Bw horizon is silt loam, or silty clay loam and contains 20 to 60 percent cobbles and 5 to 50 percent gravel.  Its structure is weak or moderate subangular blocky."

They formed in loess mixed with some basalt colluvium.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  Mean winter temperature is 33 to 35 degrees F., mean summer temperature is 62 to 64 degrees F., mean annual temperature is 45 to 52 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 16 inches.  The frost-free period is 60 to 150 days."
