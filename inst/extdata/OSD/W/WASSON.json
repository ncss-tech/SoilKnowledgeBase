  "OVERVIEW": "The Wasson series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in stratified recent alluvium derived from sandstone and siltstone. Wasson soils occur in shallow swales and depressions on flood plains. Slopes are 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 80 inches, and the mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil is usually moist and is saturated with water during several months each year when not artificially drained. It is dry for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days between depths of 4 to 12 inches in the four month period following the summer solstice in most years. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. There is 0 to 5 percent gravel throughout the profile. The umbric epipedon is 10 to 14 inches thick. The particle-size control section has 5 to 10 percent clay and more than 15 percent fine sand or coarser. The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F. In some pedons, there are thin strata of finer textures below a depth of 35 inches. Depth to redoximorphic concentrations ranges from near the surface to 10 inches, and occur throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. It has masses of iron accumulation with having hue of 7.5YR or 5YR and chroma of 4 or more. It is loam with 7 to 15 percent clay.\nThe AC horizon, when present, has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Redoximorphic concentrations and matrix colors are similar to the A horizon. It is very fine sandy loam with 5 to 10 percent clay. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value of 3 to 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry and chroma of 1 moist, 1 or 2 dry. The upper part contains iron accumulations having hue of 10YR to 5YR with chroma of 4 or more. It is a stratified very fine sandy loam to loamy fine sand with 5 to 10 percent clay. Reaction is very strongly to moderately acid with pH decreasing with depth."

Meda soils are fine-loamy and occur on alluvial fans or toe slopes of mountains adjacent to flood plains or stream terraces. Natal soils are fine and on terraces. Quosatana soils are fine-silty and also occur in low or concave positions on flood plains. Wintley soils are fine textured, well drained, and occur on higher stream terraces."
