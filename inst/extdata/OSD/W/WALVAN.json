  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 8 and 24 inches for 75 to 90 consecutive days during the summer months.  Depth to bedrock is 60 inches or more.  The 0 to 40 inches particle-size control section has an estimate moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, phosphate retention of 50 to 75 percent, 15 bar water retention of 8 to 12 percent for air dried samples. Depth to lime dominantly ranges from 10 to 40 inches but some pedons lack lime. The A horizons are slightly acid to neutral and the C horizons are neutral to moderately alkaline but mildly or moderately alkaline in some part.  The profile ranges from very fine sandy loam to loam or silt loam.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has weak platy, blocky, or granular structure and is soft or slightly hard.\nThe C horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is massive or single grained and some pedons have very hard and firm horizons below a depth of 40 inches.  Horizons of nearly white ash are in the lower part of the control section in some pedons and more common below a depth of 40 inches."

Chemawa soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and have 10 to 30 percent shot-like aggregates in the surface layers.  Glide soils have a phosphate retention of 50 to 75 percent, contain 15 to 35 percent gravel size pumice fragments and have 35 to 55 inches of precipitation.  Parkdale soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and have 5 to 30 percent 1 to 5mm size nodules in the surface layer.  Shasta soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to sand and gravel.  Trouter soils are dry for 60 to 75 consecutive days and are 20 to 40 inches to lithic contact."

The climate is semiarid with moist winters and dry summers.  The mean annual temperature is about 47 to 54 degrees F., the mean winter temperature is about 35 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is about 65 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 16 inches.  The frost-free season (32 degrees F.) is 130 to 180 days."

Oregon has transferred responsibility of the series to Washington.  Walvan has been correlated in Adams, Columbia, Walla Walla and Whitman County, Washington.  The series type location is being moved to the Whitman County type site.  The classification has been updated based on amendment 16 from medial, mesic Mollic Vitrandepts to ashy, mesic Humic Vitrixerands."
