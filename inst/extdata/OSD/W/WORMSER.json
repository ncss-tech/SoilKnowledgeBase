  "OVERVIEW": "The Wormser series consists of moderately deep, well drained, slowly permeable soils that formed in calcareous loamy residuum weathered from sandstone.  Wormser soils are ondissected high plains and have slopes of 0 to 8 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 12 inches thick and the solum ranges from 12 to 24 inches thick.  The noncalcareous part of the solum is 10 to 20 inches thick.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is 35 to 40 percent clay, and has 15 to 25 percent more clay than the Al horizon.  This horizon has weak or moderate fine or medium subangular blocky structure.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR.  It has lime disseminated throughout with many soft nodular segregations of lime.  Fractured lense-like strata of angular fragments of limy sandstone are common in this horizon.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline."

Blackpipe, Huggins, Loma, Richfield, and Savo soils lack bedrock above a depth of 40 inches.  Boneek, Collbran, Kube, Nunn, Rednun, Ryus, Sofia and Torreon soils lack a lithic contact above a depth of 40 inches.  Emigrant and Querc soils have a paraiithic rather than lithic contact.  Chapin soils have hue in the Bt horizon redder than 7.5YR.  Thunderbird soils have a component of pyroclastic materials and lack a Cca horizon."
