    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a lithic contact is 11 to 20 inches. Depth to a paralithic contact is 10 to 19 inches. Wide variation in depth can occur within short distances. A paralithic contact above the lithic contact is not present in all profiles. The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 65 degrees F. and is more than 47 degrees F. from February 15 to December 15. The soil from 8 inches depth to the lithic contact is moist throughout from November 15 to May 1 and dry throughout about 120 days from June 1 to October 1 of each year.\nThe A horizon has color of 10YR 5/2, 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 6/2, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4; 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 6/4, 7/2 or 7/4. Moist color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 4/4, 5/2, 5/4; 2.5Y 4/4 or 5/4. Organic matter content is less than 1 percent. Clay content is 5 to 18 percent. It is noneffervescent to strongly effervescent. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to 5 percent. Gravel content is 0 to 15 percent. Cobble content is 0 to 8 percent. Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has color of 10YR 5/3, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2, 7/3, 7/4; 2.5Y 6/2, 6/4, 7/2 or 7/4. Moist color is 10YR 4/4, 5/4; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/4, 5/2 or 5/4. Texture is gravelly sandy loam, sandy loam or loam. Clay content is 5 to 18 percent. It is strongly effervescent or violently effervescent. Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 5 percent. Gravel content is 3 to 25 percent. Cobble content is 5 to 10 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe underlying Cr horizon of sandstone or shale is usually soft, strongly weathered, and fractured for up to 6 inches becoming extremely hard with increasing depth. The fractures are up to 1.5 inches wide and filled with soil and root material. Within 20 inches of the surface the bedrock cannot be hand dug with a spade and does not slake in water."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wisflat soils are on mountain slopes and escarpments of foothills, hills and mountains. Slope is 8 to 75 percent. These soils are formed in material weathered from sandstone or shale, usually of the Panoche Formation. Elevation is 200 to 4,810 feet. The climate is subhumid with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters. Mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches. Mean January temperature is about 50 degrees F; mean July temperature is about 79 degrees F; mean annual temperature is 58 to 64 degrees F. Frost-free season is 170 to 280 days."

Arburua soils, on foothills, hills and mountains, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Ayar soils, on foothills, have a fine particle-size control section. Conosta soils, on foothills, have an argillic horizon and a fine particle-size control section. Oneil soils, on foothills, have a mollic epipedon, a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and a fine-silty particle-size control section. San Timoteo soils, on low foothills, have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
