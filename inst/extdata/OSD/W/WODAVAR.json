Ferrogold soils have rock fragments that are limestone or dolomite. Infantry soils have Bk horizons with 35 to 60 percent cobbles and have significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan desert. Neso soils receive significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan desert and are in a 12 to 15 inch precipitation zone. Orrubo soils have Cr horizons below the hardpan at depths between 17 and 30 inches. Paisano soils receive significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan desert and depth to hardpan is less than 14 inches. Philder soils have aridic soil moisture regimes that border on ustic and have 18 to 25 percent clay. Sutherland soils have an ustic aridic soil moisture regime. Tencee soils receive significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts. Wechech soils are less than 14 inches to the hardpan, and receive additional summer moisture."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wodavar soils are on alluvial flats and lake terraces. These soils formed in residuum from lacustrine deposits. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. Elevations are 2,600 to 3,000 feet. The climate is warm and arid with hot dry summers and cool winters, typical of the Mojave Desert. The mean annual precipitation is 3 to 7 inches; mean annual temperature is 58 to 64 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 200 to 220 days."
