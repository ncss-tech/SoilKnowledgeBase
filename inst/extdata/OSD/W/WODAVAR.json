  "OVERVIEW": "The Wodavar series consists of shallow to a hardpan, well drained soils that formed in residuum from lacustrine deposits. Wodavar soils are on lake terraces and alluvial flats. Slope ranges from 2 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 5 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F.",

Ferrogold soils have rock fragments that are limestone or dolomite. Infantry soils have Bk horizons with 35 to 60 percent cobbles and have significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan desert. Neso soils receive significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan desert and are in a 12 to 15 inch precipitation zone. Orrubo soils have Cr horizons below the hardpan at depths between 17 and 30 inches. Paisano soils receive significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan desert and depth to hardpan is less than 14 inches. Philder soils have aridic soil moisture regimes that border on ustic and have 18 to 25 percent clay. Sutherland soils have an ustic aridic soil moisture regime. Tencee soils receive significant summer moisture, typical of the Chihuahuan and Sonoran deserts. Wechech soils are less than 14 inches to the hardpan, and receive additional summer moisture."
