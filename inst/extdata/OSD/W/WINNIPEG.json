Hootentown soils formed in alluvium and do not have a lithologic discontinuty (2Bt horizon).  Peridge soils have more sand in the upper part of the argillic horizon. Ryker and Stinesville soils have layers of glacial drift in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Winnipeg soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping, structural benches, strath terraces, and foot slopes. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. They formed in about 12 to 36 inches of loess and in the underlying hillslope sediments, colluvium, or residuum.  In some pedons the hillslope sediments may be underlain by alluvium instead of residuum. Mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 38 to 45 inches."

Hartville soils are clayey, somewhat poorly drained, and are on stream terraces. Pomme soils have more rock fragments and are on similar positions. Waben soils have more rock fragments and are on alluvial fans."
