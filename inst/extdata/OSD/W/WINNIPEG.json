  "OVERVIEW": "The Winnipeg series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in loess and the underlying hillslope sediments, colluvium, or residuum. Some pedons have alluvium beneath the hillslope sediments. These soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping structural benches, strath terraces and foot slopes. Slopes range from 1 to 8 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches.",
