  "OVERVIEW": "The Walum series consists of very deep, moderately well drained, soils that formed in glaciofluvial sand and gravel containing appreciable amounts of shale.  Permeability is moderately rapid above the sand and gravel and rapid or very rapid in the sand and gravel.  These soils are on glacial outwash plains and have slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches.",

It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is sandy loam, but some is coarse sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral.  The Bw horizon has few to many faint or distinct redoximorphic features.  It has weak or moderate prismatic structure parting to angular or subangular blocky structure.  A few faint clay films and organic stains coat the faces of peds in some pedons.  The 2Bw horizon, where present, is loamy sand or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5 or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It commonly is loamy sand or sand, but some pedons contain strata of coarse sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sand or coarse sand containing 5 to 50 percent gravel.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Crossbedding and stratification are common in the 2Bw, 2Bk, and 2C horizons."

Brantford and Renshaw soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Divide and Tolna soils are in slightly lower positions in swales and depressions.  Divide soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches. Tolna soils are coarse-loamy.  Kensal, Osakis and Warsing soils are on the same positions in the landscape as Walum soils.  Kensal and Warsing soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."

A different pedon may need to be selected to represent the series.  01/2000."
