  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to sand and gravel typically is 14 to 20 inches, but ranges from 10 to 25 inches.  The 2Bw, 2Bk and 2C horizons within the 10- to 40-inch control section contain more than 20 percent shale in the 0.1 to 76 mm fraction.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4 and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It is neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It commonly is sandy loam, but some is coarse sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  It is neutral.  The Bw horizon has few to many faint or distinct redoximorphic features.  It has weak or moderate prismatic structure parting to angular or subangular blocky structure.  A few faint clay films and organic stains coat the faces of peds in some pedons.  The 2Bw horizon, where present, is loamy sand or gravelly sandy loam.\nThe 2Bk horizon has hue of 2.5 or 5Y, value of 6 or 7 and 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It commonly is loamy sand or sand, but some pedons contain strata of coarse sandy loam or sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7 and 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sand or coarse sand containing 5 to 50 percent gravel.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Crossbedding and stratification are common in the 2Bw, 2Bk, and 2C horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Walum soils are on level and nearly level outwash plains.  Slope gradients are 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in glaciofluvial sand and gravel containing appreciable amounts of shale.  The climate is cool, subhumid.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 43 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation from about 16 to 20 inches.  Most of the moisture falls during spring and summer."

Binford, Brantford and Renshaw soils are on slightly higher positions.  Binford soils do not have redoximorphic depletions with chroma of 2 or less within depths of 40 inches.  Brantford and Renshaw soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal.  Divide and Tolna soils are in slightly lower positions in swales and depressions.  Divide soils have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches. Tolna soils are coarse-loamy.  Kensal, Osakis and Warsing soils are on the same positions in the landscape as Walum soils.  Kensal and Warsing soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."

A different pedon may need to be selected to represent the series.  01/2000.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
