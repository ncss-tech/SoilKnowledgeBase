  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetherill series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian material derived from siltstone and sandstone.  Wetherill soils are on plateaus, mesas, cuestas, hills, and terraces.  Slopes range from 1 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 356 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C.",
