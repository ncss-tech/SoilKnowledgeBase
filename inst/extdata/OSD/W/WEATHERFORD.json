  "OVERVIEW": "The Weatherford series consists of deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in sandy and loamy residuum weathered from sandstone and siltstone of Cretaceous age. These very gently sloping to strongly sloping soils occur mainly on convex ridges on hills. Slope range is 1 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 910 mm (36 in) and the mean annual temperature is about 17 degrees C (63 degrees F).",
