  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Whidbey soils are on hillslopes of glacial drift plains. Slopes range from 0 to 45 percent. These soils are formed in glacial drift overlying dense glaciomarine deposits. Elevations are from 0 to about 100 meters. These soils occur in a mild marine climate with warm dry summers and mild wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is about 457 to 762 mm, most of which falls as rain in the late fall, winter and early spring. Mean annual temperature is about 9 degrees C. The frost-free period is about 200-240 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Hoypus, Keystone, and Sholander soils. Keystone soils are found on glacial outwash plains, kames, kettles, and moraines. Keystone soils do not have a densic contact or redoximorphic features above 150 cm. Sholander, and Hoypus soils are on similar landscape positions. Sholander soils are sandy and have redoximorphic features at 20 to 46 cm. Hoypus soils do not have a densic contact or redoximorphic features above 150 cm."
