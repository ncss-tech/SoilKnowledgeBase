  "OVERVIEW": "The Wadena series consists of well drained soils that formed in glacial outwash consisting of a 24 to 40 inch loamy mantle over sandy and sandy- skeletal sediments.  These soils are on glacial outwash plains, stream terraces,  and valley trains.  They have moderate permeability in the solum and very rapid permeability in the underlying material.  They have slopes of 0 to 18 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 48 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and loamy mantle is 24 to 40 inches.  Depth to free carbonates is 30 to 60 inches.  Content of gravel ranges from 0 to 15 percent in the loamy mantle and 0 to 50 percent in the 2C horizon.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 24 inches thick.  The loamy mantle has between 18 and 30 percent clay and 25 to 40 percent of fine sand and coarser particles.\nThe A horizon has color value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loam or clay loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loam or clay loam in the upper part and coarse sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or loam in the lower part.  It typically is slightly acid or neutral but is moderately acid in the upper part of some pedons.\nA thin BC horizon with a fine-earth fraction of loamy coarse sand, loamy sand, coarse sandy loam, or sandy loam is in some pedons.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is coarse sand or sand or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  It typically is stratified.  It has as much as 10 percent fragments of shale in some pedons.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline in the upper part and slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the lower part."

The Fairhaven soils have silty clay loam or silt loam sola.  Kanaranzi soils are underlain by sand and gravel at depths of less than 24 inches.  Vanpetten soils have sola over 60 inches thick.  Waukee soils are more acid and underlain by leached sands and gravels."

Slope gradients range from 0 to 18 percent.  They formed in glacial outwash sediments consisting of a 24 to 40 inch loamy mantle over sandy and sandy-skeletal sediments.  These sediments are Late Wisconsin age.  The climate is continental with warm summers and cold winters.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 55 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 25 to 36 inches.  Frost-free days range from 124 to 190.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 700 to 1600 feet."

Well drained Estherville soils have landscape similar to Wadena soils but have less clay in the sola.  Poorly drained Biscay and Mayer soils are on nearby lower lying terrain.  Very poorly drained Talcot soils are in depressions and swales.  Mayer and Talcot soils have calcareous sola."
