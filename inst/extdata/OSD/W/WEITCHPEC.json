  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Weitchpec soils are on steep and very steep mountain slopes. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 259 to 1804 meters (850 to 5500 feet). The soils formed in material weathered from serpentinized rocks. The climate is humid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 760 to 3050 millimeters (30 to 120 inches). Mean January temperature is 3 to 5 degrees C (38 to 41 degrees F.), and mean July temperature is 18 to 24 degrees C (65 to 75 degrees F.). Mean annual temperature is 10 to 13 degrees C (50 to 55 degrees F). Frost-free season is estimated to be about 90 to 230 days."

Gasquet and Walnett soils are in concave to linear positions and are on more stable positions on mountain slopes. Jayel and Oragran soils are on very strongly convex positions."

    "content": "REMARKS: The Weitchpec soils were formerly classified as Regosols. Since most pedons have many coarse fragments, the series is now defined as a member of the loamy-skeletal family.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to 5 centimeters (2 inches) (A horizon).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 5 to 30 centimeters (2 to 12 inches) (Bt horizon). Particle-size\ncontrol section - the zone from 25 to 56 centimeters (10 to 22 inches) (Bt and BCt horizon).\nLithic contact - the boundary at about 56 centimeters (22 inches) (R).\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nSource: 10th Edition of the Keys to Soil Taxonomy.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
