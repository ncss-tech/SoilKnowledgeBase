  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Weigang series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately permeable soils that formed in residuum that weathered from sandstone bedrock and claystone.  These soils are on gently sloping to steep uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 635 mm (25 in) and the mean annual air temperature is about 21.7 degrees C (71 degrees F).",
