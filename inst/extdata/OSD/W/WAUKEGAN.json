  "OVERVIEW": "The Waukegan series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in 50 to 100 centimeters of loess or silty glacial alluvium and in the underlying sandy or sandy-skeletal glacial outwash. These soils are on slightly concave to convex slopes on glacial outwash plains and valley trains. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 837 millimeters. Mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
