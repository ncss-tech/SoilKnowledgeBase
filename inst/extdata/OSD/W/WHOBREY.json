  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist but is dry in the moisture control section for a short period of less than 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Base saturation is presumed to exceed 60 percent between depths of 25 and 75 centimeters.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  Thickness of the solum and depth to the clay 2Bss horizon is 20 to 36 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist, 5 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Redox concentrations and depletions range from none to many, fine to medium, and faint to prominent.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is 20 to 30 percent clay.\nThe 2Bss horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma commonly of 1, but ranging from 0 through 2.  There are few to common slickensides.  This horizon is clay or silty clay and averages 0 to 15 percent gravel and commonly 60 percent or more clay, but ranges from 50 to 65 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whobrey soils are in concave to convex positions on mountain ridgetops, saddles and side slopes at elevations of 100 to 2,500 feet.  Slopes are unstable and range from about 7 to 60 percent.  Slumping is common.  The soils formed in silty colluvium and residuum weathered from highly fractured, intensely sheared and deeply weathered sedimentary rocks of Jurassic Age (mostly the Otter Point formation).  The climate is characterized by warm, wet winters and hot, moist summers.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 54 degrees F.  The mean annual precipitation is typically 60 to 100 inches.  In the interior mountains of Curry County, Oregon, the mean annual precipitation may range to 130 inches.  The frost-free period is 120 to 220 days."

All of these soils lack contrasting textures within the particle-size control section.  Bohannon and Preacher soils have an umbric epipedon.  Also, the Bahannon soils are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Digger soils are loamy-skeletal and are 20 to 40 inches deep to a paralithic contact.  Etelka soils are fine-textured.  Remote soils are loamy-skeletal."
