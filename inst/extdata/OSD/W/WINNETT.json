  "OVERVIEW": "The Winnett series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived dominantly from shale.  Winnett soils are on alluvial valley floors and drainage bottoms.  Slopes are 1 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The moisture control section is dry for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to July 15 when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  It is neither dry in all parts of the moisture control section for as long as 45 consecutive days following the summer solstice to October 20, nor for as long as 90 cumulative days during the period.\nClay percentage in the particle size control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  These soils are calcareous to the surface.  Secondary lime occurs as fine threads in the substrata.\nCoarse fragments range 0 to 15 percent throughout the pedon but are normally less than one percent.  Depth to the base of the Bt horizon ranges from 4 to 12 inches.\nThe E horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silty clay or silty clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay."
