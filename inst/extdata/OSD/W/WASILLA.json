The control section consists of strata of silt loam, fine sandy loam, and silty clay loam.  Clay content ranges from 18 to 35 percent with greater than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  Gravelly alluvium or glacial till may occur below 40 inches.  Reaction throughout the profile is very strongly or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value moist of 2 or 3; and chroma moist from 1 through 3.  Content of coarse fragments is less than 15 percent.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value moist from 4 through 7; and chroma moist from 0 through 2."
