Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid in the A horizon.  Very strongly acid to neutral in the B horizon and neutral to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.  Rock fragments of diabase or basalt gravel and cobbles range from 0 to 10 percent in the solum and 2 to 25 percent in the C horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 1 through 3 or is neutral.  Texture is silt loam or loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 8 and chroma of 1 through 4 or is neutral.  It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  Low chroma mottling is common throughout the B.  The Bt horizon is clay, clay loam, or silty clay.  BE or BC horizons include clay loam or sandy clay loam.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value or 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay loam, loam, sandy loam or loamy sand, from strongly weathered diabase or basalt."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  This soil has previously been mapped as Elbert and Iredell.  The Elbert is a Typic Epiaqualf.  The Iredell is thermic.\nDiagnostic characteristics and features of this pedon are:\n1.  Ochric epipedon-the zone from the surface to 9 inches (A and Eg horizons)\n2.  Albic horizon-the zone from 1 to 9 inches (E horizon)\n3.  Argillic horizon-the zone from 9 to 35 inches (BEg, Bt horizons)\nClassification was changed with this update of the series.  There was some question as to where to start the argillic horizon.  Lab data has increase between the 1-9 inch and 9-12 inch layers sufficient to start the argillic at 9 inches.  There is no visual evidence of clay translocation in the description, however none is needed .  Placement of the argillic at the 9 inch depth eliminates the Albaquic Hapludalf subgroup and places this pedon in an Aeric Epiaqualf subgroup.  Classification changed in 2013 because of a linear extensibility of 6.0 cm or more between the mineral soil surface and a depth of 100 cm.  Vertic keys out before Aeric.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lab analysis available from VPI&SU, Virginia sample number S80VA-153-034.\nSIR = VA-193\nMLRA = 148\nREVISED = 9/97, RRD; 2013 changed from Aeric Epiaqualfs to Vertic Epiaqualfs, DTA.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
