  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock are more than 60 inches. Depth to the 2Bt horizon ranges from 20 to 50 inches. Coarse fragments are mostly chert, but may include limestone and sandstone and are mostly gravel or cobble size. Percent coarse fragments range from 10 to 45 in individual horizons above the 2Bt, but the control section averages less than 35 percent. Percent coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 in the 2Bt horizon. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper part of the solum, and very strongly acid to strongly acid in the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon or an EB in some pedons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 8. It is loam, silt loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.\nThe 2Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 6 or 8. It is silty clay or clay, with 25 percent more clay than the overlying horizon and more than 43 percent clay"

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Watahala soils formed in residuum from chert or cherty limestones over residuum from more pure limestone and are on uplands in limestone valleys. Slope gradients range from 2 to 60 percent. Climate is humid continental. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 51 to 58 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 46 inches, and elevation ranges from 1,200 to 2,800 feet above sea level. Surface stones are common in places and stony to extremely stony phases are recognized."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Blackthorn, Bolton, Brushy, Caneyville, Carbo, Edom, Elliber, Frederick, Hagerstown, McClung, Mertz, and Murrill series. Blackthorn, Mertz, and Murrill formed in moderately deep to very deep colluvial sediments over limestone residuum. Bolton soils have a base saturation more than 35 percent in the lower parts of the solum and have a 20 percent or more clay decrease within 60 inches. Brushy soils have chert bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Caneyville and Carbo soils have limestone bedrock within a depth of 40 inches, a clayey subsoil horizon within a depth of 20 inches, and are less cherty. Elliber soils have less than 27 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil. Frederick and Hagerstown soils have a clayey subsoil layer within 20 inches of the surface; additionally, Hagerstown soils have a base saturation of more than 35 percent in the lower parts of the solum. McClung soils have less than 35 percent clay in the solum."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: The soils are used for the production of timber and related natural resources. Some areas are used for pasture or have been developed for homesites. Some less sloping areas are used for row crops. The overstory in most areas consists of white oak, red oak, eastern white pine, black locust, chestnut oak, yellow-poplar, red maple, black birch, white ash, and black cherry. The understory contains mountain laurel, huckleberry, azalea, flowering dogwood, sassafras, black locust, black gum, wild grape, red maple, multi-flora rose, Virginia creeper, black birch, black berry and ferns."

(A, E, and BE horizons).\nb) Argillic horizon: The zone from 23 to 63 inches. (Bt1 and 2Bt2 horizons).\nc) Abrupt textural change occurs at 36 inches (top of the 2Bt horizon).\nADDITIONAL DATA: Soils now within the range of the Watahala series were correlated as Frederick, gravelly phase in several published soil surveys.\nLaboratory analyses for physical and chemical characteristics were run on 9 pedons from Alleghany, Bath, Lee, and Russell Counties, Virginia. (S95VA-017-50, S95VA-005-001, S94VA-005-030, S94VA-105-006, S94VA-105-007, S94VA-105-008, S95VA-167-007, S95VA-167-008, S95VA-167-009)\nAdditional contributors to this series were JDS and RRD.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
