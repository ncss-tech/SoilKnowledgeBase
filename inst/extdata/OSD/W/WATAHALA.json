  "OVERVIEW": "The Watahala series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in residuum from chert or cherty limestone over residuum from purer limestone on low hills and ridges in limestone valleys. Permeability is moderately slow to moderately rapid. Slope ranges from 2 to 60 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 44 inches and mean annual air temperature is about 57 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to bedrock are more than 60 inches. Depth to the 2Bt horizon ranges from 20 to 50 inches. Coarse fragments are mostly chert, but may include limestone and sandstone and are mostly gravel or cobble size. Percent coarse fragments range from 10 to 45 in individual horizons above the 2Bt, but the control section averages less than 35 percent. Percent coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 in the 2Bt horizon. Reaction is extremely acid to strongly acid in the upper part of the solum, and very strongly acid to strongly acid in the 2Bt horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nSome pedons have an Ap horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe BE horizon or an EB in some pedons have hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 6. It is silt loam, loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 or 8.

Slope gradients range from 2 to 60 percent. Climate is humid continental. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 51 to 58 degrees F., mean annual precipitation ranges from 42 to 46 inches, and elevation ranges from 1,200 to 2,800 feet above sea level.

Blackthorn, Mertz, and Murrill formed in moderately deep to very deep colluvial sediments over limestone residuum. Bolton soils have a base saturation more than 35 percent in the lower parts of the solum and have a 20 percent or more clay decrease within 60 inches. Brushy soils have chert bedrock within a depth of 40 inches. Caneyville and Carbo soils have limestone bedrock within a depth of 40 inches, a clayey subsoil horizon within a depth of 20 inches, and are less cherty. Elliber soils have less than 27 percent clay and more than 35 percent rock fragments in the subsoil. Frederick and Hagerstown soils have a clayey subsoil layer within 20 inches of the surface; additionally, Hagerstown soils have a base saturation of more than 35 percent in the lower parts of the solum. McClung soils have less than 35 percent clay in the solum."
