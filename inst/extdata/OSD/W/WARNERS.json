  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to marl or to other friable material impregnated with carbonates ranges from 16 to 30 inches. Bedrock is at depths greater than 60 inches. Subhorizons in some pedons contain up to 20 percent rock fragments. Reaction ranges from slightly acid through slightly alkaline in the A horizon and is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline in the C horizons.\nSome pedons have O horizons less than 6 inches thick.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam, with or without mucky analogues. Structure is moderate or strong, fine to coarse granular. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe AC horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 1 or 2, with distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. Texture of the fine-earth fraction is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam. The horizon is massive, or structure is weak to strong, fine to coarse granular. Consistence is very friable through firm.\nThe C or 2C horizon has hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 8, and chroma of 1 or 2. Calcium carbonate equivalent is more than 40 percent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Warners soils are on nearly level floodplains below springs flowing from limestone bedrock, at the margin of lakes, and on hillsides where there is seepage of calcium carbonate charged water. The soils developed in mineral material of mixed mineralogy, alluvial in origin that overlies marl, either impregnated with calcium carbonate or having marl within the soil. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent on floodplains and lake plains, and up to 8 percent in upland seep areas. Climate is humid temperate. Mean annual temperature ranges from 46 to 55 degrees F; mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches; and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 140 to 210 days. Elevation ranges from 250 to 1000 feet above sea level."

The wettest areas contain hydrophytic vegetation which often consists of sedges and cattails. Woodlands commonly consist of elm, soft maple, willow, and shrubs tolerant of wet sites."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: In the typical profile the Cg horizon designation is changed to AC due to the structure and colors displayed. It is assumed that this horizon does not contain over 40 percent carbonates. This is necessary to place the pedon in Endoaquolls and not Calciaquolls and in the Fluvaquentic subgroup and not the Cumulic subgroup.\nA review of pedons mapped Warners in the past suggests that many may classify as Calciaquolls. Pedons of Warners in the southern part of its range have been reclassified into another series. Use in MD and PA and MLRA 147 is dropped.\n1). Original classification placed Warners in the great group Haplaquolls. Because of changes established in the 5th edition of `Keys to Soil Taxonomy' this soil now classifies in the great group of Endoaquolls. Competing series may change as similar soils are reclassified.\n2). The depth to marl and other friable material impregnated with carbonates has been made deeper than 16 inches to avoid overlap with Calciaquolls classification. Pedons formerly called Warners that have a calcic horizon should be classified in the Calciaquolls great group.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon are:\na). Mollic epipedon - from 0 to 8 inches (Ap horizon).\nb). Aquolls suborder - as evidenced by AC horizon being directly below the mollic epipedon (Ap horizon) with matrix chroma of 1, hue of 10YR, and contains redoximorphic features.\nc). Fluvaquentic subgroup - an irregular decrease in organic carbon content, and slope less than 25 percent.\nd). Carbonatic mineralogy class - more than 40% CaCO3 by weight in the 2C horizon.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
