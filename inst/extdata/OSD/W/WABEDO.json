  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to dense till (paralithic contact) ranges from 40 to 50 inches and the depth to free carbonates is 10 feet or more.  The solum and C horizon typically contain 2 to 25 percent rock fragments, by volume, of mixed lithology, but mostly of igneous origin.  The particle size control section commonly has 6 to 18 percent clay and 45 to 65 percent fine sand or coarser material.  The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days at some time in most years for the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4 and chroma of 1 or 2.  The Ap horizon where present has hue of 10YR, value of 5 or 6,  and chroma of 1 to 3 dry.  The A horizon is sandy loam and less commonly fine sandy loam or cobbly sandy loam.  It is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have a E horizon that has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is typically sandy loam, but includes loamy sand and loamy fine sand.  It has faint to prominent mottles.  It is strongly acid or moderately acid.  Some pedons have EB or BE horizons.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has distinct or prominent mottles.  It is sandy loam or fine sandy loam.  Loamy sand is included when it has more than 2 percent clay and 20 percent silt.  It is very strongly acid to slightly acid.  Bulk density ranges from 1.45 to 1.80 gm/cc.\nThe BC and Cd horizons have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6.  They have faint to prominent mottles with hues of 10YR to 5YR.  It is sandy loam or loamy sand.  Stone lines with up to 25 percent rock fragments are in some pedons.  The BC horizon is restrictive to root penetration due to the platy soil structure, which is a property of this dense till, but is not as restrictive as the Cd horizon.  They are strongly acid to neutral.  Bulk density of the BC ranges from 1.75 to 1.90 gm/cc and bulk density of Cd ranges from 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc.  The Cd is considered to be a paralithic contact.  It has bulk density of 1.8 to 2.0 gm/cc."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Buckland, Eelweir, and Kalurah series.  Buckland soils have a Cd horizon (paralithic contact) within 40 inches from the surface.  Eelweir and Kalurah soils do not have bulk densities above 1.8 gm/cc in the series control section.  In addition, Buckland, Eelweir, and Kalurah soils have soil moisture control sections which are dry for less than 20 consecutive days in most years during the 120 days following the summer solstice."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on plane to slightly convex positions on the crests and sideslopes of drumlins or on moraines. Slope gradients range from 1 to 6 percent and slope lengths commonly are 200 to 500 feet.  The soils formed in noncalcareous dense loamy glacial till.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 24 to 30 inches.  Frost-free days range from 90 to 145.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 800 to 1450 feet."

The Flak soils are well drained and are on steeper or higher lying terrain.  The poorly drained Nokay soils are on plane to slightly concave footslopes in ground moraines and drumlins.  The Watab soils are poorly drained and have 20 to 40 inch sand cap over dense till."
