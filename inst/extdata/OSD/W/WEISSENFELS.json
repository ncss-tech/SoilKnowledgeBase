  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to a calcic horizon is 20 to 30 inches. A  lithic contact is at a depth of 25 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is about 52 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days during summer and fall. The natric horizon averages 35 to 45 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and ESP of 15 to 30.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick and includes part of the natric horizon.  Some pedons have a thin E horizon just above the natric horizon.\nThe Btn1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry; 2 or 3 moist; and chroma of 2 or 3 dry.  It has prismatic, subangular blocky, or columnar structure.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Btn2 horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist. Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon is silt loam or gravelly silt loam.  Reaction is moderately  alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bkq horizon has value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 7 moist and chroma of 1 through 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly loam, very cobbly loam or  gravelly loam.  The coarse fragments include 20 to 50 percent lime-silica indurated fragments."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weissenfels soils are on basalt plateaus.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in loess and alluvium from weathered basalt.  Elevation ranges from 1,200 to 2,700 feet.  Summers are warm and dry and winters are  cool and moist.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 12 to 15 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 135 to 155 days.\nGEOGRAPHICALLY Associated soils  They are the Bolicker, Nims, Olical and  Spofford soils.  Bolicker, Olical and Spofford soils have lithic contact at a depth greater than 40 inches.  Nims soils lack a natric horizon."
