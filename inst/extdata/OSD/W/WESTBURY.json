    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the only series in this family.\nSimilar soils in related families are the Cabot, Camroden, Crary, Dannemora, Empeyville, and Peru series. Cabot and Dannemora soils have cambic horizons. Camroden soils have a fine-loamy particle-size control section. Crary, Empeyville, and Peru soils lack mottles in the upper part of the spodic horizon."

Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 1727 mm, mean annual air temperature ranges from 1 to 11 degrees C, and mean annual frost-free days ranges from 90 to 140 days.

The Fishcreek (T) and Swancott (T) and soils are Sandy and Sandy-skeletal respectively, and are found on associated outwash deposits on terraces. Highmarket (T) soils are well drained and lack a fragipan. Dannemora and Tughill soils are poorly and very poorly drained and occur in depressions. Empeyville and Worth soils are moderately well drained and well drained respectively and are on adjacent higher knolls and ridges."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Many areas that were previously cleared are now used only for unimproved pasture. Hay is the principal crop, but corn for silage is important locally, also oats are grown in some cropping systems. Hardhack and meadow sweet are prominent in idle areas and pastures. Wood lots contain sugar and red maple, American beech, yellow birch, and some white pine."

    "content": "REMARKS: It is doubtful that this series is used in 144A because it is frigid. This needs to be investigated in the MLRA 144A update.\nDiagnostic horizons and other features recognized in the typical pedon:\n- Albic horizon: the zone from 10 to 15 cm deep (E)\n- Spodic horizon - the zone from 15 to 42 cm (Bh, Bs1, Bs2)\n- Fragipan - the zone from 77 to 150 cm (Bx)\n- Aquic moisture regime - redoximorphic features within 50 cm of the mineral surface\nADDITIONAL DATA: Pedon #10NY049029\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
