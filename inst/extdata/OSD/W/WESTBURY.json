  "OVERVIEW": "The Westbury series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in till derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale. Saturated hydraulic conductivity in the mineral material is moderately high or high above the fragipan and low to moderately high in the fragipan and substratum. Slope ranges from 0 to 25 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1476 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
