  "OVERVIEW": "The Walnut Grove series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in calcareous, loamy till. These soils are on slightly concave to slightly convex slopes on ground moraines and till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C. The mean annual precipitation is about 735 millimeters.",

This structure is evident in pits and cutbanks and rarely observed by by smaller scale investigations. The change in moist bulk density of 1.45 to 1.65 g/cc was based on some lab data of similar soils and field investigations by soil scientists on this geomorphic landform.\nBased on current investigations, elevation ranges in MLRA 103 is about 270 to 480 meters above sea level. However, the elevation data in the 2006 issue of USDA Handbook 296, has not been changed to agree with this elevation data.\nCation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from similar soils in the surrounding area.\nTaxonomy version--Keys to Soil Taxonomy, tenth edition, 2006."
