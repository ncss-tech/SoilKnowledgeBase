  "OVERVIEW": "The Walbert series consists of shallow, somewhat excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from semiconsolidated coarse grained sandstone.  These soils are on ridges, interfluves and sideslopes of hills.  Slopes are 2 to 35 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
