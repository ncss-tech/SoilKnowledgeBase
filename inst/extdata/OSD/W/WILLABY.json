  "OVERVIEW": "The Willaby series consists of deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in piedmont glacial drift.  These soils are on benches and terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 140 inches.",
