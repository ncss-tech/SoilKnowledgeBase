  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 72 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 18 to 38 inches. Chert content of horizons above the Btx horizons range from 3 to 15 percent. The chert and gravel content in the Btx horizons range from 20 to 75 percent. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to strongly acid, except in areas where the soils have been limed. Clay content of the Bt horizon ranges from 20 to 35 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 6. Texture is loam, silt loam, or fine sandy loam.\nThe BE or BA horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. It is loam, silty loam, or fine sand loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 4 to 8. Mottles in shades of brown or olive are in some pedons. It is clay loam, silty clay loam, or loam.\nThe Btx or 2Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma 4 to 8 with few to many gray, brown, or red mottles. In some pedons the 2Btx horizon is mottled in shades of gray, yellow, brown, and red. It is very cherty loam, very cherty clay loam, or very cherty sandy clay loam.\nThe horizons below the 2Btx or Btx are mottled red, brown, and yellow clay or cherty clay."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Ora and Savannah series. Series in similar families are the Barger, Bourne, Cane, Sidon, and York series. Barger soils are on uplands and formed in residuum weathered from chert underlying a mantle of depositional material. Bourne soils have a lithologic discontinuity below the fragipan. Cane and Ora soils have yellowish red or red Bt horizons. Savannah soils have less than 10 percent coarse fragments in all horizons. Sidon soils formed in residuum weathered from interbedded sandstone, siltstone, and shale. York soils formed in residuum weathered from fine-grained rocks and have mixed mineralogy."

Slopes are concave and range from 0 to 6 percent. The soils formed in old alluvium. Average annual temperature is about 60 to 65 degrees F; average annual precipitation is about 50 to 55 inches."

Bodine, Dewey, and Fullerton soils occur on higher landscape positions. Also, Bodine soils have more than 20 percent fragments of chert throughout the solum and lack a fragipan. Dewey and Fullerton soils have a clayey Bt horizon with hue of 5YR or redder. Guthrie soils are poorly drained. Minvale, Mountview, and Whitwell soils lack fragipans."
