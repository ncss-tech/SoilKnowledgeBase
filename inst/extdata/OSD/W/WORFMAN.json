    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and the paralithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature is 41 to 46 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 59 to 64 degrees F.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent throughout with about half breaking down on pretreatment.  Exchangeable sodium is less than 15 percent, and the EC is less than 2 mmhos throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay and more than 35 percent fine or coarser sand.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon consists of soft, weakly consolidated sandy shale and sandstone.  The bedded material is calcareous throughout and stratified.  Few thin strata of lithic shale and sandstone occur as discontinuous bands.  The bedrock is estimated to extend to depths greater than 15 feet."

Slopes are 0 to 20 percent.  Elevation ranges from 5,900 to 7,800 feet.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 14 inches of which about half falls as rain or snow in April, May, and early June.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season is estimated to range from 60 to 110 days."
