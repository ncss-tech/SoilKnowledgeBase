  "OVERVIEW": "The Wutchumna series consists of moderately deep to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from meta-gabbro. Wutchumna soils are on side slopes of hills. Slopes range from 5 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 63 degrees F.",
