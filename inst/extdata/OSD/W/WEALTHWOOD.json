Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the sandy mantle and strongly acid or moderately acid below this mantle.  Redoximorphic features occur immediately below the A horizon.  Bulk density ranges from 1.30 to 1.60 in the sandy mantle to 1.40 to 1.70 in the underlying material.  There are free carboantes within 80 inches.\nWhere present, an Oa horizon with hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2 is comprised of well decomposed leaves, needles and mosses.  It is 1 to 3 inches thick.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy fine sand, loamy sand, fine sand or sand.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2.

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wealthwood soils are on nearly level, plane or slightly convex slopes on lake plains.  They formed in noncalcareous, sand-mantled, stratified glacial lake sediments typical of Glacial Lake Mille Lacs.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 43 degrees F.   Frost-free days range from 90 to 130.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 26 to 30 inches.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1450 feet."

Omega soils are somewhat excessively drained and occur on steeper slopes. Nemadji soils are somewhat poorly drained and occur on slightly higher landscape positions.  Newson soils are poorly drained and occur on similar landscape positions.  Leafriver soils are very poorly drained and occur in shallow depressions.  Aftad and Alban soils are moderately well drained and well drained respectively and occur on higher landscape positions."
