  "OVERVIEW": "The Wealthwood series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in sandy sediments and underlying loamy and sandy noncalcareous, glaciolacustrine sediments on lake plains.  These soils have rapid permeability in the overlying sandy strata and moderately rapid to moderate permeability in the underlying strata.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 27 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
