  "REVDATE": "12/2015",
  "STATES": "KS,MO,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodson series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in silty and clayey sediments. These soils are on interfluves, divides, and paleoterraces. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1092 mm (43 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 14 degrees C (57 degrees F).",

The soils formed in sediments that are high in silt and clay. The sediments are presumed to be old alluvium but may contain loess in the upper part and grade into residuum from shale in the lower part. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1067 mm (35 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 18 degrees C (57 to 65 degrees F). Elevation is 215 to 405 meters (705 to 1330 feet) above mean sea level. Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index ranges from 64 to 78."

The better drained Bates, Dennis, and Kenoma soils are usually on more sloping topography. Aliceville, Catoosa, Lula, and Wagstaff soils are better drained and are commonly on nearby areas with similar slopes underlain by limestone. Leanna soils have albic horizons and are on flood plains and low terraces."
