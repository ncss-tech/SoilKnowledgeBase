  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Woodson soils are on interfluves, divides, and paleoterraces on plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in sediments that are high in silt and clay. The sediments are presumed to be old alluvium but may contain loess in the upper part and grade into residuum from shale in the lower part. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 889 to 1067 mm (35 to 42 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 14 to 18 degrees C (57 to 65 degrees F). Elevation is 215 to 405 meters (705 to 1330 feet) above mean sea level. Thornthwaite Annual P-E Index ranges from 64 to 78."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are Aliceville, Bates, Dennis, Catoosa, Kenoma, Leanna, Lula, and Wagstaff soils. The better drained Bates, Dennis, and Kenoma soils are usually on more sloping topography. Aliceville, Catoosa, Lula, and Wagstaff soils are better drained and are commonly on nearby areas with similar slopes underlain by limestone. Leanna soils have albic horizons and are on flood plains and low terraces."

Depth to the top of a perched seasonal high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (6 to 24 inches) between November and June in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is high or very high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low. Permeability is very slow."
