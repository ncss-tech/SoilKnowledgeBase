Texture is gravelly fine sandy loam or gravelly very fine sandy loam.  Siliceous pebbles range from 15 to 35 percent by volume.  The combined thickness of the A horizons is less than 10 inches.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nSome pedons have a thin discontinuous E horizon with value and chroma 1 to 2 units higher than the A.\nThe 2Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8.  Mottles in shades of brown, gray or yellow range from none to few.  Texture is clay and ranges from 60 to 70 percent clay.

Soils in similar families are the Arol, Axtell, Burlewash, Crockett, Darst, Falba, Kurten, Jedd, Lufkin, Rosanky, and Travis series.  All of these soils have a fine texture family.  Arol, Burlewash, and Falba soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact.  Axtell, Crockett, Kurten, Lufkin, Rosanky, and Travis soils have sola greater than 40 inches and base saturation greater than 75 percent throughout the argillic horizon.
