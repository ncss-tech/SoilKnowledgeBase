    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nWedowee soils were formerly mapped as thin solum phases of the Appling series. The May 1990 revision changed the classification to Typic Kanhapludults in recognition of the low activity clay content of the argillic horizon. The December 2005 revision moved the type location from Randolph County, Alabama to a more representative site in Granville County, North Carolina.  The November 2025 revision changed the formatting.  No data was changed.\nRevised: RLV 11/24/97; DTA 12/30/2005; DTA 11/2025\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (A and E horizons)\nArgillic and kandic horizon--the zone from 18 to 58 centimeters (7 to 23 inches) (Bt horizon)"
