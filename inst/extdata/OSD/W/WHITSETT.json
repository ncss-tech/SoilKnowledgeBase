(A and Bt horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 10 to 62(4 to 24 in). (Bt and Btk horizons)\nParalithic contact: sandstone at 80 cm (31 in). (top of Cr horizon)\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle size analysis was performed at the local project office on 3 pedons from McMullen County. The assignment of the cation-exchange activity class is inferred from lab data from soils that formed in similar geologic materials.\nTaxonomic version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Eleventh Edition, 2010.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
