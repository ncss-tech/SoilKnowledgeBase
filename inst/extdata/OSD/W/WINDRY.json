  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature at the lithic contact ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 90 to 100 days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 30 percent clay in the fine earth fraction and 35 to 70 percent rock fragments by volume.  Depth to bedrock and solum thickness range from 14 to 20 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 12 to 20 inches thick and includes all or part of the argillic horizon. Organic matter is estimated to range from 1 to 2 percent.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe AB horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is very gravelly clay loam, very gravelly loam or very cobbly loam.  It is weak fine and medium or moderate fine and medium subangular blocky.\nThe Bt horizon has a value of 4 through 6 dry or moist, and  chroma is 2 or 3, dry or moist.  It is extremely gravelly clay loam, extremely cobbly clay loam, or very cobbly loam.  It is moderate fine and medium or weak fine or medium subangular blocky structure."

Argabak soils are 4 to 12 inches to a lithic contact and are dry more than half of the time.  Bellehelen, Brier, Duco and Reywat soils have aridic soil moisture regimes.  In addition, Bellehelen and Brier soils are moist for 10 to 20 days from July to October and have mollic epipedon 7 to 12 inches thick. Chinabutte soils are dry in the moisture control section for 75 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice and have mollic epipedons 7 to 11 inches thick.  Clovercreek soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 80 consecutive days during summer and fall and are dominated by pebbles.  Duco soils are usually dry and have soil temperature of 50 to 53 degrees F.  Gwin soils are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Horseflat soils are dry in the moisture control section for more than half of the time that the soil temperature is above 40 degrees F.  Orhood soils are above 41 degrees F.  from March 15 to December l and have 5 to 10 percent stones throughout.  Upatad soils have 5 to 15 percent silica concretions and lime coatings on rock fragments in the 2Btk horizon."
