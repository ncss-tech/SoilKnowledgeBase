  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from 51 to 91 centimeters (20 to 36 inches). The particle size control section has clay content of 20 to 32 percent. The mollic epipedon ranges from 41 to 89 centimeters (16 to 35 inches) in thickness and extends into the upper part of the Bw horizon. Typically there are strata in the horizon above the glacial till. Strata ranges in texture from loam to silty clay loam and are 10 mm to 50 mm in thickness.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 and 3 or 4 dry, and chroma of 1.5 or less. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. It is slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 4 or 5 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. Few or common, faint to prominent redoximorphic features are in the lower part of the Bk horizon in most pedons. Accumulations of carbonate range from few to many. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 and 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or silty clay loam. Common or many, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features are in the C horizon of most pedons. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\n2C horizons of clay loam or loam glacial till typically occur deeper than 152 centimeters (60 inches), but is as shallow as 102 centimeters (40 inches) in some pedons."

The Beotia and Overly soils are varved with thin layers of sand to clay at a depth of 102 to 152 centimeters (40 to 60 inches). Varves range from less than 1 mm to 10 mm in thickness. The Graceland soils do not have strata in the horizon above the glacial till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Waubay soils are nearly level to undulating and are on footslopes and in swales. Slopes are plane or concave with gradients of 0 to 6 percent. The Waubay soils are formed in silty glacial drift. Mean annual temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C (38 to 45) degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 485 to 735 millimeters (19 to 29) inches. Growing season is about 120 to 160 days; average growing season precipitation ranges from 330 to 457 millimeters (13 to 18 inches); and growing degree days are about 2500 to 3000."

The somewhat poorly drained Badger soils have a fine textured control section and are in the deeper swales. The very poorly drained Oldham, Parnell, and poorly drained Tonka soils have a fine textured control section and are depressions. The well drained Buse and Rusklyn soils are on convex crest of steeper hills. They do not have a cambic horizon. The somewhat poorly drained Cubden soils are on nearby areas surrounding depressions or deeper swales. They have a calcic horizon within depths of 41 centimeters (16 inches). The well drained Poinsett soils have mollic colors less than 41 centimeters (16 inches) thick and are on slopes above the Waubay soils."

Saturarted hydraulic conductivity, measured in cm per hour, is 1.52 to 5.10 (.6 to 2.0 inches). Saturation occurs at depths as high as 3 feet during spring months in years of normal rainfall."
