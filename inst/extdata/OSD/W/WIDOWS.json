The soils are usually moist but are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for 60 to 80 consecutive days during the four-month period following the summer solstice.  Depth to a lithic contact is 10 to 20 inches.  Serpentine or ultramafic rock fragments range from 35 to 70 percent by volume throughout.  The thickness of the mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 20 inches and includes the Bt horizon. Hue is dominantly 10YR, but includes 7.5YR.  Base saturation by sum is 80 to 95 percent throughout the solum.\nThe A horizon has chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry and value 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry. The north-facing slopes. The A horizon is loam or clay loam with 20 to 35 percent clay. It has 0 to 10 percent stones, 15 to 40 percent cobbles, and 15 to 40 percent gravel.  The surface texture on north slopes is more loamy than on south slopes.\nThe Bt horizon has chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry and value 2 or 3 moist and dry.  The argillic horizon has 40 to 60 percent clay, 0 to 10 percent stones, 15 to 40 percent cobbles, and 15 to 40 percent gravel."

The Anatone soils are on side slopes, ridgetops, and shoulders of hills, are adjacent but weathered from non serpentine or mixed rock types, and are loamy-skeletal.  The Lemonex soils are on adjacent, higher, forested footslopes and side slopes of mountains and hills, have less than 35 percent rock fragments throughout, and  have serpentine bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches."
