  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The thickness of the solum ranges from 40 to 70 inches. Depth to the fragipan ranges from 17 to 28 inches and depth to bedrock is 4 to 20 feet or more. Rock fragments of subrounded or angular sandstone, conglomerate or quartzite range from 0 to 40 percent in individual layers above the fragipan and from 10 to 60 percent in the fragipan and C horizon. Illite is the dominant clay mineral with significant amounts of vermiculite and some kaolimite. Reaction of the mineral solum ranges from extremely acid to strongly acid where unlimed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Some pedons have A horizons with hue of 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Texture of the fine-earth is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture of the fine-earth is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6. Low chroma redoximorphic features are between 12 and 26 inches. Texture of the fine-earth is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nThe Bx horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 through 6 and typically have both low and high chroma redoximorphic features and grayish prism faces. Texture of the fine-earth is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.\nSome pedons have firm, gravelly sandy loam C horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Bath, Braceville, Broadalbin, Ira, Lackawanna, Mardin, Rushford, Sodus, Swartswood and Wellsboro series are in the same family. Bath, Lackawanna, Mardin, and Wellsboro soils commonly have 55 percent or more silt plus very fine sand in particle size control section. Braceville soils have stratified sand and gravel in the series control section. Broadalbin soils have rock fragments dominanted by granite, gneiss, and dark shale. Ira and Sodus soils have fragipans which are moderately acid to neutral. Rushville soils have a rock fragment content of less than 10 percent in the fragipan and C horizon. Swartswood soils do not have redoximorphic features above the fragipan or within a depth of 26 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wurtsboro soils are nearly level to moderately steep soils of glaciated uplands. Slope ranges from 0 to 35 percent. The soils developed in till derived primarily from acid gray and brown quartzite, conglomerate, and sandstone. The climate is humid temperate; mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 46 inches, mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 52 degrees F., and the frost free season ranges from 130 to 150 days."

Chippewa and Morris soils have low chroma matrix within 20 inches of the surface and are on landscapes of lower drainage. Lordstown soils have bedrock within 40 inches. Mardin and Wellsboro soils have more than 55 percent silt plus very fine sand in the particle-size control section and are on similar landscapes. Swartswood soils do not have redoximorphic features above the fragipan or within a depth of 26 inches and are on landscapes of better drainage. Volusia soils have between 18 and 34 percent clay in the fine-earth fraction and are on landscapes of lower drainage."
