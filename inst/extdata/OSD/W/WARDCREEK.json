  "OVERVIEW": "The Wardcreek series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium over residuum weathered from volcanic rock.  The Wardcreek soils are on the upper third of mountains. Slopes range from 30 to 70 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1000 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
