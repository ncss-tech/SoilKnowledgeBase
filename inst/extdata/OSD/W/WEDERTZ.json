  "OVERVIEW": "The Wedertz series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Wedertz soils are on terraces and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 0 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 125 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 10 degrees C.",

Alley soils lack an A2 horizon and are gravelly throughout the profile.  Allor and Qwynn soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Chime and Igert soils have bedrock within 100 cm. Cleghorn and Glyphs soils have a continuous brittle horizon. Mimentor soils have durinodes within 64 cm. Nevador soils lack an A2 horizon and has a moderate to strong prismatic or blocky Bt horizon and durinodes in a friable matrix. Wedlar soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms. Zevadez ???? soils have slightly acid or neutral Bt horizons."
