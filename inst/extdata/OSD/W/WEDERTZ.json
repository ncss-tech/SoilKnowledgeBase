Alley soils lack an A2 horizon and are gravelly throughout the profile.  Allor and Qwynn soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Chime and Igert soils have bedrock within 100 cm. Cleghorn and Glyphs soils have a continuous brittle horizon. Mimentor soils have durinodes within 64 cm. Nevador soils lack an A2 horizon and has a moderate to strong prismatic or blocky Bt horizon and durinodes in a friable matrix. Wedlar soils are moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and October due to convection storms. Zevadez ???? soils have slightly acid or neutral Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wedertz soils are on lake terraces and have slopes of 0 to 30 percent.  They have formed in materials derived primarily from granite with some admixture of limestone, andesite and volcanic ash superimposed over lacustrine sediments.  These soils are at elevations of 1,160 to 1,676 meters in a cool, semiarid climate having mean annual temperature of 10 to 12 degrees C, and a mean summer temperature of 17 to 18 degrees C.; mean annual precipitation is 200 to 360 mm.  Frost-free season is about 100 to 120 days."
