  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Woodbeck soils are on ground moraines and recessional moraines and the margins of outwash plains and lake plains of Wisconsinan age. Slope ranges from 2 to 18 percent. Woodbeck soils formed in a thin layer of clayey till or glaciofluvial deposits overlying outwash or lake deposited sands. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 711 to 914 mm (28 to 36 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.8 to 10.0 degrees C (46 to 50 degrees F)."

    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Well drained. Potential for surface runoff is medium or high depending upon slope. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the clayey part and high or very high in the sandy part. Permeability is moderately slow in the clayey part of the profile and rapid in the underlying sand."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION: Most areas of Woodbeck soils are cultivated. The principal crops grown are corn, hay, and small grain. A few areas are in apple orchards. Steeper areas are in permanent pasture, woodland or remain idle. Native vegetation is sugar maple, beech, and eastern white pine."
