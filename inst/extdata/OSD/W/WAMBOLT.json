Devaul soils are deep to paralithic contacts and are not intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative between July and September due to convection storms. Heechee and Holmes soils have 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Horrocks soils are deep to lithic contacts. Hoskin and Valmar soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts. Howcan soils have 40 to 60 percent rock fragments, mainly cobbles, in the particle-size control section. Glidski and Longday soils average less than 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Pequop soils are not moist in the upper part of the moisture control section for 10 to 20 days cummulative from precipitation received between July and September."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wambolt soils are on north aspects of mountains and upper fan remnants. These soils formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from quartzite. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. Elevations range from 1,985 to 2,595 meters. The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 360 to 410 mm, mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
