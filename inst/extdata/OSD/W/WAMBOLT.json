  "OVERVIEW": "The Wambolt series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and alluvium derived from quartzite. Wambolt soils are on mountains and upper fan remnants. Slopes are 8 to 30 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 380 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
