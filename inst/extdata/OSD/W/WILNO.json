  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilno series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in loamy local colluvium and glacial till on backslopes and footslopes on moraines. Slope ranges from 6 to 45 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Loamy colluvial sediments are typically 40 to over 80 inches thick, however loamy glacial till can occur at depths of 40 inches. Free carbonates are at depths of 40 to over 80 inches. Sand content in the 10 to 40 inch particle size control section is typically between 30 and 45 percent, but ranges from 25 to 50 percent. Clay content ranges from 18 to 30 percent. The mollic epipedon is 24 to 60 inches thick and does not contain fine strata or an irregular decrease in organic carbon. Below depths of 60 inches, the organic carbon content is less than .3 percent. Rock fragments of mixed lithology, by volune, range from 0 to 5 percent in the colluvial sediments and 2 to 8 percent in the underlying till.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Some pedons have surface horizons with recent erosional sediments. The A horizon is loam or clay loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe AB horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or clay loam.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4. It is loam, clay loam or less commonly sandy loam. Reaction is slightly acid or neutral.\nSome pedons have a Bt horizon with few to common clay films. However the B/A clay ratio is less then 1.2 required for an argillic.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, clay loam or less commonly sandy loam. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wilno soils are on slightly concave foot slopes and backslopes. Slope gradients are between 6 and 45 percent. The soils formed in loamy local colluvium derived from glacial till and glacial till of mixed mineralogy. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F., and\nmean annual precipitation is 19 to 27 inches. Annual frost free days are 120 to 170 days. Elevation ranges from 890 to 1950 feet above mean sea level."

The Barnes, Langhei and Buse soils are upland soils formed in glacial till, and they are on slopes above the Wilno soils.  In some places they are associated with the poorly drained Lakepark soils."
