  "OVERVIEW": "The Wags series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from nonacid shale.  Wags soils are on ridges and hills.  Slopes are 3 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.   The particle-size control section averages 40 to 60 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine and coarser sand.  The soil is dry in the moisture control section more than half the time cumulative that the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F., and is dry in all parts of the control section for at least 60 consecutive days from July 15 to October 25, and for at least 90 cumulative days during this period.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F., and the soil temperature at a depth of 20 inches is 41 degrees F. or more for 175 to 192 days.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is silty clay, clay, clay loam or silty clay loam.  It has up to 35 percent shale channers in the matrix.  A channery lag of 5 to 50 percent hard shale fragments occurs in most pedons.  It is neutral or slighty alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Textures are clay or silty clay.  It has 0 to 60 percent soft shale channers which break down on pretreatment with sodium hexametaphosphate, and 0 to 15 percent hard shale channers.  Up to four percent authigenic gypsum occurs in some pedons.  It is slightly acid through slightly alkaline.\nThe Cr horizon consists of dark brown to light gray nonacid shale, or interbedded shale and very fine grained sandstone."
