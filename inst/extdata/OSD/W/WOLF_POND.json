It consists of slightly through highly decomposed plant material. Reaction is extremely acid or very strongly acid.\nSome pedons have A horizons up to 8 centimeters thick with hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction of the A horizon ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 7, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand. Reaction ranges from extremely acid through strongly acid.\nSome pedons have a very friable or friable Bh horizon with hue of 2.5YR through 10YR, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Currently, the Onchiota (T) and Paquin series is the only competing series. Onchiota (T) and Paquin soils are saturated for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.\nIn closely related families is the Wallace, Voelker, and Borgstrom series. The Wallace, Voelker, and Borgstrom soils have a lower mean annual precipitation. Borgstrom soils are saturated for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years."

Mean annual precipitation is 890 to 1270 millimeters. Mean annual temperature ranges from 3 degrees to 7 degrees C. Mean annual frost-free days ranges from 70 to 160 days.

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Onchiota (T), Kushaqua (T), Adams, Colton, Searsport, Burnt Vly, and Monadnock soils. The moderately drained Onchiota (T), somewhat poorly drained Kushaqua (T), and very poorly drained Searsport soils are in lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with the Wolf Pond soils. Adams and Colton soils do not contain more than 50 percent ortstein and are on similar landscape positions. The organic Burnt Vly soils are in adjacent depressions and drainageways. The Monadnock soils are formed in till and have less than 60 percent ortstein in any layer."
