  "OVERVIEW": "The Wolf Pond series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sandy deposits on lake plains, outwash plains, and mountain valley sides. Saturated hydraulic conductivity ranges from moderately low to moderately high in the ortstein layer, and high to very high throughout the remainder of the pedon. Slopes range from 0 to 35 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1016 millimeters and mean annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",

The moderately drained Onchiota (T), somewhat poorly drained Kushaqua (T), and very poorly drained Searsport soils are in lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with the Wolf Pond soils. Adams and Colton soils do not contain more than 50 percent ortstein and are on similar landscape positions. The organic Burnt Vly soils are in adjacent depressions and drainageways. The Monadnock soils are formed in till and have less than 60 percent ortstein in any layer."
