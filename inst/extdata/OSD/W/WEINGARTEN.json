  "OVERVIEW": "The Weingarten series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in loess and other silty sediment overlying residuum weathered from cherty limestone or dolomite.  These soils are on uplands and have slopes ranging from 2 to 45 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 44 inches.",

It is clay, silty clay, and, less commonly, silty clay loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.

Baraboo, Dubuque, Knowles, La Farge, and Marseilles soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Blackhammer soils have a soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F., and have the lower part of the solum formed in stratified loamy pedisediment.  Cadiz, Dodge, Lomira, Pottersville, Russell, and Stubenville soils have a calcareous horizon within 40 inches of the surface. Hackers, Mentor, Polermo, Uniontown, and Westmore soils lack a 2Btb horizon. Jackson and Yellowriver soils have a soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F.  Palsgrove and Westbend soils have a lithic or paralithic at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Wrengart soils are oxyaquic."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were origionally classified as Typic Hapludalfs. The addition of the fragic subgroup to the Hapludalf order changed the classification.  These soils have been included in the mapping of or considered a taxadjunct to the Menfro or Winfield series.  They occupy landscapes between the deep loess (Menfro soils) near the Mississippi River and the thin loess (Hildebrecht and Union) soils with fragipans.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 11 to a depth of over 72 inches (Bt horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
