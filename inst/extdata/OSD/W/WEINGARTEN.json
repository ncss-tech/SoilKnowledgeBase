The mean annual soil temperature is 55 to 59 degrees F.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  Dry value is 6 or more.  Reaction is neutral to moderately acid.\nSome pedons have an E horizon with hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 to 6.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.   Some pedons have up to 10 percent chert gravel in the lower part of the Bt horizon and the Btx horizon. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Btx horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid. Brittleness is evident in 30 to 60 percent of the mass.\nThe 2Btb horizon has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 4 to 8.  It is clay, silty clay, and, less commonly, silty clay loam or their gravelly or very gravelly analogues.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly alkaline.  Some pedons have a thin stone line at the top of the 2Btb horizon."

Series in similar families are the Baraboo, Blackhammer, Cadiz, Dodge, Dubuque, Hackers, Jackson, Knowles, La Farge, Lomira, Marseilles, Mentor, Palermo, Palsgrove, Pottersville, Russell, Sandview, Stubenville, Uniontown, Westbend, Westmore, Wrengart, and Yellowriver series. Baraboo, Dubuque, Knowles, La Farge, and Marseilles soils have a lithic or paralithic contact at depths of 20 to 40 inches. Blackhammer soils have a soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F., and have the lower part of the solum formed in stratified loamy pedisediment.  Cadiz, Dodge, Lomira, Pottersville, Russell, and Stubenville soils have a calcareous horizon within 40 inches of the surface. Hackers, Mentor, Polermo, Uniontown, and Westmore soils lack a 2Btb horizon. Jackson and Yellowriver soils have a soil temperature of less than 54 degrees F.  Palsgrove and Westbend soils have a lithic or paralithic at a depth of 40 to 60 inches.  Wrengart soils are oxyaquic."

The soils formed in 40 to 60 inches of loess and other silty sediment over residuum weathered from cherty limestone or dolomite.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 57 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 45 inches."

Bucklick, Caneyville, and Gasconade soils have bedrock at depths less than 60 inches and are on lower side slopes.  Goss soils have cherty clayey subsoils and are on lower side slopes.  Hildebrecht soils have a fragipan and are in similar positions. Wrengart soils are oxyaquic and are on similar postions."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: These soils were origionally classified as Typic Hapludalfs. The addition of the fragic subgroup to the Hapludalf order changed the classification.  These soils have been included in the mapping of or considered a taxadjunct to the Menfro or Winfield series.  They occupy landscapes between the deep loess (Menfro soils) near the Mississippi River and the thin loess (Hildebrecht and Union) soils with fragipans.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 11 to a depth of over 72 inches (Bt horizons)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
