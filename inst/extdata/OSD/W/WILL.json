  "OVERVIEW": "The Will series consists of poorly drained soils that are moderately deep to sand and gravel on nearly level or depressional parts of outwash plains, stream terraces, lake plains, valley trains, and moraines. These soils formed in loamy outwash overlying calcareous gravel and sand at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Some pedons have a thin mantle of silty material up to 51 cm (20 inches) thick. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 864 mm (34 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 8.9 degrees C (48 degrees F).",

The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Water will pond on these soils for brief periods during the spring. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper and middle parts of the series control section and very high (greater than 141.11 micrometers/s) in the lower part.
