    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Biscay, Marshan, Mudhen, and Niwot series. Biscay soils are not clearly differentiated but are typically drier in the moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice. Marshan soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to carbonates. Mudhen soils have a paralithic contact within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches). Niwot soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size class within a depth of 51 cm (20 inches) and receive less than 46 cm (18 inches) of precipitation annually."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Will soils are on nearly level or depressional parts of outwash plains, stream terraces, lake plains, valley trains, and moraines. Slope gradients commonly are less than 2 percent and range from 0 to 3 percent. These soils formed in loamy outwash overlying stratified calcareous gravelly and sandy deposits at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches). Some pedons have a silty mantle that ranges from 0 to 51 cm (0 to 20 inches) in thickness. Mean annual temperature ranges from 7.2 to 12.2 degrees C (45 to 54 degrees F), mean annual precipitation ranges from 740 to 1020 mm (29 to 40 inches), frost-free period ranges from 140 to 190 days, and elevation ranges from 207 to 311 meters (680 to 1020 feet) above sea level."

The well drained Warsaw soils and the somewhat poorly drained Kane soils form a hydrosequence with Will soils. The well drained Dresden and somewhat poorly drained Matherton soils do not have mollic epipedons. The well drained Lorenzo soils are shallower to sand and gravel. The well drained Wea soils are deeper to sand and gravel."

An intermittent apparent high water table is 15 cm (0.5 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface at some time during the spring in most years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Water will pond on these soils for brief periods during the spring. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers/s) in the upper and middle parts of the series control section and very high (greater than 141.11 micrometers/s) in the lower part. Permeability is moderate in the upper and middle parts of the series control section and very rapid in the lower part."
