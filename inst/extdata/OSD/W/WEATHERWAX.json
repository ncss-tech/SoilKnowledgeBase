Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 25 to 50 percent for air dried samples and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 2 to 3 percent.  Organic matter is 15 to 40 percent.  It has 2 to 12 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam."
