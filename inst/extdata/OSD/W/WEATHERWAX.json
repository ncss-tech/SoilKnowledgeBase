  "OVERVIEW": "The Weatherwax series consists of very shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and sedimentary rocks on mountains slopes.  Slopes are 30 to 100 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 190 inches and average annual temperature is about 38 degrees F.",

Mean winter soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist and have a surplus of available water on a monthly basis throughout the year; perudic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 4 to 10 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with an estimated moist bulk density of 0.30 to 0.70 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 3 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 25 to 50 percent for air dried samples and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  Acid oxalate extractable iron is 2 to 3 percent.  Organic matter is 15 to 40 percent.  It has 2 to 12 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist and 4 or 6 dry.  It is extremely gravelly medial sandy loam, extremely cobbly medial sandy loam, or extremely cobbly medial loam."
