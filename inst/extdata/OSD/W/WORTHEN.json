  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are: Mollic epipedon (cumulic) - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of approximately 74 cm (29 inches) (Ap, A, and AB horizons); Cambic horizon - the zone from approximately 74 to 163 cm (29 to 64 inches) (the Bw1 and Bw2 horizons). Udic moisture\nregime.\nWorthen soils are not saturated, within a depth of 183 cm (72 inches), for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years. The moderately well drained phase (SIR IL033) does not meet the Oxyaquic criteria. A cherty phase is recognized in areas that contain more than 15 percent chert throughout the series control section. These phases need to be evaluated as subset soil surveys in which it occurs are updated.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Particle size data are on file for several pedons of the Worthen soils at the NRCS MLRA Office Region 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
