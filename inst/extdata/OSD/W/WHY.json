  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Why soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains.  Flooding is occasional, shallow and very brief.  In undisturbed areas the proximal end floods more often than the distal end.  Elevations range from 300 to 2000 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in stratified fan alluvium from mixed sources.  The climate is hot, arid continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to l0 inches, occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  The mean annual air temperature is 69 to 76 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days."
