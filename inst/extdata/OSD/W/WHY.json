  "OVERVIEW": "The Why series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in stratified fan alluvium.  Why soils are on alluvial fans and flood plains and have slopes of about 1 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 7 inches (180 mm), and the mean annual air temperature is about 71 degrees F (22 degrees C).",

These soils formed in stratified fan alluvium from mixed sources.  The climate is hot, arid continental.  The mean annual precipitation is 4 to 10 inches (100 to 250 mm), occurring as summer thunderstorms and gentle winter rain.  The mean annual air temperature is 69 to 76 degrees F (21 to 24 degrees C).  The frost-free period is 240 to 325 days."
