  "OVERVIEW": "The Waumac series consists of deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils.  These soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and igneous sources and are on valley floors and footslopes.  Slopes range from 1 to 20 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 13 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

The change was made to be consistent with the assigned moisture regime.\nWaumac and Lindrith series may not adequately compete. Consideration should be given to the need for both these series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
