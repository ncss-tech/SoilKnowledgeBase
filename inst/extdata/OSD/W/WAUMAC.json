Ashollow, Otero and Pitchdraw soils are in the Western Great Plains and Irrigated Region (LRR-G) and Central Great Plains Winter Wheat and Range Region (LRR-H) and are moist in May and June. Lindrith soils have soil temperatures less than 52 degrees F. and are moist for longer periods during the winter."

Elevations range from 5,200 to 6,500 feet. The mean annual precipitation is 12 to 14 inches and the mean annual temperature is 50 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 130 days."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric Epipedon - The zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 3 inches (A horizon).\nEntisol Feature - The lack of diagnostic horizons (C1, C2 horizons).\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999; Keys to Soil Taxonomy Tenth Edition, 2006.\nReclassified from a Typic subgroup to an Aridic subgroup in 2007. The change was made to be consistent with the assigned moisture regime.\nWaumac and Lindrith series may not adequately compete. Consideration should be given to the need for both these series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
