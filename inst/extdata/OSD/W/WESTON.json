  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of solum ranges from about 36\nto 56 inches thick.\nThe A horizon is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, or loamy fine sand.\nThe A1 or Ap horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2), grayish\nbrown (10YR 5/2), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or very dark gray\n(10YR 3/1).  The A2 horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) or\npale brown (10YR 6/3); some pedons have values of 5 or chromas of\n1, and mottles of brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) or yellowish brown\n(10YR 5/8).\nThe B2tg horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1) or light gray 10YR 7/1)\nmottled with shades of yellow and brown; textures include sandy\nloam or loam.  Clay content of the B2tg horizon ranges from 5 to\n18 percent, silt content is 20 to 50 percent, and the horizon\ncontains more than 15 percent of material coarser than very fine\nsand.  Reaction of the B horizons ranges from very strongly acid\nto extremely acid.\nAverage texture of the stratified C horizon ranges from sandy loam\nto loam.\nCompeting Series:  These are the Caddo,\nLeaf, Myatt, Rains, and Smithton series.  All except Smithton\nsoils are finer textured and contain more than 18 percent clay in\nthe B horizons.  Smithton soils have sola thicker than 60 inches."

The soil formed in coarse to moderately fine\ntextured, stratified marine and fluvatile deposits."
