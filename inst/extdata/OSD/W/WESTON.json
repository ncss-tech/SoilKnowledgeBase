The A2 horizon is light brownish gray (10YR 6/2) or\npale brown (10YR 6/3); some pedons have values of 5 or chromas of 1, and mottles of brownish yellow (10YR 6/8) or yellowish brown (10YR 5/8).\nThe Btg horizon is gray (10YR 5/1, 6/1) or light gray 10YR 7/1) mottled with shades of yellow and brown; textures include sandy loam or loam.  Clay content of the B2tg horizon ranges from 5 to\n18 percent, silt content is 20 to 50 percent, and the horizon contains more than 15 percent of material coarser than very fine sand.  Reaction of the B horizons ranges from very strongly acid\nto extremely acid.\nAverage texture of the stratified C horizon ranges from sandy loam to loam."

Some of the stream terraces have undulating relief consisting of a succession of shallow depressions and low ridges.  Slope gradient seldom exceeds 3 percent.  The soil formed in coarse to moderately fine textured, stratified marine and fluvatile deposits."
