  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature is about 40 degrees F., and mean summer soil temperature is about 51 degrees F.  Depth to uniformly calcareous material ranges from 11 to 36 inches.  Exchangeable sodium ranges from 0 to 15 percent in most of the control section and there are no subhorizons more than 4 inches thick above 20 inches that exceed 15 percent.  Depth to the calcic horizon ranges from 15 to 36 inches.  Depth to the sandy-skeletal substratum ranges from 20 to 36 inches.  The control section is typically sandy clay loam, loam or clay loam but averages 18 to 35 percent clay, 5 to 55 percent silt, and 15 to 75 percent sand with more than 15 percent fine or coarser sand.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 35 percent in a major part of the control section and are mainly 0 to 10 inches in diameter.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It has none to many large prominent mottles but is usually distinctly mottled in some part. This horizon is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe B2 horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7.5YR, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist, and chroma of neutral through 2.  It has few distinct to many prominent mottles This horizon ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Cca horizon has hue of 5Y through 7.5YR. It is moderately or strongly alkaline and has 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Walden soils are on nearly level to strongly sloping terraces, flood plains, outwash plains, and alluvial fans.  Slopes typically range from about 0 to 12 percent. These soils formed in moderately thin medium to moderately fine textured mixed alluvium overlying beds of sand and gravel.  At the type location the mean annual precipitation is about 9 inches with peak periods of precipitation in the spring and summer.  Mean annual temperature is 38 degrees F. and mean summer temperature is 57 degrees F."

Fleer soils have a mollic epipedon more than 20 inches thick, lack a calcic horizon, and have sandy loam in the upper part of the control section.  Giradot soils lack a mollic epipedon, calcic horizon, and sandy-skeletal substratum."
