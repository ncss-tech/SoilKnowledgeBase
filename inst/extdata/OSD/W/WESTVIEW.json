  "STATES": "KS,OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Westview series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on terraces that formed in calcareous silty sediments of Pleistocene age.  These soils are on nearly level low terraces above flood plains in the Central Rolling Red Plains.  Slopes are 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 23 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 61 degrees F.",

Soils in similar families are the Abilene, Altus, Blanket, Brewer, Carey, Cuero, Dale, Dodson, Farnum, McLain, Mingo, Smithville, Texroy, Tipton, and Wolco series.  Abilene, Blanket, Brewer, Dodson, McLain, Mingo, and Wolco soils have fine control sections.  Altus, Cuero, Farnum, Smithville, Texroy, and Tipton soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Corbin, Pond Creek, and St. Paul soils have soft powdery lime at depths greater than 30 inches.  In addition, Corbin and Pond Creek soils are in more moist climate.  Carey soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Dale soils lack Bt horizons."
