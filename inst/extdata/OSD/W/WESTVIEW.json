  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Corbin, Pond Creek, and St. Paul series in the same family.  Soils in similar families are the Abilene, Altus, Blanket, Brewer, Carey, Cuero, Dale, Dodson, Farnum, McLain, Mingo, Smithville, Texroy, Tipton, and Wolco series.  Abilene, Blanket, Brewer, Dodson, McLain, Mingo, and Wolco soils have fine control sections.  Altus, Cuero, Farnum, Smithville, Texroy, and Tipton soils have fine-loamy control sections.  Corbin, Pond Creek, and St. Paul soils have soft powdery lime at depths greater than 30 inches.  In addition, Corbin and Pond Creek soils are in more moist climate.  Carey soils have mollic epipedons less than 20 inches thick.  Dale soils lack Bt horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in calcareous silty sediments of Pleistocene age.  The climate is dry subhumid.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 20 to 27 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 57 to 65 degrees F.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 33 to 44.  Frost free days range from 190 to 230.  Elevation ranges from 1200 to 2000 feet."
