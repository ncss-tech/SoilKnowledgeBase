  "OVERVIEW": "The Westport series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand. These soils are on dunes and have slopes of 3 to 20 percent. The mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F. and the mean annual precipitation is about 70 inches.",

These soils are in a coastal marine climate with relatively cool summers and mild, wet winters. The annual precipitation is 60 to 120 inches, the average January temperature is about 40 degrees F.; the average July temperature is about 61 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F. The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 180 to 250 days."
