  "OVERVIEW": "The Williamsport series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that are deep to dense till. Williamsport soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying loamy outwash and till. They are on ground moraines and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 940 mm (37 inches), and mean annual temperature is 11 degrees C (51 degrees F).",
