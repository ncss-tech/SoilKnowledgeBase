Mean annual temperature ranges from 10.0 to 11.1 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F). Frost-free period is 150 to 180 days."

The Brenton soils have less clay in the subsoil and are on similar landscape positions or on terraces and outwash plains. The poorly drained Drummer soils are in depressions. The Elliott soils have a thinner mantle of loess or silty material and are on similar landscape positions. The moderately well drained Markham, Proctor, Symerton, and Varna soils are on slightly higher lying landscape positions."

Depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 15 to 61 cm (0.5 to 2.0 feet) between December and April in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and moderately low in the underlying till substratum. Permeability is moderate in the silty and loamy sediments and moderately slow in the lower part of the solum formed in till, and slow in the underlying till substratum."
