  "OVERVIEW": "The Watah series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic material over alluvium. The Watah soils are on flood plains. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 580 millimeters and the mean annual air temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
