  "OVERVIEW": "The Wolftail series consists of shallow, very poorly drained soils that formed in volcanic ash mixed with alluvium over residuum from metasedimentary rock. These soils occur on drainageways on cirque platforms. Slopes are 0 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 1,475 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.",
