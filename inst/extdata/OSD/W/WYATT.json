  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyatt series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in stratified clayey lacustrine sediments on old valley fill terraces in abandoned preglacial drainage systems of the foothills of the Allegheny Plateau.\nPermeability is moderate or moderately slow in the upper part of the solum and slow to very slow in the lower part of the solum. Slope ranges from 1 to 25 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F near the type location.",
