  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the solum and depth to carbonates range from 36 to 60 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 80 inches. A silty mantle ranges up to 12 inches. The particle size control section is 45 to 60 percent clay; however the middle and lower parts of the subsoil and substratum typically have clay contents greater than 60 percent. The lower part of the solum typically has slickensides or stress surfaces that have chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. Some pedons have A horizons, 1 to 4 inches thick, that have value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Reaction ranges\nfrom very strongly acid to moderately acid unless limed.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 8. Redoximorphic features have hues of 7.5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 8 in the upper 10 inches. Texture is silty clay or clay and less commonly\nin the upper part has thin subhorizons of silty clay loam. It contains 40 to 60 percent clay in the upper part and exceeds 60 percent clay in the lower part. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to extremely acid.\nThe BC horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 to 6. Textures are typically stratified silty clay or clay. Average clay content of the strata ranges from about 55 to 85 percent clay. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, but thin subhorizons of 7.5YR or 5YR may be present. It has value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. Textures are typically stratified silty clay or clay with thin strata of silty clay loam or silt loam. Average clay content of the strata ranges from about 55 to 85 percent clay. Varving is typically present. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to mildly alkaline."

Cardington, Ellsworth, Pert, and Shinrock soils average less than 45 percent clay in the argillic horizon and the content of clay decreases from the B to the C horizon. Geeburg soils contain rock fragments in the solum. Glynwood and Mortimer soils have a densic contact within a depth of 60 inches and average less than 60 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section."
