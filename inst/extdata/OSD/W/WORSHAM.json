  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:\nThere are no other series in this family. Chickahominy, Gertie, Pooler, Pouncey, and Roanoke are similar soils in related families. Chickahominy, Gertie and Pooler soils are formed in coastal plain sediments.  Roanoke soils occur on stream terraces and formed in alluvial sediments. Pouncey soils have an abrupt textural change (clay increase) at the top of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:\nWorsham soils are in depressions, at the heads of drains, at the base of slopes, and on upland flats in the Piedmont Plateau. The slopes are generally concave or slightly convex. Slope is dominately between 1 and 4 percent, but ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Worsham soils formed in local alluvium derived from granite, gneiss or schist. Annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 degrees F to 59 degrees F. The growing season is 180 to 210 days."
