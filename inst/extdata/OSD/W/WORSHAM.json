That requirement was previously added to differentiate Worsham and Roanoke soils. The 2007 revision moves the type location to the typical pedon for the Brunswick County, Virginia soil survey.  The 2025 revision changed the format. No data was changed\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 15 centimeters (0 to 10 inches) (Ap and Eg horizons)\nAquic conditions--periodic saturation and reduction in a zone from 13 to 152 centimeters (5 to 60 inches) at some time during the year.\nArgillic horizon-the zone from 15 to 89 centimeters (10 to 35 inches) (Btg horizons)"
