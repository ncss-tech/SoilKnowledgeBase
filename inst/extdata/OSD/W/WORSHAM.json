Chickahominy, Gertie and Pooler soils are formed in coastal plain sediments.  Roanoke soils occur on stream terraces and formed in alluvial sediments. Pouncey soils have an abrupt textural change (clay increase) at the top of the argillic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

The slopes are generally concave or slightly convex. Slope is dominately between 1 and 4 percent, but ranges from 0 to 8 percent. Worsham soils formed in local alluvium derived from granite, gneiss or schist. Annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 45 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 37 degrees F to 59 degrees F. The growing season is 180 to 210 days."
