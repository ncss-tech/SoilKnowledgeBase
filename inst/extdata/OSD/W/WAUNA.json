  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is saturated with water in some part throughout the year and is subject to fresh water overflow during spring floods and high tides unless diked and artificially drained.  They have an irregular decrease in organic matter.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 53 to 55 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 dry and moist.  A thin overwash of sand or fine sand less than 4 inches thick overlies this horizon in some areas.\nThe Bg horizon has value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 1 or 2 moist.  It has distinct to prominent mottles.  It is a silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  In some pedons, this horizon has thin lenses of peaty material with moist value of 2 or 3 and moist chroma of 1 in the 10YR hue.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or neutral, value of 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 moist.  It is composed of stratified material ranging from silt loam to sandy loam.  Redox concentrations are distinct or prominent with some areas having dark brown (7.5YR 3/2) hardened pore surfaces up to 1/4 inch in diameter formed in tubular pores and channels.  Thin layers of gray (10YR 6/1) ash-like material are in some pedons.  Peat or muck lenses are below 60 inches in some pedons."

They are at elevations of 10 to 20 feet in a climate with warm moist summers and cool wet winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 50 to 80 inches.  Mean July temperature is 62 to 68 degrees F, mean January temperature is 36 to 40 degrees F, and mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."
