    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The soil between 6 and 18 inches is moist in all parts from January 1 to May 15 and dry in all parts from July 1 to November 1. Cracks range from 2 to 8 cm wide at the surface and are 1 cm wide to a depth of 20 to 30 inches from May 15 to November 15 where not irrigated. Intersecting slickensides occur in the lower A and in the Bss horizons.  Redoximorphic features occur within 40 inches of the soil surface.  In some pedons, redoximorphic features occur throughout the soil profile.\nThe A horizon has color of 2.5Y 5/2; 5Y 5/1, 4/1 or 4/2. Moist color is 2.5Y 3/2 or 5Y 3/2. Organic matter content is 1 to 3 percent. Clay content is 50 to 60 percent. Electrical conductivity is less than 4 decisiemens per meter. The  sodium adsorption ratio is 1 to 10.\nThe B horizon has color of 2.5Y 4/2, 5/4, 6/4; 5Y 4/2 or 5/3. Moist color is 2.5Y 3/2, 4/4, 5/4; 5Y 3/2 or 4/3. Clay content is 45 to 60 percent. Electrical conductivity is 2 to 8 decisiemens per meter. The sodium adsorption ratio is 1 to 12. Gypsum crystals occur in some part."

These soils formed in mixed alluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock. Elevation is 110 to 185 feet. The climate is semiarid with hot dry summers and cool moist winters. The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches. The mean January temperature is 46 degrees F; mean July temperature is 79 degrees F; and mean annual temperature is 60 to 64 degrees F. The frost-free season is 210 to 280 days."

Britto and Turlock soils, on valley basin rims, have a natric horizon. Chateau soils, on fan skirts and low alluvial fans, have mixed mineralogy class and do not develop wide cracks when dry. Dospalos soils, on valley basins, do not have intersecting slickensides. Elnido soils, on flood plains, basin floors and valley basins, have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Marcuse Triangle and Trulae soils, on valley basin rims and valley basins,  are saline-sodic."
