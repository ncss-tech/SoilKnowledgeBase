The soil between the depths of 20 and 53 cm is moist in some or all parts for 135 to 150 days from about December 15 to May 15.  It is dry in all parts for 200 to 225 days from about May 15 to December 15; aridic moisture regime bordering on aquic.  The petrocalcic horizon is at a depth of 51 to 102 cm.  Eroded phases are recognized.\nThe An horizon color is 2.5Y 6/2, 7/2, 8/2; 10YR 5/2, 6/2, 7/1, 7/2 or 8/1.  Moist color is 2.5Y 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 7/2; 10YR 3/2, 3/4, 4/3, 4/4 or 6/2.
