  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from about 60 to  80 inches or more.  The soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid, except the surface layer in areas that have been limed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6; or hue of 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4; or hue 10YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, or loamy sand.\nThe upper part of the Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is sandy clay loam, clay loam, sandy clay, or clay.  The upper 20 inches of the Bt horizon has 35 to 55 percent clay.  Ironstone cobbles and stones are few to many and are medium to coarse.\nThe lower part of the Bt horizon has the same color range as the upper part.  It is sandy clay loam, loam, sandy loam, or loamy sand.  In some pedons, thin layers of ferruginous concretions and ironstone fragments are below a depth of 40 inches; these may make up as much as 30 percent of the volume.  Also, some pedons have partially weathered green sand and ironstone ledges below a depth of 60 inches."

Albertville, Bengal, Brockroad, Carnasaw, Catharpin, Cullen, Enders, Endsaw, Fluvanna, Galilee, Gritney, Kirvin, Masada, Mattaponti, McQueen, and Urland soils have a solum that is 40 to 60 inches thick.  In addition:  Albertville soils have an argillic horizon with a matrix yellower than hue of 5YR; Bengal and Carnasaw soils have an irregular lower boundary over tilted shaly bedrock; Brockroad and Catharpin soils have a 2Bt horizon; Cullen soils are underlain by mixed Piedmont rocks; Enders, Endsaw, Nason, and Tatum soils have a paralithic contact at a depth ranging from 40 to 60 inches; Fluvanna soils formed in weathered schist and gneiss; Galilee, Gritney, Luverne, Mattaponi, and Totier soils do not have ironstone fragments; Kirvin soils have a stratified sandy loam and iron enriched sandstone C horizon.  Masada soils have quartz gravel throughout the solum; McQueen soils have mica throughout and commonly have stratified sandstone and loamy C horizons.  Urland soils are underlain by stratfieid sandstone and clayey sediments.  Badin, Bonwier, Cunningham, Cuthbert, and Vance have a solum that is between 20 and 40 inches thick. Remlap soils are clayey in the lower part of the Bt horizon and overlie interbedded shale and limestone.  Sweatman soils have a solum that is 20 to 48 inches thick and overlie thinly laminated clay shale and sandy loamy materials.  Uwharrie soils are underlain by mafic and felsic crystalline and pyroclastic rocks of the Piedmont Plateau.  Maben soils have a solum that is 20 to 48 inches thick, and the C horizon is thinly laminated soft shale, loam, clay, and limonitic lenses, and base saturation is greater than 35 percent.  Neshoba soils do not decrease in clay by more than 20 percent from the maximum within a depth of 60 inches from the surface, and the Bt horizon has a matrix with a color value of 3 or less.  Shubuta soils do not decrease in clay by more than 20 percent from the maximum within a depth of 60 inches from the surface, and the lower part of the Bt horizon is clay, clay loam, or sandy clay."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are on strongly sloping to steep uplands of the Southern Coastal Plain Major Land Resource Area.  Slopes range from 8 to 40 percent.  The soil formed in beds of clayey marine sediments of Eocene Age which contain appreciable amounts of weathered glauconite.  The climate is warm and humid.  Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 64 degrees Fahrenheit, and mean annual precipitation is 54 inches."
