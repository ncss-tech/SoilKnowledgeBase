Lomoine soils are dominated by fine gravel in the particle-size control section and are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative during the summer months.  Wala soils are intermittently moist for 10 to 20 days cumulative during the summer months, have rock fragments that are mainly andesite and welded tuff, and have mean annual soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C."

Slopes are 0 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 1,310 to 2,260 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, the mean annual temperature is 10 to 12 degrees C., and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
