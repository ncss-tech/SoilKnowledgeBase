    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is usually moist; it is dry less than 45 consecutive days between the depths of 4 and 12 inches following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 54 degrees F.  The difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperature is 5 to 9 degrees F.  The umbric epipedon is 10 to 20 inches.  It is extremely acid through strongly acid throughout the profile.  The solum is 40 to 60 inches thick. Clay decreases by 20 percent or more from the maximum between the surface and 60 inches.\nThe A and BA horizons have hue of 10YR, 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 1 through 3 moist and dry.  Clay content is 18 to 35 percent.  It has 7 to 10 percent organic matter.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 through 5 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 6 moist and dry.  Redox features only occur in the lower part of the argillic horizon.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam with 35 to 50 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel.\nThe BC and 2C horizon have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 7 moist, 6 through 8 dry and chroma of 2 through 8 moist and dry.  It is loam, clay loam or silty clay loam with 15 to 35 percent clay and 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Redox concentrations occur throughout this horizon."

Fendall and Reedsport soils are well drained and are 20 to 40 inches deep to bedrock.  Tolovana soils are well drained and are dominated by amorphous material. Fendall, Reedsport, and Tolovana soils are on adjacent mountain areas or on dissected sideslopes of terrace remnants."
