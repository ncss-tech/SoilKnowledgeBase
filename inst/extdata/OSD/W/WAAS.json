The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 49 degrees F.  The soils are dry in some part of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 percent of the time when the soil temperature is above 41 degrees F.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral to mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 4 through 6.  It is commonly loam, but ranges to loam or silty clay loam and contains 18 to 35 percent clay with less than 15 percent sand coarser than very fine sand.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon ranges in texture from loam to clay loam.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  It ranges from 0 to 25 percent rock fragments."
