  "OVERVIEW": "The Wonser series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash derived from dacite and residuum derived from basalt.  Wonser soils are on plateaus.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
