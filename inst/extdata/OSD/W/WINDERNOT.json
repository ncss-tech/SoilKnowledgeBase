Oxford soils are on steep side slopes adjacent to Windernot soils.  Parleys soils are on stream terraces.  Cachecan soils are fine-silty and somewhat poorly drained.  Oxford soils have a fine particle-size control section.  Parleys soils are fine-silty."

Endosaturation is present with an apparent seasonal high water table between 4.5 and 6 feet (deep to very deep free water occurrence classes) between March and June.  Cumulative annual duration class is Common.  These soils are susceptible to rare flooding between February and May."
