  "OVERVIEW": "The Windernot series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Windernot soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 46 degrees F.",
