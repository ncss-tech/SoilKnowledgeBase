The soil temperature is warmer than 47 degrees F from January 30 to December 1.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 64 degrees F.  The particle-size control section of 10 to 40 inches averages 18 to 35 percent clay dry.  Depth of lime ranges from 0 to 19 inches.\nThe A horizon dry color is 10YR 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/4; or 2.5Y 5/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 3/2, 3/3; or 2.5Y 3/2.  It is loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam and ranges from 18 to 40 percent clay content.  Some pedons have a clay overburden with 40 to 45 percent clay content.  Thickness ranges from 11 to 19 inches.  Disseminated lime is none or slightly effervescent.  Some pedons have up to 10 percent gravel.  Organic matter ranges from 1 to 2 percent.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon dry color is 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 6/6, 6/8, 7/3, 7/4, 7/6, 8/6; 2.5Y 5/4, 6/4, 6/6, 7/4, 7/6, 8/6; or 5Y 7/4.

Typically it is clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam, sandy loam, silt loam or silty clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay content.  In some pedons the lower part of the C horizon is clay loam or clay with 35 to 45 percent clay content, or stratified very gravelly loamy sand to gravelly sandy loam with 5 to 15 percent clay content and 15 to 30 percent gravel.  It is slightly or strongly effervescent with disseminated lime.  It is mildly or moderately alkaline."

Texture determined by modified Bouyoucos method.  Presence of lime determined by field HC1 double syringe kit.  Organic matter determined by Walkley-Black digestion method.\nThe activity class was added to the classification in March of 2003.
