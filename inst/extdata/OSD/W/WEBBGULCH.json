  "OVERVIEW": "The Webbgulch series consists of moderately deep, well-drained soils on ridges and shoulder slopes of mountains. Webbgulch soils formed in colluvium from andesitic basalt or basalt with a small amount volcanic ash. Slopes are 0 to 90 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches and mean annual temperature about 42 degrees F.",
