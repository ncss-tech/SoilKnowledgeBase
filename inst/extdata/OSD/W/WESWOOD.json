  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  The particle-size control section has a weighted average clay content of 18 to 35 percent.  Texture is mainly silt loam or silty clay loam.  However, strata about 1/8 to 2 inches thick of loamy very fine sand, very fine sandy loam, loam, silty clay loam, or clay loam range from few to many  in most pedons below a depth of 20 inches.  The organic carbon content is irregular in the control section and/or it ranges from 0.2 to 0.5 percent at a depth of 50 inches below the soil surface.  Effervescence ranges from very slight to violent and the reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  Moist hue range to 10YR.  Some pedons have moist value and chroma of 3 but they are less than 7 inches thick.  Texture is loam, silt loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Bw or Bk horizons have hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Moist hue range to 10YR.  In the upper part the texture is mainly silt loam but some subhorizons are very fine sandy loam, loam, or silty clay loam.  In the lower part or in the Bwb horizon the texture range includes silty clay loam or silty clay.  Some pedons have buried A horizons with dark colors in shades of brown or gray.  They are typically below a depth of 40 inches with texture of silt loam, silty clay loam, or silty clay.\nThe C horizon, where present, has hue of 2.5YR to 7.5YR, value 4 to 7, and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is stratified with loamy textures and bedding planes.  These materials are platy or massive and do not have soil structure."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no competing series in the same family.  Similar soils are the Aspermont, Clairemont, Clemville, Coarsewood, Guadalupe, Norwood, Sandow, Waelder, Wheatwood, Yomont, and Yahola series.  Aspermont soils have a regular decrease in organic matter.  Clairemont, Coarsewood, and Yomont soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Clemville, and Norwood soils are in the udic moisture regime.  Guadalupe and Yahola soils have coarse-loamy control sections.  In addition, Yahola soils do not have a cambic horizon.  Sandow soils have fine-loamy control sections and have siliceous mineralogy.  Waelder soils have coarse-loamy control sections and siliceous mineralogy.  Wheatwood soils are dry in the moisture control section for longer periods."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weswood soils are on nearly level to moderately sloping flood plains.  Slopes are mainly less than 1 percent but range up to 8 percent on side slopes above drainageways.  These soils formed in stratified, calcareous, loamy alluvium.   Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 40 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 65 to 69 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 220 to 280 days.  Elevation ranges from 200 to 800 feet.  Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 44 to 58."

Coarsewood and Yahola soils are on similar or slightly lower positions in the flood plain.  Gaddy soils are on lower positions in the flood plain and have a sandy control section.  Highbank and Ships are on similar or slightly higher positions in the flood plain.  They have more than 40 percent clay in the particle-size control section."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",

Runoff is negligible on 0 to 1 percent slopes, very low on 1 to 3 percent slopes, low on 3 to 5 percent slopes, and medium on 5 to 8 percent slopes.  The soil floods frequently, occasionally, and rarely at intervals ranging from more than once each year to once every 20 to 100 years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Mostly used for cropland with the main crops being cotton, corn, grain sorghum, and small grains. Some areas are in pecan orchards while others are producing  improved or common bermudagrass pastures.  Woody vegetation includes cottonwood, pecan, oak, elm, hackberry, and willow.  Native grasses include indiangrass, big bluestem, little bluestem, switchgrass, virginia wildrye, and beaked panicum."
