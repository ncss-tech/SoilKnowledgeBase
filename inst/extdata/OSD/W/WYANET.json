  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 24 to 40 inches. The depth to carbonates ranges from 20 to 40 inches. The thickness of the loess is less than 18 inches. The particle-size control section averages between 22 and 32 percent clay and between 15 and 40 percent fine sand or coarser.\nThe upper part of the series control section (Ap or A horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam, loam, or fine sandy loam. Clay loam and silty clay loam is allowed in severely eroded pedons. It is moderately acid to neutral. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 4 percent.\nThe next part of the series control section (Bt, 2Bt horizons) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6. It is dominantly loam or clay loam, but ranges to silty clay loam in the upper part where the silt cap is at the maximum thickness. Clay content ranges from 22 to 32 percent. Content of fine sand\nor coarser is dominantly between 20 and 40 percent but ranges to 5 percent in subhorizons in the upper part. It is moderately acid or slightly acid in the upper part and is moderately acid to neutral in the lower part. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.5 to 1.7g/cm3.\nThe lower part of the series control section (BC, 2BC, C, 2C horizons) has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam with clay content ranging from 10 to 20 percent and sand content ranging from 30 to 40 percent. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 10 percent. It is slightly or moderately\nalkaline and contains carbonates. In some pedons, the BC or 2BC horizons do not contain carbonates. Moist bulk density ranges from 1.60 to 1.85 g/cm3."
