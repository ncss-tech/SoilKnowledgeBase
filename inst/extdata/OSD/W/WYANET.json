  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyanet series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in calcareous loamy till or in as much as 46 cm (18 inches) of loess or other silty material and in the underlying calcareous loamy till. A cap of fine sandy loam sediments is at the surface in some areas. These soils are on till plains. Slope ranges from 0 to 18 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C (52 degrees F), and mean annual precipitation is about 940 mm (37 inches).",
