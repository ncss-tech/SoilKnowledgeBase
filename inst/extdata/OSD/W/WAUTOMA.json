  "OVERVIEW": "The Wautoma series consists of very deep poorly drained and very poorly drained soils on glacial lake basins, outwash plains, and stream and lake terraces.  These soils formed in a sandy outwash or eolian mantle, in a thin loamy transition layer, and in the underlying mostly clayey lacustrine deposits. Permeability is rapid in the sandy mantle, moderately rapid in the loamy transition layer, and slow or very slow in the clayey lacustrine deposits. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 31 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the sandy mantle ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the base of soil development ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid in the sandy mantle and in the loamy transition layer. Reaction ranges from slightly acid to neutral in the clayey lacustrine material.  .  Rock fragments typically are absent throughout the soil,  but a few pedons have as much as 5 percent in the sandy upper story.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is loamy sand or sand.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture loamy sand, loamy fine sand, sand, or fine sand.\nThe 2Bg horizon has hue of 10YR or, 2.5Y, 5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.\nThe 3Bg horizon (2Bg horizon in pedons without a loamy transition layer) has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y;  value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 1 to 6.  Chroma of 3 to 6 occurs with 7.5YR or 5YR hue.  Texture is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay.\nThe 3C horizon (2C horizon in pedons without a loamy transition layer) has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture typically is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay, but in many pedons there are thin strata of coarser texture. Clay content of the 2B and 2C horizons ranges from 35 to 55 percent."

The higher-lying well-drained Delton and the somewhat poorly drained Wyeville soils form a drainage sequence with the poorly drained and very poorly drained Wautoma soils.  Nearby, where the sands are deeper and do not have the underlying clayey deposits, are the moderately well drained Brems and Friendship, and excessively drained Plainfield soils.  In some places, near the 47 degrees F temperature line, the Wautoma soils are associated with the poorly drained Newson and somewhat poorly drained Meehan soils which are classified as frigid."
