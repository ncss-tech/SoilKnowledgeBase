  "OVERVIEW": "The Wellie series consists of very deep, somewhat excessively drained soils formed in colluvium from granitic rock.  These soils are on the backslopes of mountains, mainly on southerly aspects.  Slopes are 35 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches and mean annual temperature about 44 degrees F.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section is 40 to 75 percent angular rock fragments.  The solum ranges from 0 to 5 inches thick.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry, 1 or 2 moist.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly, very gravelly, extremely cobbly, or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 35 percent gravel, 20 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones."
