These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 75 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The particle-size control section is 40 to 75 percent angular rock fragments.  The solum ranges from 0 to 5 inches thick.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 dry, 1 or 2 moist.\nThe C horizons have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 dry or moist.  It is very cobbly, very gravelly, extremely cobbly, or extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 35 percent gravel, 20 to 40 percent cobbles, and 0 to 10 percent stones."

The average annual precipitation ranges from 18 to 24 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 22 to 26 degrees F, the average July temperature ranges from 62 to 67 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature ranges from 42 to 46 degrees F. The frost-free season is 95 to 120 days."

Doe soils are on backslopes of mountains and have a volcanic ash layer greater than 14 inches thick.  Wapal soils are on footslopes and backslopes of mountains, and on terraces and terrace escarpments.  These soils are formed in glacial outwash and ablation till, and have a vitrandic ash layer 7 to 14 inches thick."
