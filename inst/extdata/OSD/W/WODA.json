Crossen soils have an ustic-aridic soil moisture regime and 3 to 10 inch thick petrocalcic horizon. Upton soils receive more summer moisture and have a 4 to 36 inch thick petrocalcic horizon."

Elevations are 2,400 to 2,800 feet.  The climate is arid with cool winters and hot summers, typical of the Mojave Desert.  The mean annual precipitation is between 3 and 6 inches; mean annual temperature between 60 to 65 degrees F., and the frost-free season is 200 to 240 days."
