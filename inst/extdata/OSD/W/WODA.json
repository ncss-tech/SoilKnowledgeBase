  "STATES": "NV",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Woda series consists of shallow and very shallow over a petrocalcic horizon, well drained soils that formed in alluvium from limestone and reworked lacustrine deposits.  The Woda soils are on isolated fan remnants and fan piedmonts.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 6 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 64 degrees F.",
