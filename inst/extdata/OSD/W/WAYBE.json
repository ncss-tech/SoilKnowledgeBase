  "OVERVIEW": "The Waybe series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from clayey shale.  These soils are on foothills and mountain slopes.  Slopes are 5 to 65 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
