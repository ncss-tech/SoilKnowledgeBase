    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Bonnerdale, Dela, Kenn, Mazarn, and Speer series.  Bonnerdale soils are on adjacent uplands and are 40 to 60 inches deep to sandstone and/or shale bedrock.  Dela soils do not have B horizons and typically occur adjacent to the stream channel.  Kenn and Speer soils are in a fine-loamy particle size class and typically occur closer to the stream channel.  Mazarn soils are in a fine-loamy particle size class and are 20 to 40 inches deep to sandstone and/or shale bedrock.  They typically occur on similar landscapes as Woodall soils."

These soils are subject to flooding for very brief periods mainly during the winter and spring months.  An apparent water table occurs from 0.5 to 1.5 feet below the soil surface during the winter and spring months."
