  "OVERVIEW": "The Wenzel series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from intermediate and basic igneous rocks.  Wenzel soils occur on fan remnants and mountain slopes and have slopes of 15 to 40 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 19 inches, and the mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
