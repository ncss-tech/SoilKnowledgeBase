These soils are usually moist but are dry 50 to 85 consecutive days in the moisture control section during the summer.  The soil moisture regime is typic xeric.\nThe mollic epipedon is 17 to 20 inches thick and extends into the argillic horizon.  The combined thickness of the A and B horizon is 28 to 30 inches.  The particle size control section ranges from 35 to 44 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent gravel and cobble igneous rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value 3 moist, 2 dry and chroma is 2.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe BAt and Bt horizons has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture ranges from very gravelly clay loam, cobbly clay loam, very cobbly clay or very gravelly clay.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist and chroma of 3 or 4.  Texture ranges from very gravelly loam to very cobbly loam.  Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR, value 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist and chroma 3 or 4.  Texture ranges from extremely cobbly coarse sandy loam, very cobbly coarse sandy loam, extremely gravelly loamy coarse sand, or very gravelly sandy clay loam.

These soils formed in alluvium derived from intermediate and basic igneous rock.  The average annual precipitation is 16 to 22 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F., and the mean summer temperature is 60 to 63 degrees  F.  The frost-free period is 80 to 100 days."
