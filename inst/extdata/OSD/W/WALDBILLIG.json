  "OVERVIEW": "The Waldbillig series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash over material derived from till.  Waldbillig soils are on mountains and moraines. Slopes are 2 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 35 inches and mean annual temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
