  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Free carbonates are at a depth of 15 to 60 inches.  The control section ranges from medium acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3.  It is silt loam, silt, very fine sandy loam, or loam. The C horizon has hue of 2.5Y to 5YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  In some pedons, the C horizon has chroma of 1 or 2 below a depth of 20 inches.  It is commonly stratified very fine sandy loam, silt, and silt loam, but includes thin bands of loamy very fine sand, very fine sand, fine sand, and sand.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages between 1 and 15 percent clay and from 1 to 10 percent fine sand or coarser sand."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  This is the only series in this family.  Shiocton and Waupaca soils are in closely related families.  Shiocton soils formed in similar materials but have a cambic horizon.  Waupaca soils have horizons that are dominated by chroma of 2 or less below the surface layer."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Wega soils are on glacial lake basins and flood plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in stratified water-laid deposits which are dominantly silty.  Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 42 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 32 inches."

Alfalfa, corn, and oats are the common crops but some areas are used for growing specialty crops such as beans, cabbage, and sweet corn.  Some areas are in pasture or woodland.  The native vegetation was mixed hardwoods with some grasses."
