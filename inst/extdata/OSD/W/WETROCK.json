  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetrock series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed from mixed stream alluvium.  Wetrock soils are on flood plains and have slopes of 0 to 5 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 67 degrees F.",
