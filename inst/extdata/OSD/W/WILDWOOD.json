  "REVDATE": "02/2005",
  "STATES": "MN,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wildwood Series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in a thin mantle of organic soil material and in underlying clayey till or glacial lacustrine sediments on lake plains. These soils have slow or very slow\npermeability. They have slopes of 0 to 1 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 28 inches. Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Depth to free carbonates ranges from 18 to 35 inches. Rock fragments are typically lacking in the glaciolacustrine material but range up to 10 percent in the till material. In the mineral portion of the particle control section, the average content of clay is 60 to 75 percent.\nThe Oa horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 2 or 3, chroma of 1 or 2, or is N2/0 or N3/0. It is muck.  Some pedons have an Oe with mucky peat textures.  The fiber content of the O horizons is mostly herbaceous but part is of woody origin in some pedons. It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 or 1.  It has redoximorphic features in some pedons. It is typically clay or silty clay. Thin layers of clay loam or silty clay loam are in some pedons. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR 2.5Y or 5Y; value of 3 to 6; and chroma of 1 or 2. It has redoximorphic features in some pedons. It typically is clay but thin subhorizons of silty clay are within the range. It is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe Cg horizon has color and texture similar to the Bg horizon. However, (in some pedons below 40 inches) it has subhorizons of clay loam with as much as 10 percent rock fragments combined with strata of clay. Some pedons that formed in glaciolacustrine sediments may be varved with very thin laminations of silty clay loam, silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or concave slopes with a gradient of less 0 to 1 percent on glacial lake plains. They formed primarily in a thin layer of organic soil material and clayey till or glaciolacustrine sediments. These sediments are Late Wisconsinan in age. Mean annual temperature ranges from 35 to 45 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 19 to 30 inches.  The frost free period ranges from 88 to 135 days.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 785 to 1,350 feet."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Clearwater, Dora, Haug, Indus, Taylor Thiefriver, and Woodslake soils. Poorly and very poorly drained Clearwater and Thiefriver soils and the somewhat poorly and poorly drained Indus soils are on plane to slightly concave slopes that are slightly higher in the landscape. Very poorly drained Dora soils are in similar positions but have a thicker organic layer above the clayey sediments. Very poorly drained Haug soils in similar landscape positions are underlain by loamy till.  Moderately well drained Taylor soils are on convex slopes higher in the landscape.  Very poorly and poorly drained Woodslake soils are in similar landscape positions but do not have an organic layer."

The perched seasonal high water table is at depths ranging from 1 foot above to the surface at some time from September to June in most years for the undrained phase.
