They are in former lakes or ponds that range in size from a few acres to several hundred acres. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The Willette soils formed in organic materials 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 inches) thick overlying clayey deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 635 to 1016 mm (25 to 40 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 8.9 to 10.0 degrees C (48 to 50 degrees F)."

Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the organic materials and moderately low in the clayey material. Permeability is rapid in the organic layers and slow in the clayey material."
