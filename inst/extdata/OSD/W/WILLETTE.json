  "BYREV": "Rev. NWS-WEF",
  "REVDATE": "08/2012",
  "STATES": "IN,MI,NY,OH,WI",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Willette series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic materials 41 to 130 cm (16 to 51 inches) thick overlying clayey deposits. These soils are in depressions on lake plains, ground moraines, and end moraines. Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 813 mm (32 inches), and mean annual temperature is about 9.4 degrees C (49 degrees F).",

Depth to the top of a seasonal high water table ranges from 30 cm (1 foot) above the surface to 30 cm (1 foot) below the surface between November and May in normal years. Potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the organic materials and moderately low in the clayey material. Permeability is rapid in the organic layers and slow in the clayey material."
