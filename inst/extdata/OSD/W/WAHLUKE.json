The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees.  Depth to the laminated sediments with lime cemented lenses is 15 to 30 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  This horizon is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe IIC horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist,and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.  The lower part of the C horizon has a dry consistence that is hard or very hard.  It is silt loam and very fine sandy loam.  Some pedons contain thin beds of loamy fine sand or strata containing pebbles at depths greater than 40 inches."

Risbeck soils have weakly cemented lime silica fragments throughout and lack stratification in the control section.  Warden, Sagemoor and Shano soils lack cemented lime lenses in the particle size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wahluke soils are on lake beds and terraces at elevations of 750to 1,200 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 5 percent.  These soils formed in lacustrine sediments with a loess mantle.  Wahluke soils occur in an arid climate having an annual precipitation of 6 to 9 inches and with warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The average January temperature is 27 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 71 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 51 degrees F.  The frost free season is 136 to 210 days."
