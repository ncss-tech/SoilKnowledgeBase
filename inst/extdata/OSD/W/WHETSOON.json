  "OVERVIEW": "The Whetsoon series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Whetsoon soils are on floodplains and seeps on terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 centimeters (15 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C. (47 degrees F.) at the type location.",
