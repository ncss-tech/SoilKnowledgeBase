They are nearby on similar or more sloping parts of the landscape and form a drainage sequence with Weir soils. The somewhat poorly drained Marine soils have an abrupt textural change from the E horizon to the Bt horizon. They are on similar parts of the landscape nearby."

An intermittent perched seasonal high water table is within 1 foot (30 cm) of the surface at some time between January and June in normal years. This soil is subject to periods of occasional, very brief ponding at depths up to 15 cm (0.5 foot) from January to June in normal years. The potential for surface water runoff is high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low or moderately low (0.07 to 0.42 micrometers/sec) in the slowest layer. Permeability is very slow (0.01 to 0.06 inches per hour)."
