The mollic epipedon typically is 14 to 16 inches thick but ranges from 7 to 16 inches thick.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 3 to 5 dry and 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam, silt loam, or clay loam. It is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has 10YR or 2.5Y hue, value of 4 to 6 dry and 2 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4.   It is loam or clay loam and has 25 to 35 percent clay.  It has prismatic structure that separates to angular or subangular blocky structure or it is subangular blocky.  The Bt horizon is slightly acid to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have 10 to 35 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the horizon.\nThe bedrock typically is cemented calcareous sandstone, but in some pedons, it is limestone, hard shale, pseudoquartzite, or quartzite."

Bookcliff soils have bedrock at 40 to 60 inches.  Bullflat, Dooley, Empedrado, Fairfield, Farnuf, Felor, Greenway, Hangdo, Livona, Martinsdale, Trag, Vida, Williams, and Yegen soils are deep and do not have a lithic contact.  Gurney soils have redder hue in the argillic horizon.  Lefor, Lininger, and Reeder soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  Moen soils are noncalcareous throughout and overlie granite.  Wemple soils are deep with volcanic ash in the substratum.  Amor, Azaar, Rottulee, Sen, and Vebar soils do not have an argillic horizon.  In addition, Amor, Sen, and Vebar soils do not have a lithic contact.  Marmarth and Morton soils do not have a lithic contact.  In addition, Marmarth soils are drier and Morton soils are fine-silty."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

These soils formed in sedimentary material over hard bedrock.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 12 to 17 inches.  Most of the moisture falls in the spring and summer."

In addition, Belfield soils have natric horizons; Cabba and Wayden soils do not have mollic epipedons; and Moreau and Regent soils have fine textures.
