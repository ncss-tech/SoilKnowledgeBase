The soils are in a mild marine climate and have cool, moist summers an cool, wet winters.  mean annual precipitation is 90 to 100 inches. Average January temperature is about 39 degrees F., average July temperature is about 61 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F.  Frost-free season is 160 to 190 days."
