  "STATES": "AZ",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodcutter series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed slope alluvium weathered from granite and metamorphic rock. Woodcutter soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes range from 10 to 60 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches (406 mm) and the mean annual air temperature is about 60 degrees F (15.6 degrees C).",
