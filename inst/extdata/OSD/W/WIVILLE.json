    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wiville soils are on level to gently sloping dunes located on terraces of late Pleistocene age in the Western Lowlands of east Arkansas and southeast Missouri; MLRA-131.  Slopes range from 0 to 8 percent, but typically are 1 to 3 percent.  Wiville soils formed in loamy, eolian deposits.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 60 to 64 degrees F, and annual precipitation ranges from 45 to 55 inches."

Bulltown soils have a loamy control section and are somewhat excessively drained.  Askew soils have a fine-silty control section and are moderately well drained.  Bonn soils have a fine-silty control section and a natric horizon.  Bosket soils have dark colored surface layers and slightly higher base saturation.  Dubbs soils have a fine-silty control section.  Foley soils have a fine-silty control section and a natric horizon.  Forestdale soils have a fine control section and are poorly drained.  Tuckerman soils are poorly drained and have moderately slow permeability."

Farming operations such as cultivating, land leveling, shaping and smoothing have destroyed the original shape of most dunes.  Native vegetation is chiefly mixed hardwoods with native grasses in openings."
