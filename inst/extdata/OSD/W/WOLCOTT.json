    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 30 to 60 inches.  Gravel content is less than 5 percent in the A horizon and 5 to 10 percent in the B horizon.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or it is N and value of 2 or 3.  Most pedons have few or common, fine, faint, or distinct mottles in the lower part of the A horizon.  It is loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam, and neutral or slightly acid.\nThe B horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 1 or 2.  Mottles are common or many, fine to coarse, distinct or prominent.  It is loam or clay loam and weighted average is between 27 and 35 percent clay.  It is slightly acid or neutral.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y or N, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 0 through 6, and has distinct or prominent mottles.  Effervescence is slight to violent.  In places bedrock is at a depth of 40 to 60 inches."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are Clyde, Colwood, Faxon, Gansner, Kossuth, Letri, Reddick, Selma, Tripoli, and Webster.  Broomfield and Faxon soils have bedrock within 40 inches.  Clyde, Colwood, and Lyles soils have stratified lower sola.  Gansner soils are on higher elevations and receive more precipitation.  Letri soils occur in drier climates.  Reddick soils contain more silt in the lower part of the solum.  Selma soils are underlain by sand or loamy sand.  Kossuth soils are in a somewhat drier climate and are poorly drained.  Tripoli and Webster soils contain considerable amounts of montmorillonite."

Corwin soils have an argillic horizon and are on gently sloping areas.  Montmorenci soils lack mollic epipedons and are on gently sloping areas.  Odell soils have an argillic horizon and are on nearby higher topographic positions.  Rensselaer soils are in similar positions and have an argillic horizon."
