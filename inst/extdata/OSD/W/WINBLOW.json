  "OVERVIEW": "The Winblow series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in volcanic ash and loess.  They are on mounds and in depressions on nonglaicated plateaus. Slopes are 0 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The DelRio, Dryhollow, and Yellowhills series are very deep. The Deskamp soils lack a cambic horizon. Bitner soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches and have 50 to 90 percent glass. Emagert and Weezweed soils are over 40 inches deep. Brays soils are underlain by granite and the particle-size control section averages 15 to 35 percent rock fragments. Kester soils are slightly to strongly alkaline."
