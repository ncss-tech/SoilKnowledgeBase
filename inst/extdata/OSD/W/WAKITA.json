  "OVERVIEW": "The Wakita series consists of moderately deep, slowly permeable soils that formed in material weathered from residuum of interbedded sandstone and shale of Permian age or from thin loamy deposits over interbedded sandstone and shale of Permian age. These very gently sloping to gently sloping soils are on slightly convex hill slopes in the Central Rolling Red Prairies.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is 33 inches.  Mean annual temperature is 60 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum and depth to bedrock ranges from 24 to 40 inches.  The Ap horizon has color value, moist, of 3 or less and a color value, dry, of 5 or less (crushed and smoothed sample), and a chroma of 3 or less, or materials between the soil surface and a depth of 18 cm have these colors after mixing.  It has a base saturation of 50 percent or more in all horizons between the upper boundary of the natric horizon and a depth of 60 inches.  It has visible crystals of gypsum or more soluble salts, or both within 16 inches of the mineral soil surface.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Moist values are 2 to 4.  However, after mixing, the upper 18 cm must meet the mollic criteria above.  It is loam or silt loam and fragments of sandstone and shale from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to 2 percent by volume.  Structure is massive, platy, granular, or blocky.  This horizon ranges from moderately acid to strongly alkaline.  It has sodium absorption ratio of 10 to 30 and an electrical conductivity of 0 to 15.\nThe Btn horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, chroma of 2 to 6.  It is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam with a clay content of 25 to 35 percent.  Fragments of sandstone and shale from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter make up 0 to 10 percent by volume.  The structure is columnar or prismatic, or blocky with tongues of eluvial material that has some uncoated silt or sand grains.  The reaction ranges from neutral to strongly alkaline.\nThe Btny1 and Btny2 horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6.  Some pedons have mottles or red, yellow, or brown.  Texture is silt loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam. Some pedons have fragments of sandstone and shale from 2 mm to 76 mm in diameter that make up 0 to 15 percent by volume.  The reaction ranges from slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline.  The B horizon has a sodium absorption ratio ranging from 13 to 100 and an electrical conductivity value from 0 to 16.  Most pedons have seams of soluble salts or gypsum crystals at some time during the year.\nThe Cr or C horizon has hue of 2.5YR or 5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 8 but a few pedons have hue of 5Y or 5GY, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is interbedded sandstone and shale that can be cut with a spade.  This rock like material is non-paralithic and has low to moderate excavation difficulty.  Fractures are greater than 10 cm apart.   The material is dense enough to be root restrictive.  It slakes in water within 15 hours."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series of the same family. Soils in similar families are Drummond, Foard, Hinkle, Oscar, Pawhuska, and Wing series.  These soils have a fine particle-size control section.  Drummond soils have a water table within 24 to 80 inches and are subject to flooding.  Foard soils have a mollic epipedon and montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Hinkle soils are dry for longer periods of time and have montmorillonitic mineralogy.  Oscar soils are on flood plains and do not have an A horizon with moist value of 3 or less.  Wing soils have wetness mottles within 20 inches of the soil surface."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wakita soils occur on very gently sloping to gently sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 1 to 5 percent.  These soils occur as seeps on side slopes in slightly convex, circular areas about 10 to 200 feet in diameter or elongated areas of 20 to 200 feet in width and up to 600 feet in length.  These soils have formed in material weathered from interbedded sandstone and shale of Permian age or from thin loamy deposits over interbedded sandstone and shale of Permian age.  The climate is moist subhumid.\nMean Annual Precipitation: 26 to 40 inches;\nmean Annual Temperature: 58 to 64 degrees F.;\nThornthwaite Annual P-E indices: 44 to 64.\nSoil Moisture Regime:  Udic-Ustic"

Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 22 inches (A and upper Bt horizons).\nNatric horizon - the zone from 5 inches to a depth of 32 inches (Btn horizons)\nCr horizon - the rock like, non paralithic  material encountered at a depth of 32 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Unpublished thesis of Thomas Glynn Reinsch, comparative study of slickspots in Grant County, Oklahoma.
