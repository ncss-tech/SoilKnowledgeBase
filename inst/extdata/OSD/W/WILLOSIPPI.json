    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free calcium carbonate ranges from 24 to 50 inches.  Weighted average clay content of the argillic ranges from 10 to 30 percent.  There are no rock fragments in the series control section.  Reaction is strongly acid to neutral in the upper part of the solum and moderately acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part.  The underlying material is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2.  The uncultivated A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or is neutral with value of 2, and ranges from  3 to 5 inches thick.  The A horizons are loam, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or sandy loam.\nThe Eg horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 1 or 2 with some high chroma Fe concentrations in most pedons.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 2.5Y, 5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6 and dominant chroma of 2 with Fe concentrations.  It is stratified with textures of clay loam, loam, silty clay loam, and silt loam, but includes thin strata of loamy sand, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy fine sand, loamy very fine sand and very fine sandy loam. Significant strata are considered subhorizons.   Distinct or faint clay films are on the faces of peds.  Clay films in root channels are distinct or prominent.  The sandier subhorizons have clay bridging of sand grains.\nThe BCg and Cg horizons have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or 10YR, value of 5 to 7 and dominant chroma of 2 with Fe concentrations.  Textures are similar to those of the Btg horizon.\nWhere present, Bkg horizons have hue of 5Y to 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 or 3 with Fe concentrations.  Textures are similar to the Btg and Cg horizons."
