  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 52 degrees F.  The particle-size control section is silt loam, or silty clay loam and has 22 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Depth to mottles is 10 to 24 inches.  The mollic epipedon is 20 to 40 inches thick.  The soil is dry throughout the moisture control section for 90 or more consecutive days after the summer solstice.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  The soil reaction ranges from mildly or moderately alkaline with slight or strong effervescence.\nThe C and 2C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam, and may be gravelly below 40 inches."

Wingville soils formed in mixed alluvium and have an influence of volcanic ash in the upper horizons.  The mean annual precipitation is 9 to 14 inches.  The mean annual temperature is 45 to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 110 to 160 days."
