    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness typically is 50 to 60 inches but ranges from 40 to more than 65 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 10 to 24 inches in thickness.  These soils have less than 10 percent sand in the series control section.  Reaction is moderately acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has color value of 2 or 3, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3.\nThe Bt horizon has color value of 3 or 4 and chroma of 2 to 4 in the upper part, and value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4 in the lower part.  Mottles of both high and low chroma are evident in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  It is silty clay loam or silt loam.  Clay percentage averages 27 to 35 percent, but ranges to 25 percent.\nThe C horizon has color value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It commonly is silt loam, but silty clay loam is within the range.  Mottles have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6."

Ashdale, Assumption and Keltner soils have 2B horizons that average more than 35 percent clay.  Barrington, Elkhart and Graymont soils have free carbonates at depths of 20 to 40 inches.  Broadwell and Richwood soils have sandy textures at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Catlin soils have free carbonates at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Cotter, Reading, Sibley, Troxel and Wiota soils have mollic epipedons more than 24 inches thick.  Dana, Dinsdale, Douglas, Harrison, Meadowbank, Ogle, Plano, Proctor, Saybrook, Sidell, Toddville and Waupecan soils have 2B or 3B horizons with more than 15 percent sand.  Elmont soils have a paralithic contact at depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Healing soils commonly have coarse fragments in the lower one-third of the series control section.  Malcolm and Mendota soils have solum thickness less than 40 inches.  Ripon soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches.  Tama soils are more cool in the soil temperature control section and are more moist in the moisture control section during the 120 days following the summer solstice."

Higginsville soils have 2 chroma mottles within 6 inches below the mollic epipedon and are on side slopes below Wakenda soils.  Knox soils do not have a mollic epipedon and are on narrower ridgetops and steeper side slopes below Wakenda soils.  Sharpsburg soils are in the fine textural family and are on similar landscapes."
