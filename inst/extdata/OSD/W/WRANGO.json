  "OVERVIEW": "The Wrango series consists of very deep, excessively drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks. Wrango soils are on alluvial fans, stream terraces and inset fans. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 200 mm and mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",
