Burbank soils have dominantly loamy sand or loamy fine sand particle-size control sections. Crunkvar and Denio soils contain 35 to 60 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section. Doowak soils have soil temperature of 8 to 11 degrees C and is noneffervescent in the top 50 cm. Sheeprock soils lack a Bk horizon. Skaha soils are neutral and noncalcareous. Ulymeyer soils have particle-size control section that is dominated by cobbles and stones."
