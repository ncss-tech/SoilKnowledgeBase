  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is about 54 to 59 degrees F.  The soil is usually moist in some part between depths of 8 and 24 inches from late November to late April or early May and is continuously dry the rest of the time.  There is a 3 to 10 percent clay increase from the A to the B horizon.  The solum has 5 to 15 percent gravel in the A and Bt horizons and 15 to 25 percent gravel in the B23tb horizon.  It is slightly acid or neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon is brown, dark brown, yellowish brown, or light yellowish brown (10YR 5/3, 4/3, 5/4, 6/4).  Organic carbon is 0.4 to 0.6 percent.  This horizon is loamy sand or sandy loam.\nThe Bt horizon is strong brown, brown, light brown, reddish yellow, or yellowish red (7.5YR 5/6, 5/4, 5/2, 6/4, 6/6; 5YR 5/6).  Yellowish red colors are usually in the lower part of the Bt horizon.  Structure is weak or moderate fine to coarse angular, subangular blocky or prismatic.  Depth to the upper boundary of the B23tb horizon is about 40 to 55 inches and lower boundaries are below a depth of 6 or 6 1/2 feet in some pedons.  The B23tb horizon is brown, strong brown, reddish brown, or yellowish red (7.5YR 5/2, 5/4, 5/6; 5YR 5/4, 5/6).  It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly sandy clay loam."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wrightwood soils are on terraces and have slopes of 2 to 9 percent.  They formed from older, mixed alluvium dominantly from granitic sources.  Elevations are 3,900 to 4,300 feet.  The climate is subhumid mesothermal having warm, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 18 inches of which 1/3 to 1/2 falls as snow of short duration.  The average January temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 68 to 74 degrees F.; and the mean annual temperature is 54 to 58 degrees F.  The frost free season is 160 to 190 days."
