  "OVERVIEW": "The Wintermute series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed alluvium derived from limestone, dolomite and slate.  Wintermute soils are on fan remnants, fan skirts, and beach plains.  Slopes are 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 180 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 18 cm. (A1 and part of the A2 horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 38 to 79 cm. (2Bqk1 horizon)\nDuric feature - The zone from 38 to 79 cm. (2Bqk1 horizon)\nParticle size control section - The zone from 25 to 100 cm (2Bqk1 horizon and parts of the A3 and 2Bqk2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon within 5 miles of the series type location was sampled for full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S89NV-007-004.  That pedon is a taxadjunct to the Wintermute series because it has carbonatic instead of mixed mineralogy.  It also is moderately saline and moderately sodic.  Further study of the series concept is needed to determine the dominant mineralogy class and chemical properties.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
