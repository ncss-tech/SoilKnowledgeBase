  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wilpar soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions.  These soils formed mainly in residuum, with minor amounts of colluvium, weathered from rhyodacitic tuff.  Rock outcrops occur in complex with these soils.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 6,800 to 7,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with most of it coming as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 43 degrees F. and the frost-free period is about 80 days."

Homestake soils are very deep, have weakly silica and carbonate cemented horizons, and have frigid temperature regime.  Tica soils are shallow to lithic contacts.  Udel soils are very shallow to lithic contacts and do not have argillic horizons.  Winu soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have thick mollic epipedons.  Winz soils are very deep and have ochric epipedons and albic horizons above argillic horizons."

The vegetation is a forest canopy of singleleaf pinyon with a sparse understory of mountain big sagebrush and associated grasses and forbs.  Some Utah juniper, curlleaf mountainmahogany, and serviceberry are also present."
