These soils formed mainly in residuum, with minor amounts of colluvium, weathered from rhyodacitic tuff.  Rock outcrops occur in complex with these soils.  Slopes are 30 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 6,800 to 7,800 feet.  The climate is semiarid with cold, moist winters and cool, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 14 to 16 inches with most of it coming as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 42 to 43 degrees F. and the frost-free period is about 80 days."

Udel soils are very shallow to lithic contacts and do not have argillic horizons.  Winu soils are fine-loamy, moderately deep to lithic contacts, and have thick mollic epipedons.  Winz soils are very deep and have ochric epipedons and albic horizons above argillic horizons."
