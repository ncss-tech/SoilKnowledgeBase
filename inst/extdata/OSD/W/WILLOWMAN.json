Depth to carbonates is 7 to 30 inches.\nThe A1 horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3. The matrix material is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam. It is 15 to 45 percent pebbles and 0 to 5 percent cobbles and stones. This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 2 through 4 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4. The matrix material is fine sandy loam or sandy clay loam with 18 to 35 percent clay. It is 15 to 40 percent pebbles and 0 to 35 percent cobbles and stones. This horizon is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR. The matrix material commonly is sandy loam but is loamy sand as shallow as 19 inches, and sand below 40 inches, in some pedons. It is 35 to 55 percent pebbles, 5 to 25 percent cobbles and stones. The Cca horizon has a strong accumulation of calcium carbonates ranging from 15 to 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent that decreases more than 5 percent with increasing depth."
