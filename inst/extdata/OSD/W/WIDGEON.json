  "OVERVIEW": "The Widgeon series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils formed in loamy glaciofluvial deposits.  These soils are found on side slopes of moraines.  Permeability is moderate in the upper part of the solum and moderately slow in the rest of the soil.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 32 inches.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",
