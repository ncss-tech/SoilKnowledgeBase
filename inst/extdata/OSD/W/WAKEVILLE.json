    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 24 to 45 inches. Rock fragments generally are less than 5 percent in the surface layer and subsoil but range to 20 percent in the substratum and up to 45 percent below 40 inches. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to neutral to a depth of 40 inches and from moderately acid to moderately alkaline below 40 inches.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. Texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Thickness of the A horizon ranges from 2 to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 6. The texture is very fine sandy loam or silt loam. Structure is fine or medium subangular blocky or granular.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 or 2. The texture is silt loam or very fine sandy loam. Structure is subangular blocky or granular.\nThe Cg or C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 5 or 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. The texture is silt loam, loam, or very fine sandy loam above 40 inches, and ranges to fine sandy loam or loamy sand below 40 inches in the fine earth fraction. The horizon is massive, or has plate like divisions. Consistence is very friable to firm.\nSome pedons have a 2C horizon below 40 inches with hue of 10YR through 5Y, value of 3 through 6, and chroma of 1 through 4. Texture ranges from loam to loamy sand in the fine earth fraction. Some pedons have strata of fine sand or sand below 40 inches. The horizon is massive. Consistence is very friable or friable."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: The Limerick series is the only soil in the same family. Limerick soils are poorly drained, and do not have a Bw horizon in the upper subsoil.\nThe Holderton, Maplehill, Raypol, Raynham, Wakeland, Wayland, and Wyalusing series are similar soils in related families. Holderton soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section. Maplehill soils have a buried dark colored A horizon within a depth of 36 inches. Raynham soils occur outside the flood plain in older lacustrine deposits. Raypol and Wyalusing soils are coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal. The Wakeland soils have an AC profile lacking a developed subsoil, are more acid in the substratum, and occur in areas of higher air temperatures. Wayland soils are fine-silty in the particle-size control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wakeville soils are level and nearly level soils on flood plains along low gradient streams. Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent. The soils formed in recent alluvium derived from upland glacial drift predominantly of shale, siltstone and sandstone origin with some limestone. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 30 to 45 inches; mean annual air temperature ranges from 46 to 50 degrees F.; and the growing season ranges from 110 to 150 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: Wakeville soils are the somewhat poorly drained member of a drainage sequence which includes the well drained Hamlin, moderately well drained Teel and poorly and very poorly drained Wayland soils. Allard, Howard and Valois soils are on gravelly, higher adjacent terraces. Langford, Erie, Chautauqua and Busti soils are till soils on higher surrounding landscapes. Swormsville soils occupy similar lowland positions but have a higher clay content in the subsoil."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Wakeville series is proposed for the somewhat poorly drained soils previously included with Teel series. The Teel series is now restricted to moderately well drained.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in the typical pedon are:\n1. Ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 7 inches (Ap horizon).\n2. Irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth and is greater than 0.2 percent within 1.25 meters.\n3. An aquic moisture regime - evidenced by low chroma matrix colors and redoximorphic features in the Bg horizons\n4. Particle-size control section from 10 to 40 inches that is coarse-silty weighted average.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
