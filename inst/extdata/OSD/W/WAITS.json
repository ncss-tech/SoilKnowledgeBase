  "OVERVIEW": "The Waits series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in calcareous glacial till with a mantle of volcanic ash and loess. These soils are on moraines and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 700 mm, and the mean annual temperature is about 6.7 degrees C.",
