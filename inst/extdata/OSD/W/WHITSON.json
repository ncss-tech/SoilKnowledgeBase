The concept of Whitson will remain the same except for the pH ranges to very strongly acid and carbonates are not within a depth of 60 inches.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nochric epipedon - the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 23 inches (0 to 58 cm) (Ap and Eg horizons);\nalbic horizon - the zone from 10 to 23 inches (25 to 58 cm)(Eg horizons);\nargillic horizon - the zone from approximately 23 to 52 inches (58 to 132 cm)(Btg horizons);\naquic conditions - redoximorphic features in all horizons below 10 inches (25 cm);\nRepresentative DMU is 503405.
