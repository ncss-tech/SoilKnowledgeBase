  "OVERVIEW": "The Weymouth series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils formed in calcareous, loamy and clayey alluvium and/or colluvium over dense, noncemented mudstone bedrock of Permian or Triassic age. These gently to strongly sloping soils occur on side slopes of hillslopes on dissected plains. Slope range from 1 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 584 mm (23 in), and mean annual air temperature is about 16.7 degrees C (62 degrees F).",

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:\nEdited 11/2015 (RFG-CJV): Series classification changed from Typic Haplustepts in order to recognize a calcic horizon. Almost all descriptions in published Soil Survey manuscripts are described like calcic horizons. Changed to tabular format. Added metric measurements. Updated horizon range in characteristics, competing series lists, geographically associated soil, and geographic setting.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle-size control section: 25 to 76 cm (10 to 30 in). (Parts of Bw horizon and Bk horizon)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 15 cm (0 to 6 in). (A horizon)\nCambic horizon: 15 to 46 cm (6 to 18 in). (Bw horizon)\nIdentifiable secondary carbonates: 15 to 76 cm (6 to 30 in). (Bw and Bk horizons)\nCalcic horizon: 46 to 76 cm (18 to 30 in). (Bk horizon)\nDensic contact: The contact with claystone or shale at 76 cm (30 in). (Cd horizon)\nUnderlying material - Most clods slake in water in less than 1 hour. This material can be dug with a light duty backhoe.\nADDITIONAL DATA: KSSL data 82TX207001 (Haskell Co., TX)\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
