  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils contain free carbonates within 10 inches of the surface.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR. 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1, 2, or 3.  It is silt loam, silty clay, or silty clay loam.  Reaction ranges from slightly acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4 or chroma of 0 with mottles of higher chroma or redder hue.\nThe 10 to 40 inch control section typically averages between 35 and 50 percent clay.  Individual substratum horizons below a depth of 40 inches typically contain from 35 to 60 percent clay but some pedons have very fine sandy loam and silt loam textures at these depths.  Strata less than 6 inches thick, thin lenses and small pockets of finer or coarser textures are common to most pedons and their horizontal bedding planes impart a weak primary coarse or very coarse platy structure to the C horizons.  The secondary, subangular blocky structure is thought to result from the high montmorillonitic clay content only and not a combination of all other soil forming processes. The C horizons are mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Waldron series is the only member of the family.  Other competing series are the Albaton, Blake, Blend, Colo, Dockery, Forney, Holly Spring, Leta, Luton, Myrick, Owego, Parkville, Solomon, Wabash, and Zook.  Albaton soils average between 50 and 60 percent clay in the control section and have vertic characteristics.  Blake soils are fine-silty.  Blend, Colo, Dockery, Forney, Leta, Luton, Owego, Parkville, Wabash, and Zook lack free carbonates within 20 inches of the surface.  Solomon soils have mollic epipedons and lack fine stratification immediately below an Ap horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

The Waldron soils formed in recent thick, stratified clayey and loamy sediments. The mean annual temperature ranges from 52 to 57 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 32 to 43 inches."
