Elevation ranges from 0 to 182 meters (sea level to 600 feet).  The soils formed in residuum from basic igneous rock with some influence from volcanic ash from local cinder cones.  The annual precipitation ranges from 305 to 508 millimeters (12 to 20 inches).  The mean annual temperature is about 24 degrees C. (75 degrees F.); average January temperature is 22 degrees C. (72 degrees F.); average July temperature is 25 degrees C. (78 degrees F.)"
