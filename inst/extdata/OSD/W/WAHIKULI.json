  "OVERVIEW": "The Wahikuli series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum weathered from basic igneous rock and volcanic ash.  Wahikuli soils are on low elevation, mountain hillslopes and have slopes of 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 305 to 508 millimeters (12 to 20 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 24 degrees C. (75 degrees F.)",

Elevation ranges from 0 to 182 meters (sea level to 600 feet).  The soils formed in residuum from basic igneous rock with some influence from volcanic ash from local cinder cones.  The annual precipitation ranges from 305 to 508 millimeters (12 to 20 inches).  The mean annual temperature is about 24 degrees C. (75 degrees F.); average January temperature is 22 degrees C.
