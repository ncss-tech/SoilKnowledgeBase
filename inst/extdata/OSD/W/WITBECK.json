    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 18 to 24 inches. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the pedon and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the surface horizons and from 0 to 35 percent in the B and C horizons.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 5 to 15 percent in the surface horizons and from 0 to 15 percent in the B and C horizons.  Stones and boulders range from 0 to 15 percent in the O, E, and B horizons and from 0 to 5 percent in the BC and C horizon.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 4: and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, mucky silt loam, or their cobbly analogs. Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR,10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam or the gravelly analogs of these textures.  Some pedons have Bw or BC horizons.\nThe C horizons have hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 1 to 4.  They are fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand loamy fine sand, loam, silt loam or the gravelly analogs of these textures.  Sandy substratum phases are recognized."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Nahma, Peacham Sago and Waucedah series in the same family.  Nahma soils are underlain by limestone bedrock within a depth of 40 inches.  Peacham soils have formed in dense basal till and have Cd horizons within 40 inches.  Sago soils have free carbonates within 40 inches.  Waucedah soils do not have coarse fragments in the soil and formed in alluvial deposits."

These soils formed in loamy glacial till.  Mean annual temperature is estimated to range from 41 to 43 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation ranges from 31 to 36 inches."
