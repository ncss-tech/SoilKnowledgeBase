  "OVERVIEW": "The Witbeck series consists of very deep, poorly drained soils formed in loamy deposits on ground moraines and end moraines.  Permeability is moderate or moderately slow.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the pedon and from strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 10 percent in the surface horizons and from 0 to 35 percent in the B and C horizons.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 5 to 15 percent in the surface horizons and from 0 to 15 percent in the B and C horizons.  Stones and boulders range from 0 to 15 percent in the O, E, and B horizons and from 0 to 5 percent in the BC and C horizon.\nThe O horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or is neutral; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 0 to 2.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 2 to 4: and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam, mucky silt loam, or their cobbly analogs. Some pedons have an E horizon.\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR,10YR, 2.5Y, 5Y, or is neutral; value of 3 to 5; and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loam, silt loam or the gravelly analogs of these textures.

Peacham soils have formed in dense basal till and have Cd horizons within 40 inches.  Sago soils have free carbonates within 40 inches.  Waucedah soils do not have coarse fragments in the soil and formed in alluvial deposits."
