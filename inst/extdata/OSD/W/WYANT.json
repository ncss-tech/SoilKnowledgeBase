Clay content in the argillic horizon is 27 to 35 percent by field texture and is more than 60 percent by multiplying 2,5 times the 15-bar water.  Depth to weathered tuff or tuff breccia is 20 to 40 inches. Base saturation by the sum of cations is less than 75 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.
