These soils are usually moist but are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  They are very strongly acid to strongly acid throughout. Clay content in the argillic horizon is 27 to 35 percent by field texture and is more than 60 percent by multiplying 2,5 times the 15-bar water.  Depth to weathered tuff or tuff breccia is 20 to 40 inches. Base saturation by the sum of cations is less than 75 percent throughout the profile.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.

These soils formed in residuum and colluvium from highly weathered tuff and tuff breccia.  The climate is marine with an average annual precipitation of 60 to 70 inches, occurring mostly as snowfall and rainfall during winter, with cool dry summers.  Average January temperature is about 30 degrees F.; average July temperature is about 63 degrees F., and average annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.  The growing season (28 degrees F.) is 150 to 200 days."
