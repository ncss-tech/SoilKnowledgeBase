The depth to soil horizons with more than 15 percent sand is 56 to 102 cm (22 to 40 inches). The depth to carbonates is 91 to 152 cm (36 to 60 inches). Rock fragments are primarily igneous (rhyolite, andesite, feldspar) and sedimentary (dolomite). Content ranges from none to a few pebbles in the upper two parts of the series control section and 1 to 15 percent in the lower two parts.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist (3 to 5 dry), and chroma of 1 to 3. It is silt loam. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to neutral.\nThe E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 5, and chroma of 2 or 3. It is silt loam. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 or 4. Texture is silty clay loam, but in some places it is silt loam. The Bt horizon averages 24 to 35 percent clay and less than 10 percent sand. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2Bt or 2BC horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is clay loam or loam. The clay content ranges from 20 to 34 percent, and sand content ranges from 22 to 45 percent. Reaction is moderately acid to slightly alkaline. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 0 to 20 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. It is loam, sandy loam, or fine sandy loam. The 2C horizon averages 15 to 20 percent clay and 35 to 55 percent sand. Reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Many pedons have secondary carbonate accumulations in the upper part. The calcium carbonate equivalent is 15 to 40 percent."

Downsouth, Hedrick, Kaneville, Newvienna, and Vasa soils are deeper than 102 cm (40 inches) to horizons with more than 15 percent sand. Juda soils have more than 20 percent clay in the lower part of the series control section. Richview soils do not have carbonates within a depth of 152 cm (60 inches).

The well drained Caprell soils developed in a thinner mantle of loess or other silty material and are on slightly higher landform positions. The moderately well drained Geryune soils have a mollic epipedon, and the well drained Piscasaw soils have a lighter colored surface layer. These soils are on similar landform positions nearby and form a biosequence with the Windere soils. The poorly drained Pella soils have a mollic epipedon and are in slight depressions and drainageways. The somewhat poorly drained Torox soils are on slightly lower landform positions."

An intermittent apparent seasonal high water table is at a depth of 61 to 107 cm below the surface (2.0 to 3.5 feet) at some time between February and April in most years. The potential for surface runoff is low or medium. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high or high (4.23 to 14.11 micrometers per second). Permeability is moderate."

Through MLRA update activities these units were found to have a bulk density of 1.45 to 1.70 g/cm3 in the lower part of the series control section, whereas the Wingate series has a bulk density of 1.70 to 1.90 g/cm3.\nDiagnostic horizons in this pedon are: ochric epipedon - the zone from the surface to a depth of 23 cm (9 inches) (Ap horizon); argillic horizon - the zone from 23 to 127 cm (9 to 50 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, 2Bt4, and 2Bt5 horizons); discontinuity at a depth of 79 cm (31 inches) - the contact between the Bt3 and 2Bt4 horizons; udic moisture regime.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
