The mean annual soil temperature is 44 to 47 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 20 to 40 inches. The solum contains 50 to 80 percent volcanic glass and glass-coated aggregates.  Phosphate retention is 40 to 70 percent.  The acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate extractable iron is 0.40 to 1.0 percent.  The 15-bar water content on dried and undried samples is 5 to 12 percent.  Field estimated clay content is 5 to 15 percent.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Base saturation is 80 to 100 percent by ammonium acetate.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 0 to 30 percent gravel. It has a fine earth texture of ashy sandy loam, ashy loamy sand, ashy loamy coarse sand or ashy sand.  It is neutral or slightly acid..\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy sandy loam, ashy fine sandy loam or cobbly ashy sandy loam.  It contains 0 to 10 percent durinodes and 0 to 25 percent concretions that are very friable when moist.  It contains 0 to 15 percent gravel and 0 to 30 percent cobbles.  Total coarse fragments range from 0 to 30 percent.\nThe 2Crqt horizon, when present, contains silica and clay coatings.  It may have a discontinuous silica cap at the upper boundary."
