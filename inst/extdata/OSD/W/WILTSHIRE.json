Rock fragments of mixed igneous and metamorphic rocks such as phyllite, schist, calcareous schist and phyllite, marble and greenstone range from 0 to 25 percent in the horizons above the fragipan, and from 25 to 80 percent in the C horizons. Reaction ranges from strongly acid too neutral.\nThe Ap horizon, has hue of 7.5YR or I0YR, value of 3 or 4, chroma of 2 through 4. Texture is silt loam, loam, clay loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe BE horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value 4 through 6, chroma 4 through 8. Texture is silt loam, or loam in the fine earth fraction. .\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value 4 through 6, chroma 4 through 6.

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: Wiltshire is the only series in this family.  The Clarksburg, Comly, Gatton, Homewood, Hustontown, Jonca, Readington, and Wooster soils are in the similar families. Clarsksburg soils are superactive and have rock fragments dominantly from sandstone, chert and limestone. Homewood soils are superactive and have sub-rounded shale, sandstone and limestone fragments. Comly soils are active and have rock fragments dominantly from granitic gneiss, shale and sandstone. Hustontown soils are active and have rock fragments of shale, siltstone and sandstone. Jonca soils are active and lack rock fragments of metamorphic rocks.  Readington soils are active and have 5YR and redder hues in the Bt horizon.  Gatton and Wooster soils have not been assigned a CEC class. ."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wiltshire soils are on nearly level to slightly concave upland flats, footslopes and edges of drainage swales.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent. The soils developed in colluvial materials of micaceous schist, phyllite, and greenstone schist over residual material weathered from low-grade marble. The climate is temperate and humid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 50 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 57 degrees F. The growing season ranges from 140 to 200 days."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Baltimore, Benevola, Chester, Conestoga, Funkstown, Glenelg, Hollinger, Hyattstown, Linganore, and Manor soils. Chester, Glenelg, and Manor soils are in residuum from mica schists and have less than 35 percent base saturation. Conestoga and Hollinger soils formed in residuum weathered from micaeous limestone and calcareous schist. Hagerstown soils have more than 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon.  Hyattstown and Linganore soils have bedrock within 40 inches and occupy higher landscape positions. Benevola occupies similar landscape positions, lacks a fragipan, and is formed from marble residuum."
