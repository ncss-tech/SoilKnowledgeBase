  "STATES": "WA",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wannacott series consists of moderately deep to dense glacial till, well drained soils formed in intermixed glaciolacustrine sediments and glacial till with a component of loess in the upper part.  These soils are on glaciolacustrine influenced moraines.  Slope ranges from 0 to 15 percent.  The mean annual air temperature is about 48 degrees F, and the average annual precipitation is about 13 inches.",

These soils are usually moist but are dry in all parts between depths of 4 to 12 inches for 90 to 105 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 14 inches thick.  Depth to the Btk horizon ranges from 12 to 25 inches.  The particle-size control averages 18 to 35 percent clay and is less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser material.  Depth to densic material is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is 0 to 10 percent coarse fragments.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe BA horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist or dry.  It is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Reaction is neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist or dry.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  Reaction ranges from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline.  There are few to common thin to moderately thick clay films.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam and is 0 to 10 percent pebbles.  There are common, thin to moderately thick clay films on faces of peds.  Reaction is mildly alkaline to strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is 8 to 18 percent clay and 15 to 35 percent pebbles in the upper part and 15 to 50 percent in the lower part.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline."

McKay soils are dry for 60 to 90 consecutive days and are more than 18 percent clay below Bt horizon.  McKay soils lack dense glacial till in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Morrow soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Nephi soils have 5YR hue in the Bt horizon.  Parleys soils have a calcic horizon and a Bt horizon which is neutral or slightly acid."
