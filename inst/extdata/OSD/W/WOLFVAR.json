    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 14 inches thick.  Depth to strongly contrasting material\nranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 10 to 18 inches.  The upper part of the partical-size control sections averages 20 to 35 percent clay.  The lower part has  35 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  Coarse fragments are less than 15 percent gravel.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 2 through 4 dry.  Texture is heavy clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline.\nThe Btk horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6  dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4.  Texture is clay loam or clay with 35 to 50 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 15 percent gravel.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 8 to 20 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 7.5YR, 10YR, or 2.5Y; value of 6 through 8 dry, 5 through 8 moist; and chroma of 2 through 4.  Matrix texture is clay loam, sandy loam, loam, or silt loam with 18 to 35 percent clay.  Coarse fragments range from 0 to 35 percent gravel.  Calcium carbonate equivalence ranges from 15 to 35 percent.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline.\nThe 2C or 2Bk horizon has hue the color of various sand grains. Texture is very or extremely gravelly sand, loamy sand, or coarse sand. Coarse fragments range from 35 to 70 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Calcium carbonate content decreases with depth."
