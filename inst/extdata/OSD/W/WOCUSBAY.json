  "OVERVIEW": "The Wocusbay series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed material derived from water tolerant herbaceous plants over diatomaceous earth and dacitic pumice in the lower part. The Wocusbay soils are on alluvial fans, basins, and depressions in valleys. Slopes range from 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 39 degrees F.",
