  "OVERVIEW": "The Wedlar series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from granitic rocks or welded tuff.  Wedlar soils are on fan remnants, ballenas, and inter-plateau basins.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 230 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

Cleghorn soils have horizons which are firm and brittle when moist.  Igert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Nevador soils do not have albic horizons, have argillic horizons with bases at 30 to 60 cm, and do not have gravelly horizons below the argillic horizon.  Wedertz and Zevadez soils have horizons which are firm and brittle when moist."
