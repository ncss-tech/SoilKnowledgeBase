In addition:  Aladshi and Allor soils have 15 to 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Alley  and Qwynn soils average more than 15 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Chime soils are moderately deep to paralithic contacts.  Cleghorn soils have horizons which are firm and brittle when moist.  Igert soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Nevador soils do not have albic horizons, have argillic horizons with bases at 30 to 60 cm, and do not have gravelly horizons below the argillic horizon.  Wedertz and Zevadez soils have horizons which are firm and brittle when moist."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wedlar soils are on fan remnants, ballenas, and inter-plateau basins.  These soils formed in alluvium derived mainly from granitic rocks or welded rhyolitic tuff.  Slopes are 2 to 15 percent.  Elevations range from 1,524 to 2,195 meters.  The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 250 mm, mean annual temperature is 8 to 12 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 100 to 130 days."
