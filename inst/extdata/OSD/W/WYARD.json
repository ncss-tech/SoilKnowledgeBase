  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyard series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained, moderately permeable soils formed in local alluvium from glacial till.  These soils are in swales and depressions on glacial till plains and have slopes ranging from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual temperature is 39 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation is 18 inches.",

It typically is loam or silt loam, but some is clay loam in the lower part. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. Where the chroma is less than 2, redoximorphic concentrations are few.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, silt loam or clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. It contains 10 to over 20 percent calcium carbonate.

Flom soils average more than 27 percent clay in the upper 30 inches of the series control section.  Larry, Mahtowa and Mann soils do not have Bk horizons."

Typically, Wyard soils are in a toposequence with Emrick, Fram, Heimdal and Tonka soils.  Emrick and Heimdal soils are on the higher parts of the landscape and Wyard soils are in shallow concave swales lying between the Heimdal, Emrick, Tonka and Fram soils.  Emrick, Fram and Heimdal soils are coarse-loamy.  Tonka soils are fine textured.  In association with Barnes and Svea soils, Wyard soils are in the swales and in complex with Hamlet soils at elevations slightly higher than Tonka soils.  Barnes, Hamlet and Svea soils do not have an aquic moisture regime.  Hamerly soils are in similar positions as Wyard and have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface."

The duration of ponding is typically brief. The soil has endosaturation with a seasonal high water table typically at depths of 1.5 to 2.5 feet at some time during the period of April through June."
