  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to carbonates typically is 26 to 36 inches but ranges from 20 to 48 inches.  The upper two-thirds of the series control section averages 18 to 27 percent clay.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 24 inches in thickness.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5, 2 or 3 moist, and chroma of 1. It is loam or silt loam. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. The A horizon, below a depth of 10 inches, typically has faint or distinct mottles with chroma of 3 to 6 and few to many patches of clean silt and sand grains on the faces of peds.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, 2 to 4 moist, and chroma of 1 to 4. It typically is loam or silt loam, but some is clay loam in the lower part. It is neutral or slightly alkaline. Where the chroma is less than 2, redoximorphic concentrations are few.\nThe Bk horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 8, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 3 or 4. It is loam, silt loam or clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. It contains 10 to over 20 percent calcium carbonate. Some pedons have a BC or BCK horizon.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 5 to 7, 4 to 6 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4. It typically is loam, but some is sandy loam or clay loam. It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline. Some pedons contain small pockets of silt, silt loam, fine sand, and a few stones in the C horizon."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bluffton, Flom, Larry, Mahtowa and Mann series as previously classified.  These soils are poorly or very poorly drained.  Bluffton soils are more moist in the soil moisture control section during the 120 days following he summer solstice.  Flom soils average more than 27 percent clay in the upper 30 inches of the series control section.  Larry, Mahtowa and Mann soils do not have Bk horizons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wyard soils are in level and nearly level, concave shallow swales and depressions on glacial till plains.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  The soils formed in local alluvium from glacial till and reworked till.  The mean annual temperature ranges from 37 to 45 degrees F, and the mean annual precipitation from 15 to 20 inches, most of which falls in the spring and summer."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Barnes, Emrick, Fram, Hamerly, Hamlet, Heimdal, Svea and Tonka soils.  Typically, Wyard soils are in a toposequence with Emrick, Fram, Heimdal and Tonka soils.  Emrick and Heimdal soils are on the higher parts of the landscape and Wyard soils are in shallow concave swales lying between the Heimdal, Emrick, Tonka and Fram soils.  Emrick, Fram and Heimdal soils are coarse-loamy.  Tonka soils are fine textured.  In association with Barnes and Svea soils, Wyard soils are in the swales and in complex with Hamlet soils at elevations slightly higher than Tonka soils.  Barnes, Hamlet and Svea soils do not have an aquic moisture regime.  Hamerly soils are in similar positions as Wyard and have a calcic horizon within 16 inches of the surface."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY: Somewhat poorly drained. Runoff is slow. Permeability is moderate. Water runs onto these soils from higher land during heavy rains or rapid melting of snow. The duration of ponding is typically brief. The soil has endosaturation with a seasonal high water table typically at depths of 1.5 to 2.5 feet at some time during the period of April through June."
