  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon ranges from 7 to 16 inches in thickness.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section typically is fine sandy loam or sandy loam, but loamy fine sand, fine sand, loam, very fine sand or loamy very fine sand are below depths of 25 inches in some pedons.  Some pedons have an EC up to 12 mmhos/cm.\nThe A horizon has 10YR hue, value of 2 or 3 and 3 to 5 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It typically is fine sandy loam, but some is sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, silt loam or loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.  Some pedons have an Ak horizon.\nThe Bk horizon has 2.5Y or 10YR hue, value of 3 to 6 and 4 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam and has a calcium carbonate equivalent of 15 to 30 percent.  It is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  In some pedons it has a few fine faint redoximorphic features.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 4 to 7 and 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Chroma of 6 is allowed below depths of 35 inches.  The C horizon has textures ranging from silt loam to fine sand.   Where present, the coarser textures are below depths of 25 inches.  The C horizon is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  Redoximorphic features range from few to many and from faint to prominent.  Materials below a depth of 40 inches in some pedons range from fine to coarse textured."

Cookcan soils occur at elevations above 4,900 feet, have a water table at less than 1.5 feet and are on floodplains.  Cowbone soils occur at elevations above 3,600 feet, do not have carbonates below the calcic horizon, have a water table at less than 1.5 feet and are on floodplains.  Fram soils contain 1 to 10 percent rock fragments throughout and formed in loam till."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",

They formed in calcareous moderately coarse and coarse glaciofluvial and glaciolacustrine deposits.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 36 to 45 degrees F, and mean annual precipitation from 14 to 23 inches."

Arveson soils have prominent mottling within a depth of 20 inches and are poorly drained.  Tiffany soils do not have a calcic horizon within depths of 16 inches.  Egeland soils are well drained and are on higher lying convex areas.  Embden soils have mollic epipedons more than 16 inches thick and are on slightly higher, better drained positions.  Hecla and Maddock soils are on nearby higher lying areas.  Ulen soils are in similar positions as the Wyndmere soils.  Hecla, Maddock and Ulen soils are sandy."
