  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.   The concentration of soft powdery lime is most evident below depth of 48 inches but some lime veins and flecks occur at depths of 36 to 48 inches.  Rock fragments range from 20 to 35 percent in the A and upper B2t horizon and increase to 40 percent in the lower part of the B2t and to 75 percent in the Cca horizon.  The mean annual soil temperature is 43 to 45 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature is about 63 degrees F.  The soils are usually moist but are dry for more than 60 consecutive days in all parts of the 4- to 12-inch depth in more than 7 out of 10 years.\nThe A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5 dry, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is neutral or slightly acid.\nThe B2t horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 3 or 4.  It has strong medium or coarse angular blocky structure and is neutral or slightly acid.  Manganese concretions are common in the upper part of the B2t horizon.  The upper 20 inches of the horizon contain more than 60 percent clay.  The texture change from A to B2t is more than 20 percent increase in clay within a vertical distance of 3 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Deer Creek, Dry Creek and Yeates Hollow series.  Deer Creek soils have clay B2t horizons containing 35 to 60 percent clay overlying strong lime horizons at depths of about 30 to 36 inches.  Dry Creek and Yeates Hollow soils have cobbly argillic horizons containing more than 35 percent rock fragments and 35 to 60 percent clay.  Also, Yeates Hollow soils lack horizons of lime accumulation within depth of 60 inches."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Whipstock soils occur on sloping alluvial fans and very steep mountain slopes having gradients of 5 to 60 percent.  They formed in alluvium and residuum derived from sedimentary parent rocks mainly argillaceous shale, sandstone and some quartzite.  Elevations are 5,600 to 6,800 feet.  The climate is moist subhumid with an average annual precipitation of 18 to 25 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 70 to 90 days."
