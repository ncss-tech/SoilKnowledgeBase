These soils formed in alluvium derived from mixed rocks, with a loess mantle high in volcanic ash.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Elevations are 1,220 to 1,710 meters.  The climate is cool, arid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 150 to 200 mm, mean annual temperature is 7 to 10 degrees C, and the frost-free season is 100 to 120 days."
