  "OVERVIEW": "The Wailuku series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium weathered from basic igneous rocks.  Wailuku soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 3 to 15 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 762 millimeters (30 inches), and mean annual air temperature is about 23 degrees C. (73 degrees F.)",
