  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of soil development ranges from 50 to more than 80 inches.  Thickness of the recent alluvium is 20 to 36 inches.  The recent alluvial material ranges from neutral to slightly acid and the older buried alluvial material ranges from moderately acid to very strongly acid.  The particle-size control section averages 25 to 42 percent clay and 5 to 12 percent sand.\nThe upper part of the control section (Ap horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 3 or 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe second part of the control section (Bw horizon) has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe third part of the control section (2Bwb horizon) have hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6, and commonly has redox features.  It is commonly silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe lower part of the control section (2Btb, 2BC, and 2C where present) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 to 6, and has redox features.  It is commonly silty clay, silty clay loam, or clay loam and includes thin strata of loam and sandy loam."

Woodmere soils formed in 20 to 36 inches of recent alluvium and the underlying older alluvial materials.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 46 inches and the mean annual temperature is 52 to 57 degrees F."

The well drained Millstone and Wheeling, moderately well drained Sciotoville, somewhat poorly drained Hatfield and Weinbach, and poorly drained Ginat soils are on stream terraces.  The well drained Huntington, Nolin, McAdoo, the moderately well drained Lindside, and the somewhat poorly drained Newark soils are on adjacent and lower lying flood plains and flood-plain steps."

An apparent intermittent high water table is at 2.5 feet to 3.5 feet from December through April in most years.  This soil is subject to rare to frequent periods of flooding."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The particle-size class is not clearly known.  Characterization data is very limited, and data from a pedon in Perry Co., IN places this series in the fine-silty rather than fine class.  As more data is collected, the classification of this series could change.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:  1) Ochric epipedon:  the zone from 0 to 10 inches (Ap horizon); 2) Cambic horizon:  the zone from 10 to 30 inches (Bw horizon); 3) Buried soil horizons:  the zone from 30 to 80 inches (2Bwb, 2Btb1, 2Btb2; 4) Redoximorphic features:  the zone from 30 to 80 inches.\nADDITIONAL DATA:  Lab data available for this series is on file at the Agricultural Experiment Station, Purdue University, Station Bulletin No.  175, File No. WA7401; and pedon number S94IN-123-010 at the National Soil Survey Center, Lincoln, NE.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
