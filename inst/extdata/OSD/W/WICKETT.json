These soils formed in a sandy and loamy eolian mantle that overlies thick beds of caliche.   Climate is arid to semiarid. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 16 inches and mean annual temperature ranges from 62 to 68 degrees F.   Frost-free days range from 210 to 240 and elevation ranges from 2,300 to 3,500 feet.  Thornthwaite P-E indices are less than 25."

Douro and Sharvana soils are in similar positions.  Blakeney and Conger soils do not have Bt horizons and have petrocalcic horizons within 20 inches of the surface.  They are in adjacent landscapes.  Faskin and Palomas soils have more than 18 percent clay in the Bt horizons and do not have petrocalcic horizons within 40 inches of the surface and occur in similar positions. Maljamar and Pyote soils have sandy surface horizons more than 20 inches thick and have petrocalcic horizons greater than 40 inches deep and are in similar positions.  Penwell soils are sandy throughout and do not have Bt horizons. Triomas soils do not have petrocalcic horizons and are in similar positions."

Family placement change from mixed to siliceous mineralogy is based on the same laboratory data.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Lincoln Laboratory data (S85TX-003-003)\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
