  "STATES": "TX",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wickett series consists of soils that are moderately deep to a petrocalcic horizon.  They are well drained soils that are moderately rapidly permeable above and below a very slowly permeable petrocalcic horizon.  These soils formed in sandy and loamy eolian materials over thick beds of calcium carbonate.  These soils are on nearly level to very gently sloping uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.",

Douro and Sharvana soils are in similar positions.  Blakeney and Conger soils do not have Bt horizons and have petrocalcic horizons within 20 inches of the surface.  They are in adjacent landscapes.  Faskin and Palomas soils have more than 18 percent clay in the Bt horizons and do not have petrocalcic horizons within 40 inches of the surface and occur in similar positions. Maljamar and Pyote soils have sandy surface horizons more than 20 inches thick and have petrocalcic horizons greater than 40 inches deep and are in similar positions.  Penwell soils are sandy throughout and do not have Bt horizons. Triomas soils do not have petrocalcic horizons and are in similar positions."
