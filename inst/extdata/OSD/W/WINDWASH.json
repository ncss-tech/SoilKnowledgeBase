  "OVERVIEW": "The Windwash series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite. Windwash soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2 degrees C.",
