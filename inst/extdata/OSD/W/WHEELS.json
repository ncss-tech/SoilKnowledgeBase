  "OVERVIEW": "The Wheels series consists of very shallow and shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum from sandstone.  Wheels soils are on ridges and buttes.  Slopes range from 15 to 90 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 59 degrees F.",
