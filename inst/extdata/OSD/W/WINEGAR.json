  "OVERVIEW": "The Winegar series consists of moderately well drained soils on ground moraines.  Slopes are 4 to 15 percent.  These soils formed in glacial till derived from mixed volcanic bedrock.  They are influenced by loess and volcanic ash. Winegar soils are moderately deep to dense basal till.  Permeability is moderately slow.  Mean annual precipitation is about 890 mm and mean annual air temperature is about 3 degrees C.",
