    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winegar soils are on undulating to rolling ground moraines.  Slopes range from 4 to 15 percent.  The soil formed in glacial till derived from mixed volcanic rock.  There is some loess and volcanic ash influence in the upper part.  Surface and subsoil layers of these soils are lightly reworked by colluvial or alluvial action.  Substratums are dense basal till.  Elevations range from 6200 to 9900 feet.  Average annual precipitation is 30 to 45 inches being well-distributed throughout the year.  Average annual temperature is 32 to 39 degrees F. The frost free period is 5 to 70 days."
