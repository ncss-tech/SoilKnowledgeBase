The mean annual soil temperature is 49 to 56 degrees F. The solum ranges from 26 to more than 60 inches thick. The particle-size control section is 5 to 15 percent clay,0 to 10 percent gravel, and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand. Depth to bedrock is more than 60 inches. Depth to secondary calcium carbonate is 43 inches or more.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, or silt loam. Organic matter content is 1 to 4 percent. Reaction is neutral to slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 5 moist, 4 to 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry. Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or loam with 5 to 15 percent clay and 0 to 10 percent gravel. This horizon has weak medium to coarse prismatic or weak fine to medium subangular blocky structure. Organic matter content is less than 1 percent. Reaction is slightly alkaline to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon, when present, has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 moist, 4 to 8 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry. Texture is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam or gravelly sandy loam with 10 to 15 percent clay and 0 to 25 percent gravel.\nThe 2Ck horizon, when present, is weakly cemented very gravelly loamy sand or very gravelly sand with 2 to 10 percent clay. It has 1 to 5 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."
