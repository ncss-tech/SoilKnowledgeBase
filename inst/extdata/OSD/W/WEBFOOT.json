    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 42 to 47 degrees F, and the mean summer temperature is greater than 55 degrees F.  The soil is saturated from March through June at a depth of 1.0 to 2.0 feet; it is dry in all parts of the moisture control section from mid-July through mid-September.  The mollic epipedon and depth to the 2Cg horizon is 20 to 40 inches.  The particle-size control section averages 5 to 15 percent clay and 35 to 60 percent coarse fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has 0 to 15 percent gravel, and some pedons may have up to 15 percent (2-4 mm) concretions.  The lower part of this horizon has few to common distinct mottles.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.  It has 4 to 10 percent organic matter.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry.  It is gravelly sandy loam or gravelly loam with 10 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  It has few to many distinct or prominent mottles.  It is slightly or moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Cg horizon has hue of 5Y or 2.5Y and is usually gleyed. It has value of 4 or 5 moist, 6 or 7 dry and chroma of 0 to 2 moist and dry.  It is extremely gravelly loamy sand, extremely gravelly sand or very gravelly sandy loam with 30\nto 60 percent gravel and 10 to 20 percent cobbles.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline."

All of these soils lack the saturated layer above 40 inches for 90 or more consecutive days.  Burgi, Climine, and St. Anthony soils have 18 to 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Baldridge soils have a cambic horizon and formed in colluvium derived from rhyolite and andesite.  Chambeam soils have a cambic horizon and the coarse fragments are channery.  Fredonyer, Ginser, Sinker and Westbutte soils are 20 to 40 inches to bedrock.\nGlean soils have 1 to 3 percent organic matter in the mollic epipedon.  Lambring soils have 2 to 3 percent organic matter in the mollic epipedon. Smidale soils have a mollic epipedon more than 50 inches thick and have 16 to 30 percent clay in the particle-size control section. Willynat soils have a mollic epipedon 40 to 60 inches thick."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Webfoot soils occur on low terraces. Slopes are 0 to 7 percent.  Elevations range from 3,800 to 4,200 feet.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium from mixed rock types with an influence of loess and volcanic ash in\nthe surface horizon.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 24 inches.  The mean annual air temperature is 40 to 45 degrees F.  The frost-free period is 50 to 90 days.  This soil is on the Winkle geomorphic surface."

McEwen soils are on adjacent higher terraces, are well drained, have an argillic horizon and are fine-loamy.  Stovepipe and Sumpley soils are on adjacent flood plains.  Stovepipe soils are poorly drained, coarse-silty over sandy or sandy-skeletal and are cryic. Sumpley soils are fine-loamy over sandy or sandy-skeletal."
