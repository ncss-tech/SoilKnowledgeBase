  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitehills series consists of moderately deep, well drained\nsoils that formed in alluvium from basic igneous rock.  Whitehills soils are on fan terraces and have slopes of 1 to 15 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
