    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wagstaff soils are on nearly level to gently sloping summits, shoulder and side slopes on interfluves on plains in the Cherokee Prairies.  The slopes are usually linear to convex.  Slope gradients range from about 0 to 8 percent. Wagstaff soils formed in a thin mantle of loess and the underlying residuum from limestone of Pennsylvanian age.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 880 to 1095 mm (35 to 43 inches) and is distributed throughout the year with May through July receiving the most precipitation usually during intense thunderstorms.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 13 to 16 degrees C (55 to 62 degrees F)."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Formerly these soils were mapped as Catoosa and Oska series.\nWAW 8/2009 The classification and type location for Wagstaff are being revised as part of an update project in MLRA 112.  The original type location was established as a result of a small project in the northern extreme of MLRA 112 and this location is more central to MLRA 112.  The original concept was slightly better drained with smectitic mineralogy.  Further investigation and data throughout the MLRA suggests this new classification is the most prevalent.  The mean annual soil temperature at the type location and in the northern range of the series is slightly less than the 15 degree C break for thermic soils.  The MLRA 112 boundary crosses the mesic thermic areas and for classification MLRA 112 soils are considered thermic.\nDiagnostic features and horizons recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: 0 to 54 cm (0 to 21 in.)\nArgillic horizon: 39 to 93 cm (15 to 37 in.)\nRedox concentrations: 54 to 93 cm (21 to 37 in.)\nSlickensides: 54 to 93 cm (21 to 37 in.)\nLinear extensibility greater than 6.0 cm within 100 cm.\nLithic contact: 93 cm (37 in.)\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nTypical NSSL laboratory sample pedon 86P0874 (pedon 86KS001007) is from the type location.  Other lab samples that support this series are: National Soil Survey Laboratory, Lincoln, Nebraska - 05N0817, 86P0871, 08N0034, 96P0385 and Missouri Characterization Laboratory Number M0501304.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
