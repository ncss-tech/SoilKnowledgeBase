  "OVERVIEW": "The Wickahoney series consists of shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  These soils are on foothills and tablelands.  Slopes are 1 to 45 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 380 mm, and the average annual temperature is about 6 degrees C.",
