  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wickahoney soils occur on the convex summits and sideslopes of rolling foothills and on summits of tablelands.  Elevations are 1,495 to 2,245 meters.  Slopes are 1 to 45 percent.  These soils formed in residuum derived from extrusive rocks and volcanic ash.  The climate is cool and moist in winter and warm and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation is 330 to 460 mm, and average annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C.  The frost-free period is 60 to 95 days."
