  "OVERVIEW": "The Wanser series consists of deep, poorly drained soils formed in sand from mixed sources.  Wanser soils are on flood plains or in depressional area.  Slopes are 0 to 12 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual temperature is about 51 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 51 to 54 degrees F.  These soils are always moist and the water table is within a few inches of the surface at some period of the year or the soils are artificially drained.  Reaction ranges from moderately alkaline to strongly alkaline and same subhorizon is strongly alkaline within a depth of 40 inches. Effervescence is none to violent in any one horizon.  The particle-size control section ranges from sand to loamy fine sand.\nThe A horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.\nThe Cg horizon has value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 to 7 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry and is mottled in most pedons.  It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or sand."

Carrolls soils are slightly acid or neutral throughout and average 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass in the particle-size control section.  Conrad and Tryon soils are neutral or mildly alkaline.  Forbar soils have a mean annual soil temperature that ranges from 48 to 51 degrees F.  Gothenburg soils have a 2C horizon at 3 to 20 inches that is 10 to 35 percent gravel.  Heceta soils are slightly acid or medium acid.  Hovde soils are slightly acid to mildly alkaline and have hue of 2.5Y, 5Y, or neutral in the C horizon.  Junius soils have neutral to medium acid A horizons and slightly acid to mildly alkaline B horizons.  Stafford soils have a slightly acid to extremely acid B horizon.  Tyre soils have bedrock at a depth of 20 to 40 inches and are neutral to strongly acid."
