    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Winginaw soils are in closed depressions on alluvial fans and stream terraces. Elevations are 4,000 to 5,000 feet. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. These soils formed in fibrous organic matter 16 to 51 inches thick over loamy calcareous alluvium. The climate is characterized by long, cold winters; cool, moist springs; and warm, dry summers. Mean annual precipitation is 14 to 19 inches. Mean annual temperature is 39 to 45 degrees F. The frost-free period is 85 to 110 days."
