  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Winginaw series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in organic materials which are about 27 inches thick over calcareous mineral materials. These soils are in closed depressions on alluvial fans and stream terraces. Slopes are 0 to 2 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches, and mean temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
