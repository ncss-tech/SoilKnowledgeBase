  "OVERVIEW": "The Warnut series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils. They are formed in loamy alluvium. These soils occur in interdunal depressions on paleo-terraces of the Great Bend Sand Plains (MLRA 79). Mean annual air temperature is 56 degrees F (13 degrees C), and mean annual precipitation is 29 inches (74 centimeters). Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.",

The well drained, sandy Pratt and Turon soils are on dunes. The well drained, fine-loamy Saltcreek soils are on dunes. Solvay soils are better drained and do not have a buried soil with 30 to 45 percent clay, and are on slightly higher positions."
