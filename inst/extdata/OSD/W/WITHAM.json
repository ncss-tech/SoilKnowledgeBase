The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 52 to 56 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches. Redoximorphic features including depletions occur at a depth of 10 to 30 inches. The soil cracks to the surface during the summer and early fall. The mollic epipedon is 10 to 25 inches thick. The pscs has 50 to 60 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent gravel.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist, 2 or 3 dry. Texture is silty clay loam or silty clay with 27 to 60 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent gravel. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BA or A2 horizon, when present, has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 or 4 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry. Texture is silty clay or clay with 40 to 60 percent clay and 0 to 5 percent gravel. Reaction is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 1 to 3 moist, 2 or 3 dry.

The mean annual precipitation is 40 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is 50 to 54 degrees F. The mean January temperature is 38 to 40 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 64 to 68 degrees F. The frost-free period is 165 to 210 days."

Dixonville soils are 20 to 40 inches to a paralithic contact and occur on linear to convex hillslopes. Gellatly soils do not have redoximorphic features and occur on linear to concave hillslopes. Philomath soils are 12 to 20 inches to a paralithic contact and are on convex hillslopes. Ritner soils are clayey-skeletal and are on convex hillslopes at higher elevations."
