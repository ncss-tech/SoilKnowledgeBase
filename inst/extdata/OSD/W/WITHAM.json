  "OVERVIEW": "The Witham series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in clayey slope alluvium and colluvium weathered primarily from basalt. Witham soils occur on fans and foot slopes and toe slopes of hills. Slopes are 2 to 20 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F.",
