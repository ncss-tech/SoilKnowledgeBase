  "OVERVIEW": "The Wauquie series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium derived from granite, sandstone, and shale.  Wauquie soils are on mesas, canyons, hills, benches, mountains, and alluvial fans.  Slopes range from 6 to 60 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 15 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 49 degrees F.",
