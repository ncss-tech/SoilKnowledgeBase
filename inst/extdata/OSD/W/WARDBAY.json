  "OVERVIEW": "The Wardbay series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Wardbay soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 75 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 460 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 4 degrees C.",
