  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wardbay soils are on mountains.  They typically occur on backslope positions. These soils formed in residuum and colluvium derived from limestone and dolomite.  Slopes are 8 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,890 to 3,160 meters. The climate is semiarid with cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm, the mean annual temperature is 2 to 6 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
