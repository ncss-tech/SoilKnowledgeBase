These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches or the paralithic contact if shallower.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle size control section averages more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser and has 0 to 25 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or gravelly silt loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 5 percent."

Bijorja soils are gravelly coarse sandy loam in the B horizon and are 20 to 40 inches to weathered granodiorite.  Prosser and Vining soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Irrigon soils are neutral and have a paralithic contact with tuffaceous sandstone."

The soils formed in poorly sorted eolian deposits overlying semi-consolidated Ringold deposits or Ellensburg formation.   These soils occur in an arid climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The average January temperature is 27 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 73 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost free season is 140 to 200 days."
