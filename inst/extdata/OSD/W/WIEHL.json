  "OVERVIEW": "The Wiehl series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in eolian deposits and glaciofluvial sediments over semiconsolidated siltstone, sandstone, and shale.  Wiehl soils occur on terraces and have slopes of 0 to 65 percent.  The annual precipitation is about 7 inches and the average annual\ntemperature is about 50 degrees F.",

These soils are usually dry in all parts between depths of 8 and 24 inches or the paralithic contact if shallower.  Depth to a paralithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The particle size control section averages more than 15 percent fine sand and coarser and has 0 to 25 percent rock fragments.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or silt loam.\nThe Bk horizon has value of 5 through 7 dry, 3 through 6 moist, and chroma of 2 through 4 dry or moist.  It is very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, silt loam, or gravelly silt loam.  Calcium carbonate equivalent is 1 to 5 percent."

Bijorja soils are gravelly coarse sandy loam in the B horizon and are 20 to 40 inches to weathered granodiorite.  Prosser and Vining soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Irrigon soils are neutral and have a paralithic contact with tuffaceous sandstone."

The soils formed in poorly sorted eolian deposits overlying semi-consolidated Ringold deposits or Ellensburg formation.   These soils occur in an arid climate with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  The annual precipitation is 6 to 9 inches.  The average January temperature is 27 degrees F.; the average July temperature is 73 degrees F.; and the average annual temperature is 50 to 53 degrees F.  The frost free season is 140 to 200 days."
