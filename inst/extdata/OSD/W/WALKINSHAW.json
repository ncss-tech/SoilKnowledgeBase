These soils are usually moist but are dry in the soil moisture control section 0 to 30 consecutive days during summer; udic moisture regime.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section from the mineral soil surface to the bedrock contact has andic soil properties with estimated moist bulk density of 0.50 to 0.90 g/cc, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 2 to 4 percent, phosphate retention of 85 to 100 percent, 15-bar water retention of 15 to 30 percent for air-dried samples, acid oxalate iron is 1.5 to 3.0 percent, and 60 to 90 percent rock fragments by volume.  It has 2 to 5 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.
