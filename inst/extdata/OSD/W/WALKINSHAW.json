  "OVERVIEW": "The Walkinshaw series consists of shallow to bedrock, well drained soils that formed in colluvium from marine basalt and associated volcanic rocks on mountain slopes.  Slopes are 60 to 100 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 110 inches and average annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

It has 2 to 5 cmol/kg of aluminum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 3, 4, or 6 dry.
