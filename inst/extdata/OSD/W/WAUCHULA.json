  "OVERVIEW": "The Wauchula series consists of very deep, very poorly or poorly drained, moderately slow or slowly permeable soils on flatwoods on the lower coastal plains.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 55 inches.  Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent.",

Basinger soils are on similar positions, have weakly expressed spodic horizons, and are sandy throughout.  EauGallie, Monteocha, Oldsmar, and Pomona soils have argillic horizons below a depth of 36 inches.  In addition, EauGallie soils are on similar positions, Monteocha soils are very poorly drained, are on similar to lower positions, and have an umbric epipedon, Oldsmar soils have spodic horizons 30 to 50 inches below the surface, and Pomona soils are on slightly higher positions.  Immokalee and Pomello soils have spodic horizons 30 to 50 inches below the surface and lack argillic horizons.  In addition, Immokalee soils are on similar positions and Pomello soils are somewhat poorly to moderately well drained and are on higher positions.  Myakka, Ona, and St. Johns soils do not have argillic horizons below the spodic horizon.  In addition, Myakka soils are on similar positions, the poorly drained Ona soils are on similar to higher positions and have spodic horizons immediately below the surface horizon, and St. Johns soils have an umbric epipedon.  The very poorly drained Placid and Pompano soils are on similar to lower positions and are sandy throughout.  In addition, Placid soils have an umbric epipedon."

It is at depths of about 10 to 40 inches for periods as long as about 6 months, but during the driest season it recedes to depths of more than 40 inches.  Depressional areas are covered with standing water for periods of 6 to 9 months or more in most years.\nCharacterization sample: Sampled as S54-22-(1-8) IFAS, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida."
