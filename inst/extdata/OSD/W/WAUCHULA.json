Vertical lenses or pockets of depletions in shades of gray and brown range from none to common.  Sand grains are coated with organic matter.  Texture is fine sand, sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.\nThe BW horizon, where present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 4.  Accumulations of organic matter in shades of red and brown range from few to common. Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe E' horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4.  Texture is fine sand or sand.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5GY, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 4 to 7.

Basinger soils are on similar positions, have weakly expressed spodic horizons, and are sandy throughout.  EauGallie, Monteocha, Oldsmar, and Pomona soils have argillic horizons below a depth of 36 inches.  In addition, EauGallie soils are on similar positions, Monteocha soils are very poorly drained, are on similar to lower positions, and have an umbric epipedon, Oldsmar soils have spodic horizons 30 to 50 inches below the surface, and Pomona soils are on slightly higher positions.  Immokalee and Pomello soils have spodic horizons 30 to 50 inches below the surface and lack argillic horizons.  In addition, Immokalee soils are on similar positions and Pomello soils are somewhat poorly to moderately well drained and are on higher positions.  Myakka, Ona, and St. Johns soils do not have argillic horizons below the spodic horizon.  In addition, Myakka soils are on similar positions, the poorly drained Ona soils are on similar to higher positions and have spodic horizons immediately below the surface horizon, and St. Johns soils have an umbric epipedon.  The very poorly drained Placid and Pompano soils are on similar to lower positions and are sandy throughout.  In addition, Placid soils have an umbric epipedon."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 12 inches (Ap, Eg).\nAlbic horizon - the zone from 6 to 12 inches (Eg).\nSpodic horizon - the zone from 12 to 22 inches (Bh1, Bh2).\nCambic horizon - the zone from 22 to 34 inches (BW).\nArgillic horizon - the zone from 34 to 44 inches (Btg).\nThe type location was moved to its present location since of the 6 sampled profiles, only one had Bt horizons below 37 inches and it was at a depth of 38 inches.\nWater table is at depths of 6 to 18 inches for 1 to 4 months during most years.  It is at depths of about 10 to 40 inches for periods as long as about 6 months, but during the driest season it recedes to depths of more than 40 inches.  Depressional areas are covered with standing water for periods of 6 to 9 months or more in most years.\nCharacterization sample: Sampled as S54-22-(1-8) IFAS, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
