  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Aquic conditions and redox features extend to the soil surface  The soils are usually moist and are dry less than 45 consecutive days in the four months that follow the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 35 to 40 degrees F., the mean summer soil temperature is 40 to 43 degrees F. and the mean winter soil temperature is 32 to 35 degrees F.  Gravel-size pumice fragments 2 to 4 centimeters in diameter average 35 to 85 percent in the particle-size control section.  The fine-earth fraction is vesicular ash predominantly coarse sand size.  Field estimated clay content is 0 to 5 percent.  The soil contains 70 to 100 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention of 25 to 60 percent, acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half the iron of 0.4 to 1.0 percent, 15 bar water content of 3 to 12 percent on dried samples and moist bulk density of 0.70 to 1.00 grams per cubic centimeter.  It is strongly acid to neutral throughout.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 to 6 moist and 5 to 8 dry and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry.  It has faint dark grayish brown redox features.  The fine earth fraction may include a significant amount of diatomaceous earth that may impart a light color and fine texture.  It is ashy loamy sand or diatomaceous silt.\nThe BC horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, value 4 to 6 moist and 6 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 6 moist and dry.  Redox features are faint or distinct dark grayish brown to reddish brown.  It has 35 to 90 percent gravel size pumice."

Deepdish soils contain spodic material, are somewhat poorly drained with depth to redox features and aquic conditions being 6 to 16 inches.  Kirk soils have a mollic epipedon and a medial loam surface layer that is 7 to 20 inches thick.."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wickiup soils are in depressions and swales on pumice-mantled stream terraces.  These soils formed in gravel-size pumice and ash.  The climate is characterized by cold, wet winters and cool, dry summers.  Elevation ranges from 4,000 to 5,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 18 to 36 inches, falling mostly as snow.  The mean annual temperature is 40 to 44 degrees F.  The frost free period is 0 to 50 days."
