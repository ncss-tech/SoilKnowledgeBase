  "OVERVIEW": "The Wequetequock series consists of very deep, subaqueous soils permanently submerged beneath 20 through 200 cm of tidal estuarine water in submerged stream valleys and mainland coves in bays. The Wequetequock soils are formed in loamy marine deposits over deep buried organic materials. Slope ranges from 0 through 2 percent, mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C., and mean annual precipitation is about 1295 mm.",

One or more horizons with a combined thickness of at least 15 cm within 50 cm of the mineral soil surface contain sulfidic materials. Soil has a 5:1 salinity greater than 0.6 dS/m throughout the profile. Buried organic soil materials occur below 100 cm from the mineral soil surface. Reaction is neutral through moderately alkaline and oxidized pH is ultra acid through slightly acid throughout.\nThe A horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR through 5Y, or is neutral, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 0 or 1. Texture is mucky silt loam through loam. It is massive. Organic matter is 5 through 15 percent. Consistence is very fluid.\nSome pedons have an AC horizon with similar characteristics to the A horizon. It is 0 through 25 cm thick.\nThe C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. Texture ranges from silt loam through sandy loam. It is massive. Gravel content is 0 through 10 percent. Consistence is nonfluid through very fluid.\nThe 2Ob horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 2 through 3, and chroma of 1 through 3. It is muck or mucky peat. It is massive. Consistence is very fluid.\nSome pedons have a 2C or 3C horizon with hue of 2.5Y or 5Y or is neutral, value of 4, and chroma of 0 through 3.

Pishagqua soils are in low energy lagoon bottom landscapes, do not have organic horizons, and are fine-silty particle-size class. The Fort Neck soils have an n-value of 0.7 or less in some horizon at a depth between 20 and 50 cm below the mineral soil surface. Billington soils have an organic horizon, 20 cm or more thick, within 100 cm of the soil surface."

Peraquic feature - positive soil water potential (permanently submerged) at the soil surface (under 1.3 m of water at the time of coring).\n2. Sulfidic materials - the zone from 40 to 105 cm (Cse1 and Cse2 horizons).\n3. Fluventic feature - irregular decrease in the content of organic carbon from a depth of 25 cm to a depth of 125 cm (ACse, Cse1, Cse2 and 2Oaseb horizons).\n4. High n-value - the zone from 0 to 150 cm has an n-value greater than 0.7, as surmised by the very fluid and moderately fluid manner of failure (Ase, ACse, Cse1, Cse2 and 2Oabse horizons).\n5. Buried soil feature - the zone from 105 to 150 cm (the 2Oaseb horizon). Radiocarbon dating measurements for the underlying marsh deposits are 2650 +/- 40 years BP measured and 2600 +/- 40 years BP conventional radiocarbon age.\n6.
