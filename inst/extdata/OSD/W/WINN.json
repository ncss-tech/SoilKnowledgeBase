Coit soils are poorly drained and receive 6 to 8 inches of mean annual precipitation.  Collister soils are moderately well drained and reaction is neutral or slightly acid.  Draper soils are not effervescent throughout.  Eastcan soils are moderately well drained with endosaturation commonly greater than 40 inches in depth.  Goose Creek soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Gosinta soils are moderately well drained and have very gravelly 2C horizons.  Heidtman soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Lakeview soils are not effervescent throughout, formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks, and are influenced by volcanic ash.  Oxy soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Shoepeg soils have gravelly 2C horizons at 40 inches or more.  Willowdale soils are well drained and are very gravelly or extremely gravelly below 40 inches."

    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 40 inches (A1, A2, and A3 horizons).\nEndosaturation feature - The condition of ground water with an upper boundary between 30 and 42 inches at certain times during normal years (parts of the A3 and C horizons).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from 10 to 40 inches (A2 and A3 horizons and part of the A1 horizon).\nThe superactive cation exchange activity class is estimated based on CEC-7 and clay data in NASIS.  In September 1998 the taxonomic classification was changed from an Endoaquoll because the 40 to 50 cm layer doesn't have an aquic condition.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
