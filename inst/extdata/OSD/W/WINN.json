  "OVERVIEW": "The Winn series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived mainly from limestone, sandstone, and quartzite.  Winn soils are on flood plains and low stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 3 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

Coit soils are poorly drained and receive 6 to 8 inches of mean annual precipitation.  Collister soils are moderately well drained and reaction is neutral or slightly acid.  Draper soils are not effervescent throughout.  Eastcan soils are moderately well drained with endosaturation commonly greater than 40 inches in depth.  Goose Creek soils have 27 to 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section.  Gosinta soils are moderately well drained and have very gravelly 2C horizons.  Heidtman soils have an aridic moisture regime.  Lakeview soils are not effervescent throughout, formed in alluvium derived from volcanic rocks, and are influenced by volcanic ash.  Oxy soils are moderately deep to lithic contacts.  Shoepeg soils have gravelly 2C horizons at 40 inches or more.  Willowdale soils are well drained and are very gravelly or extremely gravelly below 40 inches."

In September 1998 the taxonomic classification was changed from an Endoaquoll because the 40 to 50 cm layer doesn't have an aquic condition."
