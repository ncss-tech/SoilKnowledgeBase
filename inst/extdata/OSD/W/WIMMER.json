  "OVERVIEW": "The Wimmer series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sedimentary rocks mainly sandstone and shale.  Wimmer soils are on fan remnants and structural benches.  Slopes range from 1 to 6 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 36 cm and the mean annual temperature is about 8.0 degrees C.",
