  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitearth series consists of very deep, well drained, sodium-affected soils that formed in silty alluvium derived from lacustrine deposits.  These soils are on dissected alluvial fans, stream terraces, and dissected lake plains.  Slopes are 0 to 8 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
