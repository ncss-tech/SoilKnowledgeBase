  "OVERVIEW": "The Weetown series consists of very deep moderately well drained soils that formed in loamy sediments derived from glacial till or in glacial till on moraines.  These soils have slopes of 1 to 4 percent.  They have moderate permeability.  Mean annual temperature is about 42 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 24 inches.",

The control section has 18 to 28 percent clay.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 1 to 10 percent of the volume mostly in the lower part of the control section and in the C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral, but in some pedons the upper part of the A horizon may be slightly alkaline because of erosion sediments from the adjacent slopes.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  The clay content averages between 18 and 28 percent.  It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe Bk and C horizon have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The Bk horizons typically have a visible accumulation of secondary carbonates in the form of threads or masses."
