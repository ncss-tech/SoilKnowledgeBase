  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to free carbonates ranges from 25 to 72 inches.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 16 to 48 inches thick.  The control section has 18 to 28 percent clay.  Rock fragments of mixed lithology make up 1 to 10 percent of the volume mostly in the lower part of the control section and in the C horizon.\nThe Ap or A horizon has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam.  It is slightly acid or neutral, but in some pedons the upper part of the A horizon may be slightly alkaline because of erosion sediments from the adjacent slopes.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is sandy clay loam, sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  The clay content averages between 18 and 28 percent.  It is neutral to moderately acid.\nThe Bk and C horizon have hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6.  They are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam.  They are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline.  The Bk horizons typically have a visible accumulation of secondary carbonates in the form of threads or masses."

Slope gradients range from 1 to 4 percent.  The soil formed in loamy sediments derived from glacial till or in glacial till.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 45 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is 22 to 27 inches.  The frost free days range from 90 to 170 days.  The elevation above sea level ranges from 1000 to 1600 feet."

The poorly drained Friberg soils are downslope in the more concave parts on the landscape.  The moderately well drained Knute soils are in areas that do not receive sediment from upper sloping areas."
