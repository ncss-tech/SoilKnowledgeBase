  "OVERVIEW": "The Witt series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately or moderately slowly permeable soils that formed in eolian material and alluvium derived from sedimentary materials on fan terraces, piedmonts, bajadas and mesas. Slope ranges 0 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 11 inches and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Witt soils are on fan terraces, piedmonts, bajadas and mesas. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. They formed in silty calcareous sediments derived from mixed parent materials including quartzite, gneiss, sandstone, shale, limestone, eolian material, and Triassic and Jurassic redbed sediments. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 7,000 feet.\nIn Colorado, due to a prior correlation, this series has been allowed to range as cool as 47 degrees F., as high as 7400 feet, as moist as 15 inches of precipitation and with a frost free period with as few as 100 days."
