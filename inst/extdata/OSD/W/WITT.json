Almagre soils have a lithic contact between 40 and 60 inches of the surface. Monogram soils have a lithic contact between 60 and 80 inches of the surface. Snapill soils have a paralithic contact between 40 and 60 inches of the surface. Tetilla soils do not have a calcic horizon between 20 and 40 inches of the surface and have gravelly textures within 60 inches of the surface."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Witt soils are on fan terraces, piedmonts, bajadas and mesas. Slope ranges from 0 to 12 percent. They formed in silty calcareous sediments derived from mixed parent materials including quartzite, gneiss, sandstone, shale, limestone, eolian material, and Triassic and Jurassic redbed sediments. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 10 to 14 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 45 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free period ranges from 120 to 160 days. Elevation ranges from 5,200 to 7,000 feet.\nIn Colorado, due to a prior correlation, this series has been allowed to range as cool as 47 degrees F., as high as 7400 feet, as moist as 15 inches of precipitation and with a frost free period with as few as 100 days."
