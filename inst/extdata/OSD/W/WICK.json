Rock fragment content ranges from 0 to 2 percent in the A horizon, 0 to 5 percent in the B horizons, and 0 to 15 percent in the C horizons.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 1 to 4. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse, granular. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or N, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Structure is weak or moderate, fine to coarse, subangular blocky. Reaction is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y, or N or 5G, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. Texture is silt loam or silty clay loam. Below 40 inches some pedons have strata of silty clay, loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, loamy sand or their gravelly analogues. Reaction is strongly acid to neutral."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are Aetna, Canalschool (T), Nookchamps, Petrolia, Puget, Rafton, and Skagit. Aetna soils have a buried mollic epipedon that is 10 to 24 inches thick. Canalschool (T) have elevations of less than 400 ft msl. Nookchamps soils formed at elevations of 45 to 250 feet and have about 10 to 30 percent more precipitation. Petrolia soils have a solum greater than 40 inches thick. Puget soils have a mild marine climate. Rafton soils developed at elevations of 10 to 20 feet and receives about 25 percent more precipitation.  Skagit soils formed in alluvium high in volcanic ash content."

Slope ranges from 0 to 2 percent. Elevations are from 570 to 1,100 feet above msl. The mean annual temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation ranges from 29 to 43 inches. The frost free period is 133 to 198 days."

The moderately well drained Gageville and Pierpont soils, somewhat poorly drained Darien soils, and poorly drained Mill soils are on adjacent till plains. The well drained Chenango soils, moderately well drained Blakeslee soils, and somewhat poorly drained Red Hook soils are on adjacent outwash terraces. The very poorly drained Carlisle soils formed in organic materials on nearby depressions. The somewhat poorly drained Stanhope soils are on slightly higher landscape positions on flood plains."
