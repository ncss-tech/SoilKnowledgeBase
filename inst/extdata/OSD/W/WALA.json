Lomoine soils are dominated by fine gravel in the particle-size control section and have mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 14 degrees C. Wesfil soils are not intermittently moist during summer months, have rock fragments that are mainly phyllite and shale, and have mean annual soil temperature of 11 to 14 degrees C."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wala soils are on hills and mountains, occurring on backslope and summit positions. These soils formed in residuum, colluvium and alluvium from andesite, rhyolite and welded tuff. Slopes are 4 to 75 percent. Elevations are 1,463 to 2,710 meters. The climate is cool, semiarid with cool, moist winters and hot, dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is primarily 200 to 250 mm, but can extend up to 300 mm in Utah, mean annual temperature is 7 to 11 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 90 to 140 days."
