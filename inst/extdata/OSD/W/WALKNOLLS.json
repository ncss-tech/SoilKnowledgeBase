  "REVDATE": "12/2017",
  "STATES": "CO,UT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Walknolls series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in slope alluvium or colluvium over residuum from sandstone. Walknolls soils are on hills, cuestas, homoclinal ridges, structural benches, canyon walls and escarpments. Slopes are 2 to 70 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm, and mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
