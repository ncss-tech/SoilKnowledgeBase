  "OVERVIEW": "The Welcome series consists of deep, well drained soils\nformed in volcanic ash and colluvium and slope alluvium from sandstone modified slightly by glacial till.  Welcome soils\nare on glacially modified mountain ridges and shoulder\nslopes and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The average\nannual precipitation is about 60 inches and mean annual\ntemperature is about 44 degrees F.",
