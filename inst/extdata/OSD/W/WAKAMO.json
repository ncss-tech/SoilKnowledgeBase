  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE OF CHARACTERISTICS:  These soils are usually moist but are dry in the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is 35 to 50 percent clay and 60 to 70 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include all or part of the argillic horizon.  Base saturation is assumed to be 50 to 70 percent.\nThe A horizon has a value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 35 to 55 percent gravel.  The upper part of the A horizon has 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay.  It has 35 to 50 percent clay and 60 to 70 percent gravel."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wakamo soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep south-facing side slopes of uplands.  Elevations range from 2600 to 4000 feet. Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock with an influence of volcanic ash.  The mean annual precipitation is 16 to 20 inches, the mean annual temperature is 45 to 49 degrees F. and the frost-free period is 90 to 120 days."

Mowako soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to bedrock, and on adjacent south-facing side slopes.  Mutton soils are ashy-skeletal, deep to bedrock, and on north-facing side slopes. Peahke soils are loamy-skeletal, moderately deep to bedrock, and are on south-facing side slopes at higher elevations."
