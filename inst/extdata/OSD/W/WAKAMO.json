  "OVERVIEW": "The Wakamo series consists of shallow, well drained soils on mountains.  They formed in residuum and colluvium derived dominantly from sedimentary rock.  Slopes are 2 to 30 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 51 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock is 10 to 20 inches.  The particle-size control section is 35 to 50 percent clay and 60 to 70 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick and may include all or part of the argillic horizon.  Base saturation is assumed to be 50 to 70 percent.\nThe A horizon has a value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It contains 35 to 55 percent gravel.  The upper part of the A horizon has 5 to 20 percent volcanic glass and 0.4 to 1.0 percent acid oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half iron.\nThe Bt horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 4 or 5 dry and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and dry.  It is clay loam or clay.  It has 35 to 50 percent clay and 60 to 70 percent gravel."
