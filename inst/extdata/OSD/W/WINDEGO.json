The mean annual soil temperature is 42 to 47 degrees F. Depth to bedrock is over 60 inches. Depth to the buried argillic horizon and ash mantle thickness is 14 to 25 inches. The ash mantle contains 50 to 70 percent glass and glass-coated aggregate, phosphate retention of 60 to 80 percent, acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, and 15-bar water content of 5 to 10 percent on dried samples and 8 to 12 percent on undried samples. The soil is neutral throughout.\nThe Oi horizon is 1 to 3 inches, except where disturbed.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, moist or dry, value of 2 through 4 moist, 3 through 5 dry, chroma of 2 or 4 moist and 3 or 4 dry. It contains 5 to 10 percent gravel and 0 to 10 percent cobbles. Total rock fragments range from 5 to 15 percent. It has 1 to 4 percent organic matter. Field estimated clay content is 5 to 15 percent clay.\nThe 2Btb and 3Btb horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, moist or dry, value of 3 moist and 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 4 moist and 4 dry. It is very cobbly loam, very cobbly clay loam or extremely cobbly clay loam with 18 to 35 percent field estimated clay.
