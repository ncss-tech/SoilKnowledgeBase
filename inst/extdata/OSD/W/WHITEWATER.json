  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitewater series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in sodium-enriched residuum or alluvium over residuum derived from claystone.  Whitewater soils are on pediment slopes.  Saturated hydraulic conductivity is low.  Slopes range from 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 395 mm, and the mean annual air temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
