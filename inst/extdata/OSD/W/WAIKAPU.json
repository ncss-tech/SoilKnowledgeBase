  "OVERVIEW": "The Waikapu series consists of deep, well drained soils that formed in material weathered from old alluvium.  Waikapu soils are on alluvial fans and have slopes of 0 to 15 percent.  Mean annual rainfall is about 508 millimeters (20 inches) and mean annual temperature is about 23 degrees C. (73 degrees F.)",
