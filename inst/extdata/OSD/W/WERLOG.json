Green River soils have less than 18 percent clay in the particle-size control section and lack aquic conditions within 20 inches of the soil surface.  Walrees soils have a strongly contrasting particle-size class and lack aquic conditions within 20 inches of the surface. Werjo soils are moderately well drained and have aquic conditions deeper than 20 inches below the soil surface.  Youngston soils are well drained and lack a seasonal high water table within 5 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nEntisol feature - the lack of diagnostic horizons due to young soil age.\nFluventic feature - alluvial stratification and an irregular organic carbon distribution.\nUstic soil moisture regime - the presence of sufficient soil moisture for the ustic regime due to capillary rise above the seasonal high water table.\nAquic subgroup - Aquic conditions of saturation, reduction, and redoximorphic features in at least one subhorizon within 20 inches of the soil surface due to the capillary rise above a seasonal high water table as shallow as 24 inches\nNote:\n1.) The Werlog series was mapped with a depth to water table of 2 to 5 feet in the soil survey of San Juan County, New Mexico, Eastern Part.  This range is now narrowed to between 2.0 and 3.5 feet to better represent its drainage class of somewhat poorly drained.  This soil may be moderately well drained where it occurs with a water table depth between 42 and 60 inches (3.5 to 5 ft.).  These drier soils may not have enough natural soil moisture in the soil moisture control section during the warmer months of the year to qualify for the Ustic soil moisture regime.  This phase would now be within the range of the proposed Werjo series.\n2.) The Werlog soil as presently described is marginal in classification between an Aquic Ustifluvent and an Aeric Fluvaquent.  The typifying pedon has a matrix chroma of 2 in the C1 horizon but this horizon lacks redox concentrations.  Other pedons may have both of these morphologic features present in a layer between 15 and 20 inches (40 and 50 cm.).  If aquic conditions occur within this layer depth accompanied by the above features then the soil would fit within the Aquents suborder.  Near saturation conditions occur within the capillary fringe above the highest water table level at 24 inches.  Water will not stand in an unlined auger hole above 24 inches, but the soil horizons between 12 and 24 inches may be very wet.\n3.) An Aeric Fluvaquent would probably be poorly drained vs. somewhat poorly drained and would also be a Hydric soil.  Mapping inclusions of such hydric soils do occur within slightly lower portions of delineations of the Werlog series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
