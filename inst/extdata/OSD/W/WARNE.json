REVISED=9/7/2006, RLV,MC-restricted elevation to 8 to 25 to 800 feet, previously 100 to 450 feet. The July 2009 revision moves the type location from King and Queen County, VA to Rowan County, NC. This pedon better fits the central concept of the series.\nThe January 2026 revision changed the formatting.  No data was changed.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from 0 to 18 centimeters (0 to 7 inches) (A and E horizons)\nAlbic horizon--the zone from 10 to 18 centimeters (4 to 7 inches) (E horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 18 to 152 centimeters (7 to 60 inches) (Bt1, Bt2, Bt3, Btg1, Btg2, and Btg3 horizons)\nEndosaturation--saturation in all layers to a depth of 203 centimeters (80 inches)"
