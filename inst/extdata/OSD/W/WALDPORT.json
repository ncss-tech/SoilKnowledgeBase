The difference between the mean summer and mean winter temperature varies from 5 to 9 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 2 through 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 1 or 2 moist and dry. Texture is fine sand or loamy fine sand. Reaction is very strongly acid through moderately acid. Some pedons contain a few weakly cemented yellowish brown to brown nodules.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5 moist, 4 through 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y, value of 3 through 6 moist, 4 through 7 dry, and chroma of 3 or 4 moist and 1 through 4 dry.

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: This is the Frankport and Westport series. Frankport soils have more than 75 percent medium and coarse sand, a moist value of 1 or 2 throughout, and are weathered from heavy minerals such as chromite, ilmenite, and magnetite. Westport soils cannot be adequately separated and should be evaluated during an MLRA 4A update project."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Waldport soils are on recently stabilized sand dunes with undulating to hilly topography at elevations of 0 to 500 feet and slopes up to 70 percent on the leeward side. The soils formed in eolian sand of mixed mineralogy. The climate is maritime with cool moist summers and cool wet winters. The mean annual precipitation ranges from 60 to 100 inches. The mean January temperature is 43 degrees F. and the mean July temperature is 60 degrees F.  The mean annual temperature is 48 to 54 degrees F. The frost-free season is 180 to 300 days."

Bandon, Bullards, Netarts, and Yaquina soils have a spodic horizon. In addition, Yaquina soils are somewhat poorly drained. Ferrelo and Gearhart soils have an umbric epipedon more than 10 inches thick and have a cambic horizon. Heceta and Warrenton soils are poorly drained. The Bandon, Bullards, Ferrelo, and Netarts soils are on marine terraces.  Gearhart and Heceta soils are on stabilized dunes.  Warrenton soils are on long, narrow interdunal areas.  Yaquina soils are on marine terraces and low interdunes."

Native vegetation includes shorepine, Sitka spruce, salal, huckleberry, wax myrtle, and rhododendron with western hemlock and Douglas-fir in more sheltered areas; and beachgrass, American dunegrass, coyotebrush, lupine, mountain brome, and Scotch broom in more exposed or recently stabilized areas."
