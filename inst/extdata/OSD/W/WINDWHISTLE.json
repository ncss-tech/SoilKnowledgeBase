  "OVERVIEW": "The Windwhistle series consists of moderately deep, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils that formed in sandy eolian materials.  Windwhistle soils are on structural benches and cuestas and have slopes of 1 to 10 percent.  Average annual precipitation is 12 inches and the mean annual temperature is 50 degrees F.",
