  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soils have ochric epipedons and natric horizons.  They are usually moist but dry for 60 consecutive days in the summer.  The mean annual soil temperature is 59 degrees to 72 degrees F.  The mineralogy is mixed.  The solum is 24 to 44 inches thick.  The soils very in content of salts, alkali and lime, with the lime usually decreasing with depth.  The soils may have a thin salt crust, 1/4 to 1 inch thick,  grayish brown to white in color, which may be massive, vesicular or platy.  The A horizons range in color from gray to light gray and light brownish gray in 10YR, 2.5Y and 5Y hues with values of 4 to 7 and chromas of 1 and 2 and N 5/ to N 7/; in reaction from neutral to strongly alkaline and sometimes calcareous; in texture from fine sandy loam to clay loam.  Structure is usually massive but may be weak or medium blocky or platy.  Consistence is slightly hard or hard.  The Bt1 horizon ranges in color from gray to grayish brown, dark brown to olive brown to olive and olive gray in 2.5Y and 5Y hues with values of 4 and 5 and chromas of 2 to 4; in texture from heavy loam, sandy clay loam to silty clay loam; in reaction from moderately to very strongly alkaline.  The Btk horizons are calcareous with variable amounts of segregated and disseminated lime.  Structure is strong columnar to medium or strong prismatic in the upper Bt becoming blocky in the lower part.  The consistence is hard to extremely hard.  The C horizons are stratified, with medium, moderately coarse and coarse textures, usually becoming lighter in texture with depth.  They become less alkaline and calcareous with depth.  They may have medium to large lime concretions."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  In the same family is the Solano series.  Solano soils have medium acid A horizons and medium acid upper Bt horizons which become calcareous with depth.  Similar soils in a fine family are Orestimba which have clay Bt horizons.  Similar series in other orders are Hacienda, Pond, and Rossi.  Hacienda and Pond soils are usually dry.  Rossi soils have mollic epipedons and are poorly drained."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Waukena soils occur on nearly level basin-like areas in valley plains with slightly irregular or hummocky surface. They occur at elevations of less than 600 feet, in a semiarid, mesothermal climate with mean annual rainfall of 8 to 12 inches, with hot, dry summers and cool, moist winters.  Mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees to 63 degrees F., average January temperature 45 degrees F., and average July temperature about 82 degrees F.  Frost-free season averages about 250 days."
