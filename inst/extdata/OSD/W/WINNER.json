  "OVERVIEW": "The Winner series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed sources.  Winner soils are on flood plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
