  "OVERVIEW": "The Woofus series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from mixed rock sources with a component from loess and volcanic ash.  Woofus soils are on stream flood plains.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
