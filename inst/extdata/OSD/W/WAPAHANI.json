  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. In closely related families are the Losantville and Thrifton series. Losantville soils average more than 35 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are in the clayey particle-size class. Thrifton soils are in the superactive cation-exchange activity class. Other closely related soils that are not in the shallow family are the Adamstown, Beech, Blakeslee, Cazenovia, El Dara, Funkstown, Hilton, Kidami, Lima, Miami, Mt. Zion, Pevely, Rainsville, Rawson, Richland, Shawtown, Summitville, and Vaughnsville series. Adamstown, Beech, El Dara, Funkstown, Kidami, Miami, Rainsville, Rawson, Richland, Shawtown, and Vaughnsville soils are more than 50 cm (20 inches) to the base of the argillic horizon. Blakeslee, Cazenovia, and Hilton soils are deeper than 46 cm (18 inches) to carbonates. Lima soils have more than 10 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the series control section. Mt. Zion and Summitville soils have sola thicker than 50 cm (20 inches). Pevely soils have a lithic contact within a depth of 102 cm (40 inches)."

The somewhat poorly drained Crosby soils are moderately deep to dense till and are on higher lying summits and shoulder slopes. The Miami soils are moderately deep to dense till and are on more sloping shoulder slopes and backslopes on lower elevations. The poorly drained Treaty soils are very deep and are in depressions. The Williamstown soils are moderately deep to dense till and are on similar landforms."

The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from 30 to 61 cm (1.0 to 2.0 feet) between November and May in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is medium or high. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is moderately high in the solum and low to moderately high in the underlying dense till. Permeability is moderately slow in the solum and slow or very slow in the underlying dense till."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Wapahani soils have previously been correlated as moderately slowly permeable phases of the Strawn series and severely eroded phases of the Miami series. The central concept of the Wapahani series is that of severely eroded soils that are shallow to dense till. A new type location may be needed that does not have the densic contact at the 50 cm break.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 13 cm (Ap horizon).\nArgillic horizon: from a depth of 13 to 41 cm (Bt horizon).\nDensic contact: at 50 cm (top of the Cd horizon).\nAquic conditions: redox depletions in all horizons below a depth of 41 cm.\nA representative data mapunit for this pedon is 123781 in MO 11.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
