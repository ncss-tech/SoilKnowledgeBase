  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 58 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry and are dry between depths of 4 and 12 inches for a continuous period of about 70 to 85 days in the late summer.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is dominantly medium textured and averages 35 to 50 percent rock fragments.  Depth to the calcic horizon is 12 to 20 inches.  Bedrock below 40 and above 60 inches is common.  The average organic matter content in the surface 15 inches is about 1 to 2 percent.  If the upper 7 inches are mixed, the value is 5 to 6.5 dry and 3 to 4.5 moist; however, the value are not both darker than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist.  The chroma is commonly 2, but may be 3.  The hue of the entire soil is generally 10YR but is 2.5Y in some pedons.  The A1 horizon ranges from moderate or weak platy to weak subangular blocky or weak very fine granular structure.  Where mixed to 7 inches, the Ap horizon is slightly or moderately calcareous, but the upper few inches of some undisturbed pedons are noncalcareous.  The B or cambic horizon is light brownish gray or pale brown dry and very dark grayish brown, dark grayish brown, or brown moist.\nIt has weak prismatic or weak subangular blocky structure.  The depth to the Cca horizon ranges from 11 to 20 inches.  The Cca horizon contains 15 to 40 percent carbonates and is moderately to very strongly alkaline."

Hiko Peak soils have calcic horizons at depths of 7 to 12 inches.  Hondoho and Rudeen soils have mollic epipedons.  Portino and Portneuf soils have less than 35 percent fragments in the control section.  Sanpete soils have more than 50 percent rock fragments, lack cambic horizons, and have more than 40 percent calcium carbonate equivalent in the Cca horizon.  Siri soils have mean annual temperature colder than 47 degrees F."

The soils formed mostly in colluvium and local alluvium from loessial and basaltic sources.  The semiarid climate has mean annual precipitation of 8 to 12 inches, including 1 to 4 feet of snowfall, and an average frost free season of 100 to 150 days."
