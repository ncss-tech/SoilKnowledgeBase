The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 8 inches with 35 to 60 percent falling as rain from high-intensity thunderstorms between July and September. The mean annual temperature is 52 to 58 degrees F.

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to a depth of about 9 inches. (A and AB horizons)\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 9 to about 33 inches. (Bt1, Bt2, and Btk horizons)\nCalcic horizon - The zone from 33 to about 70 inches. (Bk1 and Bk2 horizons)\nClassified according to Soil Taxonomy Second Edition, 1999\nThe classification was changed from fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Haplargids to fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciargids in 2003.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Reference samples were taken at the series type location and analyzed for particle-size, organic matter, and calcium carbonate equivalence at the BIA soils lab in Gallup, NM as sample S88NM-045-2. Calcium carbonate equivalence on other pedons was determined with a field volume calcimeter. Lab results confirm the presence of a silicate clay bulge. Office wet sieve analyses of the horizons in the control section, confirm the placement in the fine-silty family.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
