    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: The Wirt soils are on flood plains and flood-plain steps along streams, mainly in dissected till plains considered to be formed during the Illinoian glacial stage. Slopes range from 0 to 2 percent. They formed in loamy alluvium. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 965 to 1168 mm (38 to 46 inches). Mean annual temperature ranges from 11 to 14 degrees C (52 degrees to 57 degrees F). Frost-free period is 160 to 190 days. Elevation is 122 to 280 meters (400 to 920 feet) above mean sea level."
