  "OVERVIEW": "The Walnett series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in material weathered from serpentinized peridotite. Walnett soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 75 percent. The mean annual temperature is 2670 millimeters (105 inches) and the mean annual temperature is 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",
