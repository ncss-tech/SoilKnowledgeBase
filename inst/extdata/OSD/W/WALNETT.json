  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Walnett soils are on mountain slopes and broad ridges. Slopes are 5 to 75 percent. Elevations are 55 to 1148 meters (180 to 3500 feet). The soils formed in material weathered from serpentinized peridotite. The climate is humid with warm, dry summers and cool, wet winters. Mean annual precipitation is 2290 to 3050 millimeters (90 to 120 inches). Mean January temperature is 3 degrees C (37 degrees F.), and mean July temperature is 17 degrees C (63 degrees F.). Mean annual temperature is 10 to 15 degrees C (50 to 59 degrees F). Frost-free season is estimated to be about 140 to 180 days."
