  "OVERVIEW": "The Winopee series is a member of the ashy over loamy, mixed family of Entic Cryorthods.  Typically, Winopee soils have a gray loamy sand A2 horizon, dark brown sand Bir horizons and stratified sand and gravelly coarse sand C horizons over buried dark brown gravelly loam B horizons.",
