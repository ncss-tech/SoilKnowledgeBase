  "OVERVIEW": "The Wrencoe series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in lacustrine sediments derived from mixed sources. Permeability is slow. These soils are on low terraces and floodplains and have slopes ranging from 0 to 2 percent. Average annual precipitation is about 32 inches and average annual air temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
