  "OVERVIEW": "The Wocus series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in material derived from water tolerant herbaceous plants over diatomaceous earth. The Wocus soils are on sag ponds and marshes in valleys. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
