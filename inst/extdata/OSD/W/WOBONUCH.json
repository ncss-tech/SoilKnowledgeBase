  "OVERVIEW": "The Wobonuch series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Wobonuch soils are on flood-plain steps of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1080 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
