Algerita and Yippin soils are inactive.  Cronese soils contain durinodes.  Grapevine, Kinley, Rillino, Whitlock soils have a calcic horizon above 20 inches.  Guijarral and Nikey soils do not have weak to strong cementation in the calcic horizon.  Cronese, Grapevine, Guijarral, Kinley and Nikey soils are moist in the soil moisture control section for less than 20 days cumulative between July and September and occur in the Mohave Desert."
