  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from 40 to 80 inches or more. Depth to rock is more than 60 inches. Sandstone and siltstone gravels and cobbles range from 0 to 6 percent in the upper part of the solum, 0 to 35 percent. in the lower part of the solum and from 0 to 50 percent in the substratum. Reaction ranges from strongly to very strongly acid, unless limed.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silt loam or loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 7.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 8. It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the upper part and silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, clay loam, or sandy clay loam in the lower part. Some pedons have redoximorphic features in shades of brown, yellow or gray below a depth of 40 inches. Some pedons have BA, BE, or 2Bt horizons with similar colors and textures.\nThe BC and C horizons have colors and textures similar to the lower part of the Bt horizon, but also include textures of  sandy loam and fine sandy loam.\nA lithologic discontinuity is present in many pedons along narrow streams but is not required."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: These are the Cabool(T), Chillum, Fletcher, Gnawbone, Jessietown, Matapeake, Nassawango and Wernock series in the same family and the Talleyville series which has not yet been assigned a CEC activity class. Cabool soils are moderately deep and formed in loess and the underlying residuum of sandstone and limestone bedrock. The Chillum, Matapeake and Nassawango soils have thinner solums and formed in silty eolian material underlain by coarse fluvial or loamy marine coastal plain sediments. Fletcher soils have redder Bt horizons and hard phyllite bedrock within a depth of 65 inches. Gnawbone and Wernock soils are moderately deep, formed in residuum weathered from siltstone and have paralithic contacts. Jessietown soils are moderately deep and formed in residuum weathered from acid black shale. Talleyville soils have sola 4 to 7 feet thick, with the upper part formed in a silty mantle and the lower part formed in residuum from basic igneous rocks."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Whitley soils are on stream terraces, foot slopes and alluvial fans with slope gradients of 0 to 12 percent. They formed in alluvium weathered from Pennsylvanian aged siltstone, sandstone and shale. Near the type location mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches and the average annual temperature is about 52 degrees F."

Cotaco and Morehead soils are somewhat poorly or moderately well drained. Cuba, Lindside, Newark, Nolin and Stendal soils are on flood plains and lack argillic horizons."

Forests are mixed hardwood, chiefly of oaks, hickories, dogwood, yellow poplar, elm, hop hornbeam, beech, and in places hemlock, Virginia, shortleaf and white pine."

    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 2005 revision assigns the activity class as semiactive; revises the type location and geographic settings; and narrows the range of landform locations. Traditionally, Whitley soils have been mapped on ridgetops over interbedded siltstone and sandstone. These areas have been largely re-mapped as the Lonewood or Rayne Series.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
