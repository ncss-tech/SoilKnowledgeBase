  "OVERVIEW": "The Wendover series consists of shallow, well drained, moderately rapidly permeable soils on mountainsides and hill slopes. They formed in colluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Slope ranges from 10 to 60 percent. Mean annual air temperature is 46 to 52 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is 13 to 17 inches.  The frost free season is 115 to 130 days.",
