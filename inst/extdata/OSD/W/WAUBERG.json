  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The solum is 50 to 75 inches thick. Soil reaction ranges from very strongly to slightly acid in the A horizon and strongly acid to neutral in the Bt and Cg horizons.\nTexture of the A horizon is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, or loamy fine sand.  The A1 horizon has hue of 10YR or N, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or less.  It is 5 to 9 inches thick.  Where\nthickness is only 5 or 6 inches, the color when mixed with A2 horizon to a depth of 7 to 9 inches is very dark gray.  The A2 horizon has hue of N, 10YR, or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 2 or less, with or without mottles of yellow and brown. It is 15 to 32 inches thick.\nThe B21tg horizon has hue of 10YR or N, value of 4 through 6, chroma of 1 or less, with or without mottles in various shades of yellow, brown, and red.  Texture is sandy clay loam, with clay content ranging from 24 to 35 percent.  The B22tg horizon has the same color range as the B21tg horizon.  Texture is sandy clay loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam with clay content of 18 to 35 percent.  The B3g horizon has hue of 10YR or N, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or less, with mottles in shades of yellow, brown, and red.  Texture is the same as the B22tg horizon.  Thin streaks and pockets of finer and coarser textured material occur in this horizon in some pedons.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR or N, value of 5 through 7, and chroma of 1 or less, with yellow, brown, and red mottles.  Texture is sandy clay or clay and contains thin streaks and pockets of sandy loam and sandy clay loam materials in some pedons."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  There are no other series in the same family.  Closely similar soils are the Blichton, Eaton, and Floridana series.  Blichton soils have less than 35 percent base saturation\nand more than 5 percent plinthite in the argillic horizon.  Eaton soils have finer textured argillic horizons.  Floridana soils have mollic epipedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wauberg soils occur in wet prairies and low areas within the broad flatwoods of central and southern Florida.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  These soils formed in thick beds of loamy textured marine sediments.  Average annual precipitation near the type location is about 55 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F."

Emeralda soils have finer textured argillic horizons.  Felda soils have thinner dark colored epipedons. Kaliga soils are very poorly drained and are of organic origin.  Monteocha soils are very poorly drained, and both Monteocha and Wauchula soils have spodic horizons."

A few areas are wooded with slash and longleaf pine, sweetgum, and red maple.  The areas are mostly used for wildlife, some are used for rangeland or\npasture."
