  "OVERVIEW": "The Windfetch series consists of well drained soils that formed in a thin, discontinuous layer of human transport materials overlying uplifted alluvium from marine and other mixed rock sources. Windfetch soils are on uplifted alluvium and terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 368 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 18 degrees C.",
