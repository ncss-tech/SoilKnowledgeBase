    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The control section has variable textures within short horizontal distances.  It is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or coarse sand.  There is an irregular decrease in organic carbon with depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.  It is loamy sand or very fine sandy loam.\nSome pedons have Bw horizons.\nThe C horizons have hue of 5YR to 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 2 to 6 and chroma of 0 to 6. Horizons with value of 2 or 3 are stratified with thin strata with value of 4 or more.  Redox features with chroma of 2 or less are within depths of less than 40 inches.  Reaction of the C horizons ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline. Some pedons are moderately alkaline below depths of 40 inches.  Thin strata of gravelly sand or gravelly loamy sand is in some pedons."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winterfield soils are on flood plains that overflow occasionally or frequently for brief periods.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The soils formed in sandy alluvium.  The mean annual precipitation ranges from 27 to 34 inches.  Mean annual temperature ranges from 39 to 47 degrees F.  Frost free days range from 90 to 140.  Elevation above sea level ranges from 600 to 1,400 feet."

Evart soils are on similar landscape positions, are poorly drained, and have mollic epipedons.  Grayling, Rubicon, Kalkaska and Zimmerman soils are on adjoining uplands and do not flood."

The soil has an apparent seasonal high water table that ranges from .5 to 3.0 feet below the surface at times during the period from November to May. The soil is subject rare to frequent flooding during periods from November to May. Runoff is negligible or very low. Permeability is rapid."
