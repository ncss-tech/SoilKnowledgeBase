These soils formed in thick beds of sandy material. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 to 42 inches. Mean annual temperature ranges from 59 to 63 degrees F. Thornthwaite annual P-E indices range from 60 to 72."

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Glentosh, Larton, and Porum soils. Glentosh soils have A horizons more than 20 inches thick, have a sandy control section, and occur on slightly higher landscapes. Larton soils are on higher terraces and have sola that do not decrease more than 20 percent in clay content from the maximum in the Bt2 horizons and have A horizons more than 20 inches thick. Porum soils occur on higher terraces and have a fine particle-size control section."
