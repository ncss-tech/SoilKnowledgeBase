  "STATES": "OK",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Weleetka series consist of very deep, very poorly drained, moderately slowly permeable soils on side slopes of forested eolian reworked terraces on uplands of the Arkansas Valley and Ridges Western (MLRA 118B) that formed in thick beds of sandy material. These very gently sloping to strongly sloping soils are on side slopes that are parallel to drainageways and stream channels. Slopes range from 2 to 12 percent. Mean annual precipitation is 39 inches. Mean annual air temperature is 61 degrees F.",
