  "OVERVIEW": "The Wenona series consists of moderately well drained soils formed in loess or other silty material and in the underlying clayey till or lacustrine sediments on ground moraines or lake plains. Slope gradients range from 2 to 15 percent. Mean annual precipitation  is about 914 mm (36 inches) and mean annual air temperature is about 10 degrees C (50 degrees F).",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: The depth to the base of soil development typically is 114 to 140 cm (45 to 55 inches)and ranges to shallow as 102 cm (40 inches) in some pedons. The loess or silty material typically is 89 to 114 cm (35 to 45 inches) thick and ranges to 140 cm (55 inches) in thickness and is underlain by till or lacustrine sediments. The dominant clay mineral in the loess or silty material is smectite and in the till or lacustrine sediments is illite. The mollic epipedon is 25 to 51 cm (10 to 20 inches) thick. The particle-size control section averages from 35 to 42 percent clay and less than 5 percent fine sand or coarser. Reaction commonly ranges from moderately acid to strongly acid in the upper part of the series control section and from slightly acid to slightly alkaline in the lower part.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2. It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It is silty clay loam or silty clay.\nThe 2Bt, 2BCt, 2BC, or 2Bk horizon commonly has hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 2 to 6. Chroma of 2 is present either as redoximorphic features or matrix color. The texture is silty clay or silty clay loam.\nThe 2Cd horizon commonly has a hue of 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6 , and chroma of 2 to 4. It is silty clay or clay. Carbonates are present, and reaction is slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline."
