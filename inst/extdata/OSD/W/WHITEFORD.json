  "OVERVIEW": "The Whiteford series consists of very deep, well drained, moderately permeable soils on uplands. They formed in residuum from dark colored slate and/or phyllite. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. Mean annual temperature is about 52 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 42 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

Flat fragments of slate and/or phyllite range from 0 to 25 percent in the solum and 30 to 70 percent in the C horizon. Most fragments are less than 6 inches in length, but a few are as long as 15 inches. Reaction is strongly acid or very strongly acid unless the soil is limed, and acidity commonly increases with depth.\nThe Ap horizon has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4, It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe A and E horizons were present has hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4, with value of 3 confined to the A horizon.  It is loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe AB horizon has horizon of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, chroma of 3 through 6. It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 8.

None of the competing series contain fragments of slate in the control section.  Allegheny soils are terrace positions and formed alluvium derived from sandstone, siltstone and shale.  Allenwood, Chetwynd and Leck Kill soils are formed from glacial till.  Drapermill and Glenelg soils are formed from micaceous schist and phyllite.  Frankstown soils are formed from siliceous limestone.  Gilpin and Gilwood soils are moderately deep and formed from sedimentary rocks.  Murrill soils are formed from colluvium of sandstone and shale over limestone.  Queponco and Reybold are formed from fluvio-marine sediments.  Rhodiss and Tate soils formed in residuum from granite, gneiss and other crystalline rocks.  Ungers soils formed from red sandstones and shales."

They are nearly level to moderately steep soils on ridgetops at higher elevations than most associated soils. Slopes range from 0 to 25 percent. The climate is temperate and humid. The mean annual temperature is about 50 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches."

Chester, Elioak, Glenelg, Glenville, and Manor soils formed in materials weathered from mica schist. These associated soils are at lower elevations than the Whiteford soils."
