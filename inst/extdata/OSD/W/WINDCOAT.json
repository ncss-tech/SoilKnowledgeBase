The soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  The climate is cold and moist in winter and dry in summer.  Average annual precipitation ranges from 8 to 11 inches.  Average summer temperature is 53 to 56 degrees F, and the average annual air temperature is 35 to 38 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 30 to 60 days."
