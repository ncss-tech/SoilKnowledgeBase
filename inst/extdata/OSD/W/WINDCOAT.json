  "OVERVIEW": "The Windcoat series consists of shallow to a duripan, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived dominantly from limestone.  Windfall soils are on outwash fans and fan terraces and have slopes of 2 to 20 percent.  Permeability is moderate above the duripan.  The average annual precipitation is about 9 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 36 degrees F.",
