    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Classification change from Udertic Haplustalfs to Oxyaquic Vertic Haplustalfs based on knowledge that these soils are saturated for 2 to 4 weeks in most years. This period of time is within the definition of saturation for one month or more if rules of rounding are applied, i.e., 2 to 6 weeks saturation is considered inclusive.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nParticle size control section:  13 to 63 cm (5 to 25 in) (Bt1 and Btssgy1 horizons)\nOchric epipedon: 0 to 13 cm (0 to 5 in). The surface horizon is massive and hard or very hard when dry but is soft or friable when moist. (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon: 13 to 165 cm (5 to 65 in). (Bt and Btkssgy1 horizons)\nSlickensides: 51 to 203 cm (20 to 80 in). (Btkssgy1 and Btkssgy2 horizons)\nSecondary gypsum: 51 to 165 cm (20 to 65 in). (Btkssgy1 and Btkssgy2 horizons)\nSecondary carbonates: 51 to 203 cm (20 to 80 in). (Btkssgy1, Btkssgy2, and BCKss horizons)\nReduced matrix: 51 to 165 cm (20 to 65 in). (Btkssgy1 and Btkssgy2 horizons)\nVertic feature: When dry, cracks at least 6 mm (0.25 in) wide extend from the top of the argillic horizon through a thickness of 30 cm (12 in) or more within the upper 127 cm (50 in) of the soil.\nLinear Extensibility: The linear extensibility is greater than 6 cm (2.5 in) within 102 cm (40 in) of the soil surface.\nCoefficient of linear extensibility (COLE): 0.07 to 0.10 in the upper 127 cm (50 in) of the argillic horizon.\nOther Features: The surface layer is variable in thickness with a series of micro crests and troughs in the Bt horizon that range from 1.2 to 6.1 m (4 to about 20 ft) apart. The soil does not have aquic soil conditions in the upper 51 cm (20 in) in most years.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Type location pedon KSSL S1962TX257001 Kaufman County, Texas, KSSL pedon S10TX2930015 from Limestone County, Texas, Texas A&M University pedon S09TX3090014 from McLennan County, Texas,  Texas A&M University pedon S63TX-145-1, and Texas A&M University pedon S82TX-289-32.\nTaxonomic Version: Keys to Soil Taxonomy, Twelfth Edition, 2014\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
