  "OVERVIEW": "The Wanship series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from sandstone and conglomerate.  Wanship soils are on flood plains and stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 18 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
