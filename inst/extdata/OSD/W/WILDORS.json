  "OVERVIEW": "The Wildors series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed in eolian material over basalt.  Wildors soils are on basalt plains and buttes and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  Permeability is moderate.  The average annual precipitation is about 12 inches, and the average annual air temperature is about 47 degrees F.",
