    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wildors soils are on basalt plains and buttes.  Slopes range from 2 to 15 percent.  Elevation ranges from 4,500 to 5,000 feet.  The soil formed in eolian material over basalt.  The average annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches, most of which falls as snow and early spring rains.  The average annual air temperature is about 45 degrees to 50 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 85 to 120 days."

Deerhorn soils contain less than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section.  Cox soils are 10 to 20 inches deep.  Pagari and Rehfield soils are greater than 40 inches deep and lack duripans.  McCarey and Pedleford soils lack duripans and have MAST less than 47 degrees F.  Molyneux soils are very deep, lack a duripan, and have an average annual soil temperature of less than 47 degrees F.  Deerhorn, Cox, Pedleford, McCarey, and Pagari soils occur on convex positions on basalt plains.  Molyneux and Rehfield soils occur in drainageways and depressions."
