  "OVERVIEW": "The Willamar series consists of deep, somewhat poorly drained,\nvery slowly permeable soils that formed in loamy sediments.\nThese soils are on flats on coastal plains.  Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 24 degrees C (75 degrees F) and mean annual precipitation is about 700mm (28 inches).",
