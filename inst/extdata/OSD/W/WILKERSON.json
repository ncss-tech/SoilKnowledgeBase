  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilkerson series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium.  Wilkerson soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 305 mm (12 inches) and the mean annual temperature is about 2.8 degrees C (37 degrees F).",
