  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Mean annual soil temperature ranges from 37 to 41 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 15 inches thick.  Wesdy soils are typically noncalcareous to depths of more than 60 inches but calcareous materials do occur at depths of 40 to 60 inches in some pedons.  Rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent with the main part being less than 10 inches in diameter.  Clay content of the particle-size control section ranges from 35 to 50 percent.  The moisture control section is usually moist during the time the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 degrees F.  Skeletans and blotches of nonalbic E materials are common below the A horizon.  An O horizon is present in some pedons.\nThe A horizons have hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 3 through 5, 2 or 3 moist, with chroma of 1 through 3.  Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe Bt horizons have hue of 10YR through 5YR, value of 4 through 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, with chroma of 3 through 6.  Texture is clay or clay loam.   Reaction is moderately acid through neutral.\nThe C horizon, when present, has variegated hue of 10YR through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 6.  Texture is clay or clay loam.  Reaction is moderately acid through slightly alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wesdy soils are on mountain and high valley side slopes and footslopes.  Slopes are 3 to 65 percent.  The soil formed in residuum and colluvium and from interbedded sandstone and shale with basalt overburden and in glacial till from basalt, sandstone and shale.  Elevation ranges from 7,800 to 10,500 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 24 to 36 inches with the major part occurring as snow.  Mean annual temperatures range from 34 to 42 degrees F.  Frost-free period is 50 to 80 days."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  The soil name is coined from a prominent creek in the area.  Diagnostic features include a mollic epipedon from 0 to 11 inches, and an argillic horizon from 11 to 26 inches.  The soil has a udic moisture regime and a cryic temperature regime.  This revision documents a change in minerology from mixed to montmorillonitic, based on NSSL data.  Last updated by the state 6/95.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
