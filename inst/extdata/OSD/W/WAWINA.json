  "OVERVIEW": "The Wawina series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in sediments that are dominantly very fine sand.  They are on lacustine plains, deltas and river terraces.  These soils have moderately rapid permeability.  Slopes range from 0 to 12 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.  Mean annual precipitation is about 25 inches.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to free carbonates exceeds 60 inches in most pedons.  The 10- to 40-inch particle-size control section averages 50 to 75 percent of very fine sand, 5 to 25 percent of silt, 2 to 10 percent of clay, and the total of silt plus clay not exceeding 30 percent.  The soil moisture control section is dry for 20 to 35 consecutive days during the 120 days following the summer solstice.\nThe Oi or Oe horizon is comprised of conifer tree needles, deciduous tree leaves and remains of forest floor flora.  It has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 to 4.\nSome pedons have an A horizon having hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is 0 to 2 inches thick.  Some pedons have an Ap horizon, but the dry color is greater than chroma of 5.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is loamy very fine sand or very fine sand.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 10YR, 7.5YR, or 2.5Y, value of 4 or 6, and chroma of 3 or 4.  It is loamy very fine sand or very fine sand.  It is strongly acid to slightly acid.  The thin discontinuous lamellae and nodules have a slightly higher content of clay or silt than in the surrounding soil.  Some pedons do not have nodules or lamellae.\nWhen present, the C horizon has hue of 2.5Y or 10YR, value of 5 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 4.  It is very fine sand or loamy very fine sand.  It is moderately acid to neutral."

Bice, Elka, Franklinville, Haights, Lanesboro, Millsite, Mongaup, and Vershire soils all are in higher precipitation areas which have a soil moisture control section that has less than 20 consecutive days dry for 120 days following the summer solstice.  Conic and Mesaba soils have a lithic contact within 40 inches of the surface.  Lode soils have rock fragments throughout the solum and C horizons, and have greater than 25 percent medium or coarse sand in the C horizon.  Toimi soils have dense till (paralithic contact) within 60 inches or the series control section."
