    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 10 to 30 inches and depth to lithic or paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Shale fragments range from 5 to 90 percent by volume in individual horizons of the A and Bw horizons, 35 to 90 percent in the C horizon, and average over 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Shale fragment content increases with depth.  The soil is very strongly acid through mildly alkaline in the solum and neutral through mildly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam or loam .\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon has color similar to the C horizon.  It consists of highly weathered shale and limestone."

Alton soils are more than 40 inches to bedrock.  Hatchery soils have an annual precipitation of 60 to 80 inches.  Pennichuck soils have fine sandy loam, sandy loam or loam B horizons.  Digger soils have an annual precipitation of 60 to 80 inches and a medial-skeletal particle-size control section. Whitesburg soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments in the particle-size control section.  Jason soils have a paralithic contact within 20 inches.  Litz soils have less than 35 percent saturation in the subhorizon just above lithic contact."
