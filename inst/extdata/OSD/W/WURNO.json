  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Wurno series are moderately deep and well drained with moderate permeability.  They formed in the weathered products of shale, interbedded with thin layers of limestone on uplands.  Slopes range from 0 to 75 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches and mean annual temperature is about 54 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness is 10 to 30 inches and depth to lithic or paralithic contact is 20 to 40 inches.  Shale fragments range from 5 to 90 percent by volume in individual horizons of the A and Bw horizons, 35 to 90 percent in the C horizon, and average over 35 percent in the particle-size control section.  Shale fragment content increases with depth.  The soil is very strongly acid through mildly alkaline in the solum and neutral through mildly alkaline in the substratum.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 3 through 5, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is silt loam or loam .\nThe B horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 3 through 8.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 4 through 8.  It is silt loam or loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Cr horizon has color similar to the C horizon.  It consists of highly weathered shale and limestone."
