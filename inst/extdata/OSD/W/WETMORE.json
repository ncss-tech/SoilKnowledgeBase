  "OVERVIEW": "The Wetmore series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained, rapidly permeable soils formed in thin gravelly coarse textured noncalcareous materials weathered from granite.  Wetmore soils are on mountain slopes and have slopes of 5 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 23 inches and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Rock fragments range from 35 to 75 percent and are dominantly angular pebbles of 1 to 3 inch diameter.  Hue is 2.5YR through 10YR in the argillic horizon.  The soil ranges from moderately acid through neutral."
