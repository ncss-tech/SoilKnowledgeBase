  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 41 to 47 degrees F. and the mean summer temperature at a depth of 20 inches ranges from 60 to 66 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry and are dry between depths of 8 and 24 inches for about 70 t0 90 consecutive days in the summer.  The 10 to 40 inch control section averages 8 to 18 percent clay, more than 15 percent particles coarser than very fine sand, and less than 10 percent rock fragments.  The upper 10 to 25 inch portion of the control section is dominantly moderately coarse textured (mostly fine sandy loam) and overlies silt loam stratified with loam and/or below 40 inches with sandy loam.  The mollic epipedon ranges from 5 to 12 inches thick.  Depth to strongly calcareous material ranges from 5 to 20 inches.  The profile has 10YR or 2.5Y hue.  The Ap or A1 horizon, when mixed to 7 inches, has value of 4.8 to 5.5 dry, 2.8 to 3.5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It ranges in organic matter content from 1.2 to 2.5 percent, in pH from 7 to 8.1, and in noncalcareous to moderately calcareous.  The C horizon has value of 5.5 to 7 dry, 3.5 to 5 moist, and chroma of 1 through 3.  It is massive or has weak subangular blocky structure.  This horizon contains 15 to 45 percent calcium carbonate."

Ammon and Newdale soils have less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.  Blue Star and Courtrock  soils have a mean annual temperature warmer than 47 degrees F.  Bock soils have a medium textured control section and a cambic horizon.  Fanu and Wahtigup soils have more than 18 percent clay in the control section.  Stan soils have a calcic horizon and lack the silt loam in the lower part of the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The soils are on level to gently sloping terraces at elevations of 4,200 to 4,600 feet.  Slopes range from 0 to 4 percent.  The soils formed in moderately coarse textured over medium textured sediments, dominantly from quartzite and sedimentary rock sources but also containing rhyollitic, basaltic or granitic materials.  In Places, the upper part may be eolian sediments.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10.5 to 13 inches, including 2 to 5 feet of snowfall.  The average frost free season is 100 to 125 days."
