Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the subsoil and very high in the underlying material. Permeability is moderately rapid in the subsoil and very rapid in the underlying material. These soils are subject to flooding for brief to long periods."

Transect data  (T93IN-039-235) for the typical pedon is on file in MLRA project office, Plymouth, Indiana. Transect shows 60 percent Waterford soils, 20 percent Abscota, coarse-loamy soils, 10 percent Algansee soils, and 10 percent Cohoctah soils.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
