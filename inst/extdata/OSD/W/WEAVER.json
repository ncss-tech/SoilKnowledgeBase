  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to bedrock and thickness of solum ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  The amount of nodules of lime and soft marly material ranges from none to about 10 percent of the volume in the Ap and B2 horizons, and from 15 to 50 percent in the B3, C, and A1b horizons.  Reaction ranges from neutral to moderately alkaline in the A and B horizons and from mildly alkaline to moderately alkaline in the C horizon.\nThe Ap horizon is brown (10YR 4/3), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4).  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.\nThe B horizon is yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), olive brown (2.5Y 4/4), light olive brown (2.5Y 5/4), brown (10YR 4/3), or dark yellowish brown (10YR 4/4) with few to common mottles of gray, brown, and yellow, and the range includes dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2) without significant mottling.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam; clay content ranges from about 22 to 35 percent.\nThe C horizon has a dominant color of yellowish brown (10YR 5/4, 5/6), olive brown (2.5Y 4/2), olive (5Y 5/3, 5/4, 5/6, 4/3, 4/4), dark grayish brown (10YR 4/2), grayish brown (10YR 5/2; N 5/ ), or gray with common or many mottles; or it is highly mottled with these colors and lacks dominant color.  It is silt loam or silty clay loam.  In some pedons the A1b horizon is absent and the C horizon terminates on shale or limestone rock or on a gravelly or clayey substratum at depths of 4 to 5 feet or more."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Bruin, Eel, Lindside, Lobdell, Marietta, Melvin, Middlebury, Newark, Senecaville, and Whitesburg series.  Each of these lack the nodules of lime and soft marly material in the soil and are less alkaline than Weaver soils.  Also, in the 10- to 40-inch control section, Lindside soils have less than 15 percent material coarser than very fine sand, and Bruin and Middlebury soils have less than 18 percent clay. Melvin and Newark soils are dominantly gray below the plow layer.  Bruin and Marietta soils have mean annual temperature more than 59 degrees F."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weaver soils are on narrow, nearly level bottomlands along springfed creeks and branches.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  These soils formed in alluvium from soils which formed in limestone residuum.  The mean annual air temperature near the type location is 56.4 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 41 inches."
