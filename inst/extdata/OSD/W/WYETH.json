The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 36 inches thick.  The control section averages 35 to 75 percent rock fragments and 18 to 27 percent clay.  The sola range from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is loam and has 15 to 60 percent gravel, 15 to 50 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.  This horizon has weak to moderate fine or medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry."
