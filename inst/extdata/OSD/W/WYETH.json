  "OVERVIEW": "The Wyeth series consists of deep and very deep, well drained soils that formed in mixed loess, volcanic ash and basalt colluvium.  These soils are on north-facing slopes and have slope of 5 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 47 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 49 degrees F.",

The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 50 to 53 degrees F.  Depth to bedrock ranges from 40 to more than 60 inches.  The umbric epipedon is 20 to 36 inches thick.  The control section averages 35 to 75 percent rock fragments and 18 to 27 percent clay.  The sola range from moderately acid to neutral.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It has 10 to 50 percent gravel, 5 to 30 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.\nThe AC horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3 moist, 4 or 5 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and 3 or 4 dry.  It is loam and has 15 to 60 percent gravel, 15 to 50 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones.  This horizon has weak to moderate fine or medium subangular blocky structure.\nThe C horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 through 4 moist and dry."
