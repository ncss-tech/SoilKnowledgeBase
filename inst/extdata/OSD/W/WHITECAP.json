  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitecap series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in residuum from granitic and related rocks.  Whitecap soils are on mountains and have slopes of 5 to 60 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 38 inches and the mean annual air temperature is about 32 degrees F.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 30 to 38 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature at the paralithic contact is 49 to 59 degrees F., if no O horizon.  The soils are not dry in some part below 12 inches for 60 consecutive days in more than 7 out of 10 years and are not dry in some part below 12 inches for 90 cumulative days.  The mineralogy is mixed.  A paralithic contact with somewhat weathered granitic bedrock is at 10 to 20 inches.  The control section is loamy sand or coarser, commonly is fine gravelly, but contains less than 35 percent coarse fragments.  The dark surface layer is not thick enough (4 to 9 inches) and high enough in organic matter to qualify for an umbric (or mollic) epipedon.  Some pedons have a very thin faint A2 horizon immediately below the O horizon, consisting of coarse sand and 40 to 70 percent fine gravel.  The profiles have a 10YR hue.\nThe A1 horizon has a color value of 5 dry and 3 moist and a chroma of 3 or 2.  The structure ranges from very weak subangular blocky to weak granular.  The reaction is mostly medium acid but ranges from pH 5.5 to 6.2.  The base saturation of the A1 horizon is likely less than 50 percent.  The organic matter in the A1 horizon is estimated to have a C:N ratio of 15 to 19.\nThe C1 layer ranges in color value from 6 to 8 dry and 4 to 6 moist.  The texture ranges from fine gravelly loamy coarse sand to gravelly coarse sand, and the horizon is mainly structureless.  The lower part of the C layer has remnants of the bedrock structure.  The reaction of the C layer is mostly medium acid, and the acidity tends to increase slightly with depth.  One or more very thin brown lamellae are common in the C1 or C2 layer, and one or more may be in the upper part of the weathered bedrock."

Similar soils are the Blanchard, Bryan, Clark Fork, Corbett, Elmira, Graylock, Hanks, Koppes, McCaffery, Pyle, Quartzburg, Stacum, and Toiyabe series.  All except the Toiyabe soils have no bedrock within 20 inches of the surface.  The Blanchard, Clark Fork, Corbett, Elmira, McCaffery, and Quartzburg soils have a mean summer soil temperature at 20 inches warmer than 59 degrees F., if no O horizon.  The Blanchard, Clark Fork, and McCaffery soils are dry in some subhorizon between 12 and 36 inches for 90 cumulative days.  The Bryan soils have an umbric epipedon.  The Graylock and Stecum soils have more than 35 percent coarse fragments in the control section.  The Hanks soils have a moderately coarse textured cambic horizon.  The Koppes soils have a mollic epipedon.  The Quartzburg soils have a paralithic contact between 20 and 40 inches.  The Toiyabe soils have a mean summer temperature at the paralithic contact warmer than 59 degrees F., if no O horizon, and are dry below 12 inches for 60 consecutive days or longer."

All slope aspects are represented.  The elevations are 6,000 to 8,700 feet.  The soils are forming in residuum weathered from quartz nonzonite and related bedrock.  The mean annual precipitation is 32 to 45 inches, including 10 to 15 feet of snowfall.  The average freeze-free period ranges from about 20 to 70 days."
