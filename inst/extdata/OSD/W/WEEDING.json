The soils have mottles with chroma of 2 or less within 40 inches of the surface or are continuously saturated for as long as 90 days within a depth of 40 inches where drained.  The 10 to 40 inch control section is dominantly loamy sand or loamy fine sand, and it contains no strongly contrasting textures and less than 15 percent rock fragments.  The mollic epipedon is 10 to 20 inches thick.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4.5 to 5.5 dry, 2.5 to 3.5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  It has 1 to 2 percent organic matter.  The C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 1 or 2.5.  The soils are slightly or moderately calcareous throughout except the upper few inches may be noncalcareous.  Only a weak accumulation of calcium carbonate or no accumulation is above a depth of 40 inches."

Duelm soils are noncalcareous, have cambic horizons, and sola 30 to 60 inches thick which are medium to very strongly acid.  Firth soils have a moderately coarse textured control section.  Flaming soils have sola typically 20 to 40 inches thick dominated by fine sand which is medium to slightly acid.  Flaming soils also have cambic horizons and typically are noncalcareous to depths of 40 to 60 inches.  Ormsby soils have a mean annual soil temperature warmer than 47 degrees F.  Osakins soils are underlain by sand and gravel at depths of 12 to 25 inches and are noncalcareous.  Presto, Wapello, and Wolverine soils mottles and saturation with water above 40 inches.  Ulen soils have Aca and Bca horizons.  Walum soils formed in shale and contain more than 50 percent sand size shale fragments."

The soils formed mostly in loamy sand alluvium or eolian deposits.  The material is from mixed sources.  The climate is semiarid with dry summers.  The mean annual precipitation is 10 to 13 inches, including 2 to 5 feet of snow.  The average frost free season is 94 to 125 days."
