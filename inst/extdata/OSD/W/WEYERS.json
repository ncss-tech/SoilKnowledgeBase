    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other series in this family. The Sandusky series is in a related family. The Sandusky soils average between 18 and 27 percent clay in the particle-size control section and are underlain by lacustrine sediments at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches)."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Weyers soils are on broad, nearly level lake plains adjacent to subterranean springs or seepage areas with calcium carbonate charged water that flowed or are flowing from limestone. Slope ranges from 0 to 1 percent. The soils formed in 102 to 152 cm (40 to 60 inches) of calcareous tufa and are underlain by lacustrine sediments. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 813 to 864 mm (32 to 34 inches). Mean annual air temperature ranges from 10 to 11 degrees C (50 to 52 degrees F)."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the very poorly drained Sandusky, Lenawee, and Toledo soils. Lenawee and Toledo soils lack a mollic epipedon and formed in lacustrine sediments. They are on similar topographic positions on the lake plain but do not have the overlying calcareous material weathered from tufa. Sandusky soils are underlain by moderately fine textured lacustrine sediments at a depth of 51 to 102 cm (20 to 40 inches) and are further from the subterranean springs than Weyers soils."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND SATURATED HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY: Very poorly drained. The depth to the top of an intermittent perched high water table ranges from the surface to 15 cm (0.5 foot) between November and June in normal years. The potential for surface runoff is negligible. Saturated hydraulic conductivity is high in the tufa material and moderately low in the lacustrine material. Permeability is moderately rapid in the tufa material and moderately slow or slow in the lacustrine material."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: The 03/1999 revision moves the type location from Sandusky County, Ohio to Erie County, Ohio. Review of documentation from Sandusky and Erie County supports the redefinition of the series concept.\nWeyers soils do not have a calcic horizon because they are not enriched by secondary pedogenic carbonates. They have an irregular decrease in organic carbon but are not on flood plains and do not flood from stream overflow. The darker layers were buried by the accumulation of calcareous tufa. Weyers soils were formerly included with the Warners series.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nMollic epipedon: from the surface to a depth of 33 cm (Ap horizon).\nAquic conditions: from the surface to a depth of 203 cm.\nADDITIONAL DATA: Refer to the laboratory data and engineering test data for pedon SN-18 from The Ohio State University Soil Characterization Laboratory, Columbus, OH.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
