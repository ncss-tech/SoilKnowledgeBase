  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the solum ranges from 15 to 40 inches but is commonly less than 36 inches.  The argillic horizon is less than 10 inches thick.  One or two percent glauconite is in the sand fraction of some pedons.  The soil is strongly acid to extremely acid, unless limed.\nThe A horizon has a hue of 10YR, valules of 3 through 5 and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 4 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  It is fine sandy loam or very fine sandy loam.\nThe B horizon has hues of 7.5YR or 10YR, values of 4 through 6 and chroma of 6 through 8.  They are fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam or loamy fine sand.  Illuvial clay occurs as faint clay films in and around pores, on the upper surfaces of the peds and as clay bridges between sand grains.  Structure in the Bt horizon is weak or moderate.\nThe C horizon has hues of 10YR or 2.5Y,values of 5 through 7 and chroma of 4 through 8.  In some pedons it is variegated and streaked.  It is fine sand, loamy fine sand, or loamy very fine sand.\nCOMPETING SERIES  There are no other series in the same family as Westphalia.\nThe Downer, Galestown, Kenansville, Marr and Pennington are similar soils in related families.  They all have argillic horizons thicker than 10 inches, in addition, Downer soils have textures with higher contents of medium and coarse sand.  Galestown soils have B horizons of loamy sand or sand, Kenansville soils have thick sand or loamy sand surface horizons and average anual soil temperatures warmer than 59 degrees F, Marr soils have 18 to 35 percent clay in the argillic horizon, Pennington soils contain rock fragments throughout and have mixed mineralogy."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Westphalia soils formed in Coastal Plain sediments of unconsolidated very fine and fine sands of uniform grain size.  They are on uplands in the northern part of the inner Atlantic Coastal Plain.  Areas are smooth to dissected.  Slopes of 3 to 20 percent dominate but the slopes range from 0 to 50 percent.  The climate is temperate and humid.  Mean annual temperature is 45 to 57 degrees F., mean annual precipitation is 38 to 48 inches."

In Maryland, tobacco has been the most important crop with low to moderate yields but very good quality.  Native vegetation is red, white and black oaks, hickory, ash, locust, yellow poplar, holly and dogwood.  Stands of Virginia pine and red cedar occur in some former fields."
