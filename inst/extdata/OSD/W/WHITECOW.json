  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitecow series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in alluvium and colluvium from limestone.  These soils are on mountains, hills, alluvial fan remnants, and alluvial fans.  Slopes are 0 to 80 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 20 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
