    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Winz soils are on mountains. They typically occur on backslope positions on north aspects. These soils formed in colluvium and residuum from rhyodacitic tuff and other volcanic rocks.  Slopes are 8 to 50 percent.  Elevations range from 2,330 to 2,750 meters. The climate is moist subhumid with cold wet winters and warm dry summers. The mean annual precipitation is 450 to 700 mm. The mean annual temperature is 3 to 6 degrees C and the frost-free period is 40 to 60 days."
