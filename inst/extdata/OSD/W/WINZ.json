  "OVERVIEW": "The Winz series consists of very deep, well drained soils that formed in colluvium and residuum derived from rhyodacitic tuff and other volcanic rocks. Winz soils are on mountains. Slopes are 8 to 50 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 600 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 5 degrees C.",
