  "OVERVIEW": "The Wayan series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils that formed in loess influenced colluvium over residuum weathered from sedimentary rock. Wayan soils are on mountain slopes, swales and interfluves on mountain slopes. Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 560 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 2.0 degrees C.",
