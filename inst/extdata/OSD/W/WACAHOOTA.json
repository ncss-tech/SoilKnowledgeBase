  "REVDATE": "11/2018",
  "STATES": "FL",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wacahoota series consists of very deep, poorly drained, moderately permeable soils on side slopes of uplands on the Coastal Plain.  They formed in sandy and loamy marine sediments.  Near the type location, the mean annual temperature is about 72 degrees F., and the mean annual precipitation is about 59 inches.  Slopes range from 5 to 20 percent.",

  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness ranges from 60 to more than 80 inches.  In the solum, the content of weathered pebbles ranges from 5 to 25 percent, by volume.  There are a few cobbles in some pedons.  The content of ironstone pebbles, 2 to 20 mm in size, ranges from 0 to 5 percent.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid throughout except where the surface has been limed.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR, value 3 to 5, chroma 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 3 to 5.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 5 to 7, chroma 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Texture is sand, fine sand, loamy sand, loamy fine sand, or their gravelly analogs.\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 or less; or it is neutral with value of 5 to 7.  Iron accumulations in shades of yellow, brown, or red range from none to many.  Content of plinthite ranges from 0 to 5 percent, by volume.  Texture is sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam.  In some pedons, some parts of the Btg horizon may contain as much as 37 percent clay, but the weighted average clay content of the upper 20 inches of the B2tg horizon falls within the range for a loamy family.\nThe BCg horizon has the same range of colors as the Btg horizon.  Texture is sandy clay loam or gravelly sandy clay loam."

They formed in thick beds of sandy and loamy marine sediments.  The climate is humid subtropical.  The average annual precipitation ranges from 54 to 64 inches and the average annual air temperature ranges from about 71 to 73 degrees F."

All of these soils are on similar to slightly lower positions.  The very poorly drained Blichton soils have more than 5 percent plinthite in the subsoil and contain less that 5 percent gravel throughout.  Boardman soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers less than 20 inches in thickness.  Fellowship and Flemington soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers less than 20 inches in thickness and have clayey smectitic control sections.  Kanapaha soils have sandy surface and subsurface layers 40 to 80 inches in thickness.  The somewhat poorly drained Lochloosa and Sparr have less than 5 percent, by volume, pebbles throughout the profile."

Where water control is established, a few small areas are used for growing oranges, grapefruit, watermelons, and tomatoes.  Native vegetation consists of slash pine, loblolly pine, longleaf pine, water oak, hickory, and sweetgum, with an understory of wax myrtle, briars, and other native grasses and shrubs."

Formerly, they were a part of the Blichton series."
