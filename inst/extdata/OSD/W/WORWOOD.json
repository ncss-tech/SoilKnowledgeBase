    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to sandy outwash range from 24 to 40 inches.  Depth to the stratified lacustrine deposits ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle. Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent in the sandy outwash as a weighted average but ranges from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 2 percent in the lacustrine material.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Coarse fragments typically are absent in the stratified lacustrine deposit.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum but ranges to neutral in the A and E horizons, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the subsoil and from strongly acid to neutral in the 2C and 3C horizons.  Mottles are in the albic or spodic horizon within a depth of 20 inches and continue to 60 inches or more.  Aquic conditions occur within 20 inches at some time in most years.\nSome pedons have Oa or Oe horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs.\nSome pedons have a Bhs horizon with hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, or 7.5YR and value and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 4 to 6 or hue of 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 4.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs.\nThe E' horizon has color like the E horizon described above.  Texture commonly is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs, but in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nWorwood soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E' part has colors and textures like the E' horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 to 6.  Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs.\nThe Bt horizon has color and texture like the Bt part described above.\nSome pedons have a 2Bt or 2BC horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is loamy sand, sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 3 to 6.  Texture is sand, coarse sand, or the gravelly or very gravelly analogs.  Stratification is common.\nThe 3C horizon has hue of 5YR to 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 to 6.  Texture in individual strata is dominantly silt, silt loam, very fine sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loamy very fine sand, or very fine sand, but most pedons have thin strata of coarser or finer texture."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Belding, Moodig, Mudlake, Parkfalls, and Pesabicseries. Similar soils are the Oesterle and Worcester series. None of these soils except Oesterle and Worcester, have stratified sandy textures within the series control section.  Oesterle soils do not have a spodic horizon.  Worcester soils have an apparent water table and have more than 85 percent sand in the lower part of the series control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  These soils are in outwash-veneered areas of stream terraces and glacial lake plains.  Slopes range from 0 to 3 percent.  Worwood soils formed dominantly in loamy alluvium underlain by sandy outwash which is underlain by stratified lacustrine deposits. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 28 to 33 inches.  Mean annual air temperature ranges from 39 to 45 degrees F.  The frost free period ranges from about 90 to 120 days.  Elevation ranges from 700 to 1900 feet."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS:  These are the Minocqua, Padus, Padwood, Tipler, and Worcester soils.  The moderately well drained Padwood soils are in a drainage sequence with Worwood soils.  The well drained Padus soils, the moderately well drained Tipler soils, the somewhat poorly drained Worcester soils, and the poorly drained Minocqua soils form a drainage sequence in nearby areas where the substratum is sandy outwash to depths of more than 60 inches."

  "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY": {
    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained.  The potential for surface runoff ranges from negligible to low. Permeability is moderate in the loamy mantle, rapid or very rapid in the sandy substratum, and moderately slow in the stratified loamy and sandy substratum.  Worwood soils have a perched seasonal high water table at a depth of 0.5 to 2 feet at some time during the period September to June in most years."

  "USE AND VEGETATION": {
    "section": "USE AND VEGETATION",
    "content": "USE AND VEGETATION:  Most areas are used for woodland.  Native vegetation is red maple, sugar maple, yellow birch, balsam fir, paper birch, eastern hemlock, and quaking aspen.  A few areas have been cleared and are used for cropland or pastureland.  Common crops are corn, small grain, and hay."
