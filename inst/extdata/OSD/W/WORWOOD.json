  "OVERVIEW": "The Worwood series consists of very deep, somewhat poorly drained soils in outwash-veneered areas of stream terraces and glacial lake plains. They formed dominantly in moderately deep, loamy alluvium underlain by sandy outwash which is underlain by stratified lacustrine deposits. Permeability is moderate in the loamy mantle, rapid or very rapid in the sandy outwash, and moderately slow in the stratified loamy and sandy substratum.  Slope ranges from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 30 inches.  Mean annual air temperature is about 42 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of the loamy mantle and depth to sandy outwash range from 24 to 40 inches.  Depth to the stratified lacustrine deposits ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Volume of rock fragments averages less than 35 percent in the particle size control section.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 35 percent in the loamy mantle. Volume of gravel ranges from 3 to 45 percent in the sandy outwash as a weighted average but ranges from 0 to 60 percent in individual strata.  Volume of gravel ranges from 0 to 2 percent in the lacustrine material.  Volume of cobbles ranges from 0 to 5 percent throughout.  Coarse fragments typically are absent in the stratified lacustrine deposit.  Reaction typically ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid in the upper part of the solum but ranges to neutral in the A and E horizons, where the soil is limed.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid in the lower part of the subsoil and from strongly acid to neutral in the 2C and 3C horizons.  Mottles are in the albic or spodic horizon within a depth of 20 inches and continue to 60 inches or more.  Aquic conditions occur within 20 inches at some time in most years.\nSome pedons have Oa or Oe horizon with hue of 7.5YR or 10YR or the hue is neutral. Value is 2 or 3 and chroma is 0 to 3.\nThe A horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2.  Cultivated areas have an Ap horizon with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 3 or 4; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Texture is loam or sandy loam.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 4 to 6; and chroma of 2 or 3.  Colors of 4/3 or 5/3 have value dry of 7 or more.

Texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or the gravelly analogs.\nThe E' horizon has color like the E horizon described above.  Texture commonly is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or the gravelly analogs, but in some pedons it is loamy sand or gravelly loamy sand.\nWorwood soils have a glossic horizon (E/B or B/E horizons, or both). The E' part has colors and textures like the E' horizon described above. The Bt part has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, 10YR, 2.5Y, or 5Y; value of 4 or 5; and chroma of 2 to 6.
