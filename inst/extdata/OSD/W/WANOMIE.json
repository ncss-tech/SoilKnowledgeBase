  "OVERVIEW": "The Wanomie series consists of moderately deep to a duripan, well drained soils that formed on relict alluvial flats.  These soils formed in alluvium from mixed rock sources.  Slopes are 0 to 4 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 8 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 62 degrees F.",
