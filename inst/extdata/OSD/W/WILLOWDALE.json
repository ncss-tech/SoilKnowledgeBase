    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is estimated to range from 47 to 54 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry and are continuously dry in all parts between depths of 4  and 12 inches during the 3 month period following the summer solstice.  The mineralogy is mixed and contains 10 to 20 percent pumice sands.  The 10 to 40 inch control section 18 to 27 percent clay and more than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand.   Rock fragments are commonly absent in the control section but some pedons may have up to 20 percent.  Volcanic ash or pumice sand may occur in thin lenses throughout the solum.  The profiles are calcareous throughout but may be noncalcareous above 20 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 2 or 3 moist, 3 to 5 dry and chroma of 2 or 3 moist and dry.  It is loam or sandy loam with 0 to 19 percent gravel.\nThe ACk, and Bk horizon when present, has color similar to the A horizon.  It is loam, sandy loam, or gravelly sandy loam with 0 to 20 percent gravel.\nThe Ck horizon has value of 3 or 4 moist, 5 or 6 dry and chroma of 2 to 4 moist and dry.  It is fine sandy loam, sandy loam, silt loam, loam or sandy clay loam with 0 to 20 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Stratified very gravelly sand to extremely gravelly silt loam textures may occur below 40 inches.  Rock fragments range from 30 to 50 percent gravel and 0 to 15 percent cobbles."

Birdow soils lack horizons containing carbonates and ash. Blackrock soils are usually moist and contain 20 to 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. Coit soils are poorly drained.  Dagor soils lack carbonates.  Eastcan soil are moderately well drained and are mottled at 25 to 40 inches.  Goose Creek soils are moderately well to somewhat poorly drained and lack horizons containing carbonates and ash.  Goosenawt soils lack pumice sand within the particle-size control section.  Gosinta soils are moderately well drained and lack pumice sand. Lakeview soils are moderately well drained, are noncalcareous and have a cambic B horizon.  Monroe soils lack horizons containing carbonates and ash and have a surface layer 5 to 9 inches thick.  Oxy soils are moderately deep.  Shoepeg soils are somewhat poorly drained and lack pumice sand.  Soquel soils are noncalcareous and have a mean annual soil temperature of 56 to 58 degrees F."
