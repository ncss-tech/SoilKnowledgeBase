  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to sand and gravel is 20 to 40 inches.  Depth to the Cca horizon is 12 to 20 inches. Volume of gravel in the pedon above the very gravelly loamy sand C horizon ranges up to 30 percent.  The content of organic carbon in the upper 15 inches is 1 to 1.5 percent, and the weighted average sand/clay ratio is 1 to 2.  Wanetta soils are usually dry but their surfaces are moistened by occasional summer rains.  Mean annual soil temperature is 47 to 50 degrees F.  Virgin pedons have 2- to 4-inch thick loam A1 horizons and 3- to 5-inch thick loam A&B horizons.  The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, and chroma of 2 or 3.  The B2t horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry with coats of 4 or 5 and with chroma of 3 or 4.  It has 15 to 35 percent fine or coarser sand and 28 to 35 percent clay with an absolute increase of 5 to 10 percent clay over the Ap horizons and as much as 15 percent more clay than in the A1 horizons.  This horizon has moderate to strong prismatic and blocky structure."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

Larim soils have more than 35 percent gravel in their Bt horizons and they are 11 to 20 inches deep over sand and gravel.  Larimer soils have from 0.8 to 1 percent organic carbon in the upper 15 inches and they lack the increase in value from coated to rubbed soil in the A and B horizons.  Naturita soils have calcareous A and B horizons. Vernal soils have hue of 7.5YR or 5YR.  Yoder soils are noncalcareous."

The soils formed in calcareous alluvium of mixed mineralogy.  The climate is semiarid continental with 10 to 14 inches mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature of 44 to 48 degrees F., average July temperature of 73 degrees F., average January temperature of 22 degrees F. and a frost-free period of 110 to 140 days.  Seventy-five percent of the mean annual precipitation is distributed through the six-month period of April through September."
