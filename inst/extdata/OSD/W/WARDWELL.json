  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 53 degrees F.  The soils are usually dry but unless artificially drained they are saturated in a subhorizon between depths of 24 to 40 inches for a short period in late summer and have dominant chroma of 2 or less accompanied by mottles due to segregation of iron or manganese within depth of 40 inches.  Solum thickness is 16 to 30 inches and depth to moderately or slightly calcareous B3ca horizon is 12 to 20 inches.  Depth to loose sand and gravel is 20 to 40 inches.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3.  Any surface layer having value darker than 5.5 dry and 3.5 moist is less than 7 inches thick.  Texture is typically loam, but ranges to fine sandy loam.  Reaction is medium acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe B2t horizon is loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam.  It has weak or moderate prismatic or moderate strong subangular blocky structure.  This horizon averages 17 to 34 percent clay.  Reaction is slightly acid to mildly alkaline.\nThe C horizon is neutral to moderately alkaline."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wardwell soils are on low stream terraces and have slopes of 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in alluvium mainly from intrusive acid igneous rock sources.  Elevations are 2,000 to 2,500 feet.  The climate has hot, dry summers and cold, moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 8 to 12 inches.  The mean summer temperature is 70 to 72 degrees F., and the mean annual temperature is about 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost free season is about 145 to 170 days."

Emerson and Falk soils lack argillic horizons.  Letha soils have sodium saturation greater than 50 percent in the upper 20 inches.  Quenzer soils lack argillic horizons and are gleyed throughout the profile."
