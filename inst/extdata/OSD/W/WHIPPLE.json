The Gachado, Marbolite, and Vaiva soils are intermittently moist in some part of the soil moisture control section during July through September with Gachado soils being moist for more than 20 days cumulative in the soil moisture control section.In addition, Gachado soils are formed in alluvium from volcanic rocks. Marbolite soils are 36 to 50 centimeters to the lithic contact, while Vaiva soils have a paralithic contact on top of the lithic material."
