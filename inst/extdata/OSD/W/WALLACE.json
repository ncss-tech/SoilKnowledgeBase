  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 20 to 60 inches. Gravel content ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume throughout the pedon. Depth to the ortstein material ranges from 5 to 20 inches. Texture throughout the profile is sand or fine sand.\nSome pedons have A horizons up to 3 inches thick with hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 2 or 3; and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction of the A horizon is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe E horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 5 to 7; and chroma of 1 or 2. Reaction is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe Bhs and Bhsm horizons have hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 to 3. Reaction of the Bhs horizon ranges from very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bsm horizon has hue of 5YR or 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and chroma of 2 to 6. In some pedons the Bhsm occurs below the Bsm. Reaction is very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bs horizon, when present, has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 4 to 8. Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BC horizons have hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; and value and chroma of value of 4 to 6. Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe C horizon has hue of 5YR, 7.5YR, or 10YR; value of 5 or 6; and chroma of 4 to 6. It ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid."

The Borgstrom soil is saturated with water within 40 inches of the mineral surface for 1 month or more per year in 6 or more out of 10 years.  The closely related Garlic soil has 50 to 90 percent moderately to strongly cemented in the spodic horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Finch, Kalkaska, Rubicon, Spot and Tawas soils. The somewhat poorly drained Finch and poorly drained Spot and Roscommon soils are in lower landscape positions and form a drainage sequence with the Wallace soils. Kalkaska and Rubicon soils do not contain more than 50 percent ortstein and are on similar landscape positions. The organic Tawas soils are in adjacent depressions and drainageways."
