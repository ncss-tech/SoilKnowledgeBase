  "REVDATE": "04/2014",
  "STATES": "MT",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Woodhurst series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in colluvium over residuum derived from nonacid igneous rocks. These soils are on hills and mountains. Slopes are 8 to 40 percent. Mean annual precipitation is about 22 inches, and mean annual air temperature is about 40 degrees F.",
