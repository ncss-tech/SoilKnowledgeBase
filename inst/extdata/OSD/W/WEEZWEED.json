  "OVERVIEW": "The Weezweed series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils that formed in alluvium derived from pyroclastic volcanic rocks.  Weezweed soils are on stream terraces.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 8 degrees C.",
