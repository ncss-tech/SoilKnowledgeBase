Some pedons have a thin pale brown clay C horizon above the weathered bedrock. The weathered bedrock is usually tuff but unrelated very soft sandstone is in some pedons.\nParticle-size control section - Clay content: 45 to 60 percent clay.\nRock fragments:  5 to 15 percent, mainly tuffaceous gravel are throughout the profile.\nA horizon\nHue: 10YR or 7.5YR\nValue: 4 or 5 dry\nChroma: 2 or 3 dry, and 3 or 4 moist\nStructure: medium or coarse prismatic structure, but the immediate surface is fine granular in some pedons."

The soils formed in pedisediment and residuum derived from tuff.  The climate is semiarid, with hot dry summers and cold moist winters.  The mean annual temperature is 9 to 11 degrees C.  The mean annual precipitation is 200 to 300 mm.  The average frost-free season is about 100 days."
