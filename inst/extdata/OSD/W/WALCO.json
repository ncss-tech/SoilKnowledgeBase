  "OVERVIEW": "The Walco series consists of moderately deep, excessively  drained soils formed in eolian deposits.  Walco soils are on basalt plains and have slopes of 2 to 15 percent.  Permeability is rapid.  The average annual precipitation is about 10 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 50 degrees F.",
