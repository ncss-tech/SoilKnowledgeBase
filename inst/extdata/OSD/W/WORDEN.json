  "OVERVIEW": "The Worden series consists of somewhat poorly drained soils on glaciated uplands.  They formed in compact, loamy glacial till.  The soils are shallow or moderately deep to dense basal till and very deep to bedrock.  Permeability is moderate in the solum, and moderately slow or slow in the dense substratum. Slopes range from 3 to 25 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 50 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",

Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid in the solum, and from strongly acid through slightly acid in the Cd horizon.  Rock fragments are mostly pebbles and cobbles and range from 0 to 25 percent.  Depth to redoximorphic features is less than 20 inches. The Bh horizon is 4 or more inches thick and the combined thickness of the Bh, Bhs, or Bs horizon is 12 or more inches.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 3.  It is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 3.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It is 0 to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bh horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR.  It typically has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2, but higher values and chromas are allowed.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, and value and chroma of approximately 3 or less.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.\nThe B horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It is moderately or weakly smeary.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.  It has colors and textures are similar to the Bs horizon. It is 0 to 10 inches thick.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, in the fine-earth fraction.  It is massive or has moderate or strong, coarse or very coarse prismatic structure separating to weak or moderate, thick or very thick plates.  Consistence is firm or very firm.

The Colonel, Dixmont, Peru, Skerry, and Sunapee soils have a  Bh horizon 4 inches or less in thickness.  In addition the Dixmont and Sunapee soils do not have a dense basal till substratum and are moderately well drained.  The Mundal, Peru, and Skerry soils do not have redoximorphic features in an albic or spodic horizon within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface and are moderately well drained. Crary soils have a lithologic discontinuity and are moderately well drained.  Telos soils have a weighted average of more than 10 percent clay.\nThe Adirondak and Wilmington soils are in a related family.  The Adirondak soils have redoximorphic features in the spodic horizon.  The Wilmington soils have iron depletions in the upper part of the spodic and are poorly drained.\nThe competing series list is subject to change when THE KEYS TO SOIL TAXONOMY, 5th edition, 1992, are fully implemented."

The soils formed in compact, loamy glacial till of Wisconsin age that is derived mainly from schist or gneiss.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from about 60 to 120 days.  Elevation is typically between about 1500 to 2500 feet."

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS:  1. As originally proposed, the Worden series was classified as Thixotropic Cryic Fragiorthods.  Further study indicates the temperature regime of these soils is frigid.\n2. The Worden Series was reclassified to coarse-loamy, mixed, frigid Typic Epiaquods to conform with The Keys To Soil Taxonomy, 5th edition, 1992 in 11/93.  The change in classification was canceled 01/94 because of an incorrect interpretation of spodic materials (Bhs lacks spodic colors) and reclassified as Aquic Haplorthods.\n3. Albic horizons are often hard to locate because tree throws and other disturbances have destroyed the albic horizons in many areas of Worden soils.  When found, albic horizons are often thin, discontinuous, and located within 4 inches of the soil surface.\n4. The diagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\na. Ochric epipedon - the zone from 0 to 5 inches (Oi and A horizons).\nb. Spodic horizon - the zone from 5 to 13 inches (Bh, horizon).  Its assumed that the spodic horizon contains spodic materials as defined in The Keys To Soil Taxonomy, 5th edition, page 40, criteria 2b(2), 2b(3), or 2b(4). Some Bhs and Bs horizons will meet the criteria for a spodic horizon as defined in The Keys To Soil Taxonomy, 5th edition, page 22.\nc. Redoximorphic Features - masses of iron accumulation in the matrix from 13 to 68 inches; iron depletions in the matrix from 53 to 68 inches."
