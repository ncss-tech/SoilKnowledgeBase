    "section": "TYPE LOCATION",
    "content": "TYPE LOCATION:  Windham County, Vermont; Town of Dover, on Johnson Hill, 70 feet west of a logging road, and 0.6 mile north of the end of Maple Road.\n#RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The thickness of the solum ranges from 18 to 30 inches.  Depth to bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Reaction ranges from extremely acid through moderately acid in the solum, and from strongly acid through slightly acid in the Cd horizon.  Rock fragments are mostly pebbles and cobbles and range from 0 to 25 percent.  Depth to redoximorphic features is less than 20 inches. The Bh horizon is 4 or more inches thick and the combined thickness of the Bh, Bhs, or Bs horizon is 12 or more inches.\nThe A horizon is neutral or has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 3.  It is fine sandy loam, silt loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction.\nSome pedons have an E horizon that is neutral or has hue of 5YR through 10YR, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 0 through 3.  It is fine sandy loam or sandy loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It is 0 to 5 inches thick.\nThe Bh horizon is neutral or has hue of 2.5YR through 7.5YR.  It typically has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 0 through 2, but higher values and chromas are allowed.\nThe Bhs horizon has hue of 5YR through 10YR, and value and chroma of approximately 3 or less.\nThe Bs horizon has hue of 5YR through 2.5Y, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 4 through 6.\nThe B horizon is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam, or silt loam in the fine-earth fraction.  It is moderately or weakly smeary.\nSome pedons have a BC horizon.  It has colors and textures are similar to the Bs horizon. It is 0 to 10 inches thick.\nThe Cd horizon has hue of 7.5YR through 5Y, value of 4 through 6, and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, silt loam, fine sandy loam, or sandy loam, in the fine-earth fraction.  It is massive or has moderate or strong, coarse or very coarse prismatic structure separating to weak or moderate, thick or very thick plates.  Consistence is firm or very firm.  The lower part of the Cd horizon, below 40 inches, ranges from friable to firm."

    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  The Colonel, Crary, Dixmont, Mundal, Peru, Skerry, Sunapee, and Telos soils are in the same family.  The Colonel, Dixmont, Peru, Skerry, and Sunapee soils have a  Bh horizon 4 inches or less in thickness.  In addition the Dixmont and Sunapee soils do not have a dense basal till substratum and are moderately well drained.  The Mundal, Peru, and Skerry soils do not have redoximorphic features in an albic or spodic horizon within 20 inches of the mineral soil surface and are moderately well drained. Crary soils have a lithologic discontinuity and are moderately well drained.  Telos soils have a weighted average of more than 10 percent clay.\nThe Adirondak and Wilmington soils are in a related family.  The Adirondak soils have redoximorphic features in the spodic horizon.  The Wilmington soils have iron depletions in the upper part of the spodic and are poorly drained.\nThe competing series list is subject to change when THE KEYS TO SOIL TAXONOMY, 5th edition, 1992, are fully implemented."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  The Worden soils are on gently sloping to moderately steep foot slopes or toe slopes or in depressions on glaciated uplands.  Slopes range from 3 to  25 percent.  The soils formed in compact, loamy glacial till of Wisconsin age that is derived mainly from schist or gneiss.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 40 to 60 inches, and the mean annual temperature ranges from 38 to 44 degrees F.  The frost-free season ranges from about 60 to 120 days.  Elevation is typically between about 1500 to 2500 feet."
