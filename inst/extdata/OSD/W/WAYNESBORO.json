  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Thickness of solum and depth to bedrock are more than 60 inches.  The soil is strongly acid or very strongly acid except the surface layer where limed.  Each horizon contains 0 to 15 percent chert or  quartzite pebbles and sandstone cobbles, except the surface layer ranges to 25 percent.\nThe A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 2 or 3 and chroma of 1 or 2. The Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 3 to 8 or hue of 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 to 6.  The 7.5YR hue also has chroma of 2. value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 4 or 6.  The E horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 2 to 4.  The A, Ap and E horizons are sandy loam, fine sandy loam, loam or silt loam.  The Ap horizon is also clay loam in severely eroded areas.\nMany pedons have a transitional horizon between the A or E horizon and the Bt horizon.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 5YR or 2.5YR, value of 4 or 5 and chroma of 6 or 8.  In addition, the upper few inches includes hue of 7.5YR and the middle and lower parts also have hue of 2.5YR, value of 3 and chroma of 6.  Mottles are in shades of brown, yellow and red.  The Bt horizon is dominantly clay loam or clay, but ranges to sandy clay and the upper few inches ranges to sandy clay loam.  Clay content of the Bt horizon ranges from 35 to 50 percent, except the upper few inches ranges to about 28 percent in some pedons.  Sand content ranges from 20 to 50 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Dewey, Esto, Faceville, Fullerton, Henderson, Lugoff, Marlboro and Summerton series in the same family and the closely related Collegedale, Cumberland, Decatur and Dunmore series.  Dewey soils have less than 20 percent sand in the Bt horizon and have darker colors in the upper part of the pedon.  Esto, Lugoff and Marlboro have hues of 7.5YR and 10YR in the Bt horizon.  Faceville soils formed in coastal plain sediments and do not have dark red color in the Bt horizon.  Fullerton and Henderson soils contain 15 to 35 percent rock fragments.  Summerton soils formed in coastal plain sediments and have moderately slow permeability.  Collegedale soils have mixed mineralogy, have moderately slow or slow permeability and have less than 20 percent sand in the Bt horizon.  Cumberland and Decatur soils have value of 3 and are dominantly dark red in the upper 40 inches of the argillic horizon.  Cumberland also has more than 35 percent base saturation.  Dunmore soils are mesic and have less than 20 percent sand in the Bt horizon."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Waynesboro soils are on high terraces and uplands.  Topography is dominantly rolling and hilly but ranges from undulating to steep.  Slopes range from 2 to 30 percent.  These soils formed in old alluvium or unconsolidated material of sandstone, shale, and limestone origin 4 to 20 feet in thickness.    Near the type location, mean annual temperature is 59 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 50 inches."
