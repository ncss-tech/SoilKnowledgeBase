  "OVERVIEW": "The Wales series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium derived from sandstone, shale, limestone, and igneous rocks. Wales soils are on alluvial fans, alluvial flats, valley floors, drainageways, and floodplains. Slopes are 0 to 8 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 250 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
