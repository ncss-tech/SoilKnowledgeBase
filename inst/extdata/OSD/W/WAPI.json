  "OVERVIEW": "The Wapi series consists of shallow, excessively drained soils that formed in eolian sand and overlying basalt.  Wapi soils are on a basalt plain and have slopes of 0 to 20 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 200 millimeters and the mean annual temperature is about 11 degrees C.",

Most slopes are short and irregular due to frequent exposures of rock outcrops as knolls and ridges.  Elevations range from 1220 to 1340 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 175 to 230 millimeters.  The average annual temperature is 9 to 13 degrees C.  The frost free season is 110 to 130 days."
