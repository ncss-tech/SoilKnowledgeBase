    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 47 to 52 degrees F.  These soils are usually dry in all parts between a depth of 12 inches and the underlying bedrock.  Depth to basalt is less than 20 inches.  Rock fragments range from 0 to 5 percent angular pebbles and cobbles.  The soils are noncalcareous and neutral or mildly alkaline.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3, with less than 1 unit of value difference between surface and subsurface soil in any one pedon.  Organic matter is usually less than 1 percent.\nThe A and C horizons are loamy fine sand or fine sand."

Most slopes are short and irregular due to frequent exposures of rock outcrops as knolls and ridges.  Elevations range from 4,000 to 4,400 feet.  The mean annual precipitation is 7 to 9 inches.  The average annual temperature is 49 to 55 degrees F.  The frost free season is 110 to 130 days."
