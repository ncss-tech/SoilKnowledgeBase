  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Warshod series consists of deep, well drained soils formed in slope alluvium and residuum derived from sandstone and conglomerate. These soils are on terrace sideslopes, hillsides, and mountainsides. Slopes are 10 to 60 percent. Permeability is moderate. The average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual temperature is about 43 degrees F.",
