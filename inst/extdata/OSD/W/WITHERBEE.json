The A and E horizons are extremely acid to moderately acid and the Bh horizon is very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe A or Ap horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or neutral, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4.  A or Ap horizons with value of less than 3.5 are less than 6 inches thick.\nThe E horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 2 to 6, commonly with mottles in shades of brown, yellow, or gray.  It has chroma of 3 or more in some part of all pedons.\nThe Bh horizon has hue of 5YR to 10YR, or neutral, value of  2 to 4, and chroma of 0 to 4.  The Bh horizon does not turn redder on ignition.  The matrix of the upper 12 inches of the Bh horizon has less than .06 percent organic carbon.\nThe C horizon, where present, is more than 30 inches below the surface.  It has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 3 to 7, and chroma of 1 to 4."

Echaw, Kureb, Leon, Lynn Haven, Ridgeland, Rimini, and Seewee series are similar soils in other families.  Echaw and Rimini soils have A and E horizons more than 30 inches thick.  Kureb soils do not have a continuous Bh horizon.  Leon soils are poorly drained and have .06 percent or more organic carbon in the matrix of the upper 12 inches of the spodic horizon.  Lynn Haven soils have an umbric epipedon. Ridgeland and Seewee soils have mixed mineralogy, and in addition Ridgeland soils do not have an E horizon above the spodic horizon."
