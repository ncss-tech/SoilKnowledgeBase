  "OVERVIEW": "The Wagner series consists of very deep, poorly drained, very slowly permeable soils formed in alluvium or lacustrine sediments on stream terraces.  Slope gradients range from 0 to 3 percent.  Mean annual air temperature is about 53 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is about 36 inches.",

    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The depth to the base of the argillic horizon ranges from 36 to 60 inches.  The particle size control section ranges from 40 to 47 percent clay.\nThe upper one-fifth of the control section (A or Ap horizon) has value of 2 or 3, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to moderately alkaline.\nThe second one-fifth of the control section (Eg horizon) has value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It contains mottles with higher chroma.  It is silt loam.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe next two-fifths of the control section (Btg and BCg horizons) have properties as follows:\nThe Btg horizon has hue of 10YR, 2.5Y or 5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 1 or 2.  It contains mottles with higher chroma.  It is silty clay or silty clay loam.  Average clay content ranges from contains 40 to 47 percent and individual subhorizons range from 38 to 50 percent clay.  Reaction ranges from very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe BCg horizon has colors like the Btg horizon.  Average clay content ranges from 36 to 42 percent.  In some pedons it has very thin strata of very fine sand to silt loam.  Reaction ranges from strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe lower one-fifth of the control section (Cg horizon) has colors like the Btg horizon.  It is dominantly silty clay loam and averages between 32 and 38 percent clay.  Strata of well sorted material have sand contents that range from 1 percent to 90 percent."

Appanoose, Chariton, and Putnam soils average more than 47 percent clay in the particle size control section.  Belinda soils have the base of the argillic horizon extending to more than 60 inches.  Brooklyn soils average less than 32 percent clay in the lowest part of the control section.  Cisne and Glensted soils average more than 1 percent coarse fragments in the lower one-fourth to one-half of the control section.  Cowden, Denny, and Rubio soils do not have strata in the lowest part of the control section with as much as 90 percent sand.  Holcomb soils have an umbric epipedon."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Wagner soils are on terrace treads.  Slopes most commonly are 0 to 1 percent and range from 0 to 3 percent.  They formed in slackwater alluvium or lacustrine sediments mostly of silty clay loam textures.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 36 and 42 inches, mean annual air temperature ranges from 52 and 56 degrees F., frost free days range from 170 to 200, and elevation ranges from 340 to 680 feet above sea level."

The Beaucoup, Darwin, and Tice soils have mollic epipedons and are on flood plains nearby.  Okaw soils have light surface layers and are in similar positions on nearby terraces.  Racoon soils have thicker A horizons, lack the abrupt transitions into the argillic horizon, and are fine-silty and are in similar positions nearby."
