  "OVERVIEW": "The Wassit series consists of very shallow and shallow, well drained soils that formed in residuum and colluvium derived from volcanic rocks and influenced by eolian volcanic ash.  Wassit soils are on hills and mountains.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  The mean annual precipitation is about 300 mm and the mean annual temperature is about 7 degrees C.",
