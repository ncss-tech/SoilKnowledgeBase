The probable sources of the volcanic ash are the Mono Craters and Long Valley Caldera in eastern California.  Slopes are 15 to 75 percent.  Elevations range from 1,640 to 2,740 meters.  The mean annual precipitation is 250 to 350 mm, the mean annual temperature is 4 to 7 degrees C, and the frost-free period is 80 to 110 days."

    "content": "REMARKS:  The revision of October 2002 updates the taxonomic class, from Loamy-skeletal, mixed, frigid Lithic Mollic Haploxeralfs, because of a change in concept for moisture regime.\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon are:\nOchric epipedon - The zone from the soil surface to 15 cm (A1 and A2 horizons).\nArgillic horizon - The zone from 15 to 30 cm (Bt1 and Bt2 horizons).\nVitrandic intergrade properties - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (A1, A2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nLithic contact - The boundary at 30 cm to underlying hard, unweathered bedrock (R layer).\nParticle-size control section - The zone from the soil surface to 30 cm (A1, A2, Bt1, and Bt2 horizons).\nADDITIONAL DATA:  A pedon similar to Wassit, but higher in volcanic glass, has full characterization by the Soil Survey Laboratory (SSL), Lincoln, NE, as soil survey sample number S82NV-021-008 (pedon # 82P0629).\nUser Pedon ID: 2007NV0211156.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
