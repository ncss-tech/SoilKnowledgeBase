  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Solum thickness range from 30 to 55 inches.  Depth to hard bedrock is greater than 60 inches.  Depth to soft bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Rock fragments of quartzite gravel and flagstone range from 35 to 70 percent.  Up to 15 percent on the soil surface is covered with stones and boulders.  This soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 3.  The A horizon is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 3 through 6.  The E horizon is loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt and 2Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  Highly weathered parent material in shades of red, yellow, brown, and white is common in the lower horizon.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C and 2C horizons, where present, are multicolored in shades of red, yellow, brown and white.  The Cr is similar in color to the C and is interbedded quartzite and partially weathered quartz muscovite schist.  It is sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Croom, Elliber, Gainesboro, Hartleton, Irondale, Lew, Mertz and Pattenburg soils.  The Croom soils are formed in stratified gravelly Coastal Plain sediments.  Elliber soils are formed in residuum from cherty limestone.  Gainesboro soils are in residuum from acid red shale, fine grained sandstone and silt stone.  Bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Hartleton soils are formed in glacial till derived from sandstone and shale and bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Irondale soils are in silty residuum from rhyolite bedrock and solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Lew soils formed in colluvium from metabasalt greenstone.  Mertz soils formed in colluvium from cherty limestones.  Pattenburg soils are in residuum from Triassic conglomerate and have quartzite gravel and cobblestones in the solum."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Weverton soils are on ridges and backslopes of the northern portion of the Blue Ridge Anticlinorium.  These soils developed in slope creep and residuum that weathered from interbedded quartz muscovite schist and phyllite.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 35 to 42 inches, and mean annual temperature ranges from 50 to 56 degrees F."

On the lower mountain slopes they are associated with the Braddock, Thurmont and Trego soils.  The Airmont and Trego soils have a fragipan layer in the subsoil.  The Stumpton soils are less than 40 inches to bedrock.  The Braddock and Thurmont soils have less than 35 percent rock fragments."
