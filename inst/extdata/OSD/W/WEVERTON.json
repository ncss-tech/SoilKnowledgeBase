  "OVERVIEW": "Soils of the Weverton series are deep, well drained with moderate permeability.  They formed partly in slope creep and partly in residuum that weathered from interbedded quartzite, quartz muscovite schist, and phyllite of the Blue Ridge Anticlinorium.  Slopes range from 2 to 50 percent.  Mean annual precipitation is about 40 inches, and mean annual temperature is about 53 degrees F.",

Rock fragments of quartzite gravel and flagstone range from 35 to 70 percent.  Up to 15 percent on the soil surface is covered with stones and boulders.  This soil is very strongly acid or strongly acid.\nThe A horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR value of 3 through 5 and chroma of 1 through 3.  The A horizon is loam, silt loam, or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe E horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 7 and chroma of 3 through 6.  The E horizon is loam or sandy loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe Bt and 2Bt horizons have hue of 2.5YR, 5YR, 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 4 through 6 and chroma of 4 through 8.  Highly weathered parent material in shades of red, yellow, brown, and white is common in the lower horizon.  It is loam, silt loam, sandy clay loam or clay loam in the fine earth fraction.\nThe C and 2C horizons, where present, are multicolored in shades of red, yellow, brown and white.  The Cr is similar in color to the C and is interbedded quartzite and partially weathered quartz muscovite schist.  It is sandy loam, loam or silt loam in the fine earth fraction."

The Croom soils are formed in stratified gravelly Coastal Plain sediments.  Elliber soils are formed in residuum from cherty limestone.  Gainesboro soils are in residuum from acid red shale, fine grained sandstone and silt stone.  Bedrock ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Hartleton soils are formed in glacial till derived from sandstone and shale and bedrock ranges from 40 to 60 inches.  Irondale soils are in silty residuum from rhyolite bedrock and solum thickness ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  Lew soils formed in colluvium from metabasalt greenstone.  Mertz soils formed in colluvium from cherty limestones.  Pattenburg soils are in residuum from Triassic conglomerate and have quartzite gravel and cobblestones in the solum."
