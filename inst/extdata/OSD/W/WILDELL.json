The weighted average of the rock fragments in the control section is greater than 35 percent by volume.\nSoil Reaction: Ultra acid to very strongly acid, unless limed.\nOther Soil Features:  In most pedons, the horizons in the upper part of the solum have been mixed by tree throws, soil creep, or a combination of these processes. The upper solum commonly contains mixed or combined horizons and horizons with broken or irregular boundaries. Rarely are horizons in the upper solum homogeneous. Therefore, the properties described in the Range of Individual Horizons can and should be applied to discrete parts of intermingled horizons.\nRange of Individual Horizons:\nO horizon: An organic horizon in various stages of decomposition is present. This horizon is mainly derived from the leaf litter of red spruce and/or eastern hemlock trees. Combined thickness of the O horizon is 3 to 41 cm (1 to 16 inches).\nA horizon (if present):\nColor--hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 1 to 3.\nTexture (fine-earth fraction)- silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, or clay loam.\nOther features-this horizon may be highly organic\nE  horizon:\nColor--hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 2 or 3.\nTexture (fine-earth fraction)-silt loam, silty clay loam, loam, clay loam, or fine sandy loam.\nOther features- structure is commonly moderate medium subangular blocky.

  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Wildell soils were previously mapped as moist phases of the Berks or Dekalb soil series in out-of-date soil surveys in West Virginia. Wildell soils are found on cool, moist landscapes. They have a perudic or near-perudic soil moisture regime and a frigid soil temperature regime. Although some areas of these soils are currently covered by northern hardwood forests, they are thought to have formed under a canopy that was at least 50 percent conifer (red spruce and/or eastern hemlock).\nDiagnostic horizons and soil characteristics recognized in this pedon are:\nFolistic epipedon--the zone from 0 to 23 centimeters (0 to 9 inches) (Oi, Oe, Oa horizons).\nSpodic horizon--the zone from 29 to 50 cm (Bhs/Bh and Bs/Bhs horizons).\nSkeletal feature--Approximately 39 percent (by volume) weighted average rock fragments in the 25 to 98 centimeters (10 to 39 inches) control section.\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 98 centimeters (0 to 39 inches)."
