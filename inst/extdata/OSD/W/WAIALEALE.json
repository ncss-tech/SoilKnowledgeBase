  "OVERVIEW": "The Waialeale series consists of moderately deep, somewhat poorly drained soils that formed in material weathered from basic igneous rock.  Waialeale soils are on high uplands and have slopes of 30 to 70 percent.  The mean annual rainfall is about 175 inches and the mean annual temperature is about 56 degrees F.",
