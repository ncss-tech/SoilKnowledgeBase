  "REMARKS": {
    "section": "REMARKS",
    "content": "REMARKS: Westfield soils were previously mapped with the Pacolet and Bethlehem series. Pacolet soils are thermic and are very deep to bedrock. Bethlehem soils are thermic and are moderately deep to paralithic contact. The April 1997 relocation of the mesic/thermic line necessitated the establishment of the Fairview series (mesic counterpart to the Pacolet series), and the Woolwine series (mesic counterpart to the Bethlehem series).\nDiagnostic horizons and features recognized in this pedon:\nOchric epipedon--the zone from the surface of the soil to a depth of 9 inches (Ap horizon)\nArgillic horizon--the zone from 13 to 28 inches (Bt horizon)\nKandic horizon--the zone from 13 to 35 inches (Bt and BC horizons)\nParalithic contact--bedrock contact at a depth of 48 inches (upper boundary of the Cr layer)\nParalithic materials--the zone from 48 to 60 inches (Cr horizon)\nOther soil features identified with this pedon:\nSeries control section--the zone from 0 to 58 inches\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nLaboratory Data: No laboratory data available. Data from the nearby Fairview and Woolwine series sites, support the kandic diagnostic horizon and kaolinitic mineralogy. Data from a pedon in Patrick County, Virginia that meets the physical properties for this series had a CEC 7.0/clay ratio of 15.\nDatabase Information:\nTypical Pedon Data Mapunit ID--82681\nTABULAR SERIES DATA:\nSoi-5  Soil Name  Slope  Airtemp  FrFr/Seas  Precip  Elevation\nNC0281 WESTFIELD  2-60   52-57    160-205    40-55   300-1400\nNC0191 WESTFIELD  2-60   52-57    160-205    40-55   300-1400\nSOI-5  FloodL FloodH Watertable Kind   Months  Bedrock Hardness\nNONE          >6.0       -      -       40-60   SOFT\nSOI-5  Depth  Texture                3-Inch  No-10   Clay%   -CEC-\nNC0281  0- 9  SL L                    0-5   80-100   7-20   2-7\nNC0191  0- 9  GR-SL GRV-SL GR-SCL     0-20  35-76    7-35   2-10\nNC0191  0- 9  CB-SL                  15-30  45-80    7-20   2-7\nNC0191  9-13  SCL GR-SCL              0-20  50-100  20-35   4-8\nNC0191 13-35  C CL GR-C GR-CL         0-10  60-100  35-60   7-12\nNC0191 35-48  GR-SCL L                0-20  30-85   20-35   4-8\nNC0191 48-60  WB                       -      -       -      -\nSOI-5  Depth   -pH-     O.M.
