    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Thickness of the mantle and depth to friable till ranges from 0 to 41 cm. The depth to dense till ranges from 152 to 203 cm. Depth to free carbonates is greater than 203 cm.  Volume of rock fragments throughout the upper mantle and fine loamy till ranges from 1 to 12 percent with 1 to 10 percent gravel, 0 to 1 percent cobbles, and 0 to 1 percent stones and boulders. Rock fragment content in the dense till ranges from 8 to 25 percent with 8 to 25 percent gravel, 0 to 10 percent cobbles and 0 to 5 percent stones and boulders. The mantle averages less than 18 percent clay. The friable till ranges from 16 to 22 percent clay and contains less than 45 percent sand.  The dense till ranges from 3 to 10 percent clay and contains less than 72 percent sand.\nSome pedons have an O horizon (duff layer).\nThe A horizon have a hue of 5YR to 10YR or is neutral, value of 2 to 3, and a chroma of 0 to 2. It is silt loam, loam, or their mucky analogues. They are very strongly acid to moderately acid.\nThe Bw or Bg horizons have a hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 3 to 5, and a chroma of 2 to 4. These horizons have many or common, distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. They are loam or silt loam. They are very strongly acid to slightly acid.\nThe 2BC horizon, when present, has a hue of 5YR to 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, and chroma of 3 or 4. This horizon has distinct or prominent redoximorphic features. It is loam or silt loam. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral.\nThe 2BCd horizon has a hue of 2.5YR or 5YR and value and chroma of 3 or 4. It is sandy loam, fine sandy loam or their gravelly analogues.  It is moderately acid to neutral."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: These soils have plane or concave slopes of 0 to 1 percent.  They are in depressions on moraines. This soil formed in a discontinuous mantle of eolian or water laid sediments and the underlying friable till and the underlying dense till. The till is from the Superior Lobe of the Late Wisconsinan glaciation. Mean annual air temperature ranges from 4 to 7 degrees C.  Mean annual precipitation ranges from 625 to 750 mm.  The frost free season ranges from 120 to 140 days. The elevation ranges from 300 to 500 meters above sea level."

The poorly drained Eldes soil occurs on plane, concave or toeslope positions. The well drained Forbay soil occurs on shoulders and backslopes. The somewhat poorly drained Hegberg soil occurs on footslopes and summits."

Saturated hydraulic conductivity is 4.23 to 42.34 micrometers per second (0.60 to 6 inches per hour) in the upper mantle, 1.41 to 14.11 micrometers per second (0.20 to 2.0 inches per hour) in the middle part and .01 to .042 micrometers per second (0.0015 to 0.006 inches per hour) in the lower part. The Wahbegon soils have seasonal high saturation at the surface during spring and fall in normal years.  In addition, ponding can occur during periods of snow melt and heavy rainfall."

(Bw horizons); densic contact - 152 cm (2BCd horizon).\nThe designation of the 3BCd horizon is based on fractures and platy structure in the densic material.  Clay and silt translocation can be seen between the horizontal plates when broken apart.\nThis reddish parent material does not show low chroma colors typical of reducing conditions.\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
