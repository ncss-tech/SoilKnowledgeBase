  "OVERVIEW": "The Wilma series consists of moderately deep, well drained soils formed in residuum and colluvium weathered from granitic rocks with a thin mantle of volcanicash.  Wilma soils are on ridge crests, backslopes, shoulders, and spur ridges on mountain sideslopes that usually have a southerly aspect at elevations from 2,400 to 5,800 feet.  Slopes range from 15 to 60 percent.  The average annual precipitation is about 28 inches and the average annual temperature is about 45 degrees F.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to diagnostic horizons and features are measured from the top of the first mineral layer.  The average annual soil temperature ranges from 44 to 46 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 60 to 90 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  Depth to lithic contact ranges from 20 to 40 inches.  The upper 10 to 14 inches of this soil has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.70 to 0.90 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples.  Rock fragments in the particle-size control section average 35 to 65 percent.  Pararock fragment content ranges from 15 to 50 percent in the lower part of the control section and 0 to 5 percent in the upper part.  Reaction is slightly acid or neutral throughout.  Some pedons have an O horizon of undecomposed organic matter.\nThe A horizon has value of 4 to 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 moist or dry.  Surface stones and boulders range from 1 to 3 percent.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 7.5YR or 10YR, value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 to 5 moist, and chroma of 2 to 4 moist or dry.  Textures are gravelly ashy sandy loam, gravelly ashy fine sandy loam, or very gravelly ashy sandy loam.  Angular granitic rock fragments range from 15 to 40 percent.\nThe 2BC horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 or 6 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist or dry.  Texture is very gravelly or very cobbly fine sandy loam or very gravelly sandy loam.  Angular granitic rock fragments range from 40 to 60 percent.  Paragravel content range from 5 to 20 percent. Some pedons lack a BC horizon.\nThe 2C horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y, value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 through 6 moist or dry.  Texture is very gravelly or extremely gravelly loamy sand, very gravelly coarse sandy loam, very cobbly coarse sandy loam, or very gravelly sandy loam.  Angular granitic rock fragments range from 35 to 60 percent by volume.  Paragravel content ranges from 15 to 50 percent."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Kloochman, McCree, Newhorn, Redriver, and Veridge soils.  Kloochman soils are dominated by gneiss or schist channers and flags in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  McCree soils are more than 40 inches deep.  Newhorn soils have compact till at 20 to 40 inches.  Redriver soils are dry for 90 consecutive days and have 50 to 75 percent basalt rock fragments.  Veridge soils are over sandstone and lack the coarse sand in the substratum.  Soils that have not been updated in the new classificaiton include the Belzar, Hartill, Inkler, Newbell, Ohscow, Oxerine, Talls, Threemile, and Wilmont series.  Belzar soils are slightly alkaline or moderately alkaline and are effervescent in the 2C horizon within the particle-size control section.  Hartill soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Inkler, Newbell, Ohscow, Talls, Threemile, and Wilmont soils are more than 40 inches deep.  Oxerine soils are dominated by flags and channers in the particle-size control section.  Soils with the similar isotic mineralogy include the Inkler, Juandefuca, and Tunnelcreek series.  Inkler and Juandefuca soils are greater than 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Tunnelcreek soils are dry for 45 to 60 consecutive days and have 15-bar moisture content of more than 12 percent in the ash mantle (medial)."
