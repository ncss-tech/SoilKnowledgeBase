  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness and depth to serpentinite bedrock range from 25 to 50 centimeters. Rock fragments range from 0 to 85 percent by volume with a weighted average of more than 35 percent rock fragments in the control section. The soil texture is sandy loam, fine sandy loam, or loam in the fine-earth fraction. The soil reaction ranges from moderately acid to slightly alkaline.\nThe Ap, A, or AB horizon has hue of 5YR to 2.5Y, value of 2 to 4, and chroma of 2 or 3. It has weak to strong granular structure. Consistence is very friable or friable.\nThe Bw horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 2.5Y, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 3 to 6. It has moderate subangular blocky structure. Consistence is friable.\nSome pedons have a C horizon with similar color, texture, and consistence to the Bw horizon. It is structureless and massive.\nThe 2R horizon is light green to dark green serpentinite.  Some pedons have a 2Cr horizon consisting of weathered serpentinite bedrock with a lower hardness value than the underling 2R horizon."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wotalf soils are nearly level to very steep soils on serpentinite bedrock-controlled ridges and hills on glaciated uplands. They developed in a thin mantle of supraglacial melt-out till of Wisconsinan age mainly derived from serpentinite and red acid sandstone, siltstone, and/or shale. Slope ranges from 0 to 75 percent. The climate is humid and temperate. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 1011 to 1283 millimeters, and mean annual temperature ranges from 8 to 17 degrees Celsius. The frost-free period is 210 to 235 days."

  "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS": {

    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the Boonton, Branford, Cheshire, Haledon, Hasbrouck, Ludlow, Manchester, Penwood, Todthill, Wethersfield, and Wilbraham soils. Boonton, Haledon, and Hasbrouck soils formed in till derived from red sedimentary rocks and basalt and contain argillic horizons and fragipan restrictions.  Cheshire soils formed in melt-out till derived from red sedimentary rock and/or basalt and are very deep to bedrock. Branford, Manchester and Penwood soils form in glaciofluvial deposits derived from red sedimentary rocks and/or basalt. Ludlow, Wethersfield and Wilbraham soils developed in lodgment till derived from red sedimentary rocks and/or basalt. Todthill soils formed in the same parent materials as Wotalf and are moderately deep to serpentinite bedrock."

Dominant native vegetation includes little bluestem, Indiangrass, winged sumac, northern bayberry, tulip tree, and oak.  Non-native vegetation includes common wormwood, honeysuckle, oriental bittersweet, black locust, and tree of heaven."
