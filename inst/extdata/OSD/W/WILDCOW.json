(Bt horizon)\nMollic epipedon:  The zone from 1 to 16 inches.  (A horizon)\nArgillic horizon:  The zone from 16 to 29 inches.  (Bt horizon)\nThis soil is located at elevations transitioning from Typic Ustic to Udic soil moisture regimes.  At these elevations Typic Ustic plant communities are observed on southerly aspects and Udic plant communities are observed on northerly aspects.  Wildcow soils are found predominantly on northerly aspects and has been correlated to High Mountain range sites and Udic moisture regime.\nThe cation exchange activity class was inferred from laboratory data in the Uintah Area Soil Survey.\nThe classification was changed from Argic Cryoborolls to Typic Argicryolls 12/98.\nTaxonomic version:  Eighth Edition, 1998.\nADDITIONAL DATA:\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
