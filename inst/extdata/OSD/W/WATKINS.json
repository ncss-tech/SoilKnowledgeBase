  "OVERVIEW": "The Watkins series consists of very deep, well drained soils formed in alluvium. These soils are on treads and risers on stream terraces. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. Mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C (49 degrees F). Mean annual precipitation is about 84 centimeters (33 inches).",
