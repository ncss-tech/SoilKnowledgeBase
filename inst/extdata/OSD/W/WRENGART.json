  "REVDATE": "02/2003",
  "STATES": "MO",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Wrengart series consists of very deep, moderately well drained soils on uplands. Permeability is moderately slow. These soils formed in loess and residuum from cherty limestone. Slopes range from 2 to 35 percent. Mean annual temperature is 55 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation is 38 inches.",

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  Depth to the top of a brittle horizon (2Btx) is 20 to 44 inches. The depth to the top of the subhorizons with more than 15 percent gravel (2Btx or 3Bt) is 40 to 60 inches. In some pedons the brittle horizons extend to depths of 60 inches or more. The depth to the base of the argillic horizon is 80 inches or more. Rock fragments average 35 to 75 percent in the third one-fourth of the control section. Some subhorizons have as much as 90 percent. The bottom one-fourth of the control section can have from 5 to 90 percent rock fragments.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR, value of 3 to 5 and chroma of 2 to 4. Dry value is 6 or more. Reaction is moderately acid to neutral. The E horizon, where present has value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 or 4.\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 3 to 6 in the upper part, but may be 2 chroma in the lower part. It is silty clay loam or silt loam. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe brittle horizon (2Btx) has hue of 10YR or 7.5YR, value of 4 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6. It typically is silt loam, loam, or silty clay loam. It is brittle in 30 to 60 percent of the mass. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 2Bt and 3Btx horizon, where present, has hue of 10YR to 2.5YR, value of 3 to 6 and chroma of 2 to 6. It is silt loam, silty clay loam, clay loam, loam, or their gravelly, very gravelly or extremely gravelly analogues. Reaction is very strongly acid to neutral.\nThe 3Bt or 4Bt horizon has hue of 2.5YR to 10YR, value of 3 to 8 and chroma of 2 to 8. It is silty clay loam, silty clay, or clay or their gravelly, very gravelly, extremely gravelly, cobbly, very cobbly, or extremely cobbly analogues. Reaction is strongly acid to moderately alkaline."

These soils formed in loess and residuum from cherty limestone. With increasing slope, depth to the 3Bt horizon decreases. The mean annual temperature ranges from 54 to 58 degrees F., and mean annual precipitation ranges from 34 to 40 inches."

Cotton soils have more clay in the subsoil and are on higher more stable summits. Goss soils are clayey-skeletal and are on lower slopes. Weingarten soils are well drained and are on similar positions."
