Flanly soils are 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact and are formed in granodiorite. Millvilla soils are 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact and are formed in metasedimentary rock. Motherlode soils are 100 to 150 cm to a lithic contact and are formed in metavolcanic rock. Sierra soils are greater than 150 cm to a root-restrictive bedrock contact and are formed in granodiorite. Thompsonflat soils are 100 to 150 cm to a duripan and have well rounded gravel in the lower part. Verjeles soils are 50 to 100 cm to a paralithic contact and are formed in intrusive basic igneous rock. Yellowlark soils are 100 to 150 cm to a duripan and are formed in alluvium."
