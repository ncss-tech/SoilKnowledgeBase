    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean  annual soil temperature is 37 to 41 degrees F.  These soils are usually moist, but are dry in all parts of the moisture control section for 45 to 60 consecutive days following the summer solstice.  The solum (A and Bw horizons) has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.60 to 0.85 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 60 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 1.0 to 2.0 percent, 15-bar water retention of 5 to 12 percent for air dried samples, and 10 to 40 percent pumice paragravel.  The particle-size control section has 0 to 25 percent rock fragments.  Reaction is slightly acid to neutral.  Depth to loamy or loamy-skeletal 2C horizon is 40 to over 60 inches.  Depth to the BC horizon is 30 to 50 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  The texture is ashy sandy loam or ashy coarse sandy loam, and can be paragravelly or very paragravelly.  There is 10 to 40 percent pumice and 0 to 10 percent gravel.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 5 to 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 day and moist.  It is ashy sandy loam or ashy coarse sandy loam and is paragravelly or very paragravelly with 15 to 40 percent pumice paragravel.\nThe BC horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  It is ashy sandy loam or ashy loamy coarse sand and is gravelly or very gravelly with 25 to 55 percent gravel and 0 to 5 percent cobbles.  Moist bulk density and glass content is the same as the A and Bw horizon but the acid oxalate aluminum plus one-half the acid oxalate iron is 0.4 to 1.0 percent.\nThe 2C horizon has value of 6 or 7 dry, 4 or 5 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry and moist.  The texture is sandy loam or coarse sandy loam.  It can be very gravelly, very cobbly, gravelly, or cobbly.  There is 10 to 30 percent gravel, 0 to 25 percent cobbles, and 0 to 15 percent stones."

Kittleson, Goffpeak and Shroyton soils are 40 to 60 inches deep to bedrock.  Steiger soils have less than 5 percent clay throughout the profile, lack a cambic horizon and have 70 to 100 percent glass and have 0.4 to 0.9 percent oxalate values.  Sycan soils have redox concentrations below 40 inches."

Slopes are 15 to 65 percent.  The climate is characterized by cool, dry summers and cold, wet winters.  Average annual precipitation is 25 to 40 inches.  The average January temperature ranges from 18 to 22 degrees F., and the average July temperature is 52 to 58 degrees F.  Average annual temperature ranges from 37 to 41 degrees F.
