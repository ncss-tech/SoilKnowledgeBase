  "OVERVIEW": "The Wuksachi series consists of very deep, very poorly drained soils formed in organic material over alluvium derived from granitic rocks. The Wuksachi soils are on flood plains and low flood-plain steps of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Slopes range from 0 to 5 percent. The mean annual precipitation is about 1080 mm and the mean annual air temperature is about 9 degrees C.",
