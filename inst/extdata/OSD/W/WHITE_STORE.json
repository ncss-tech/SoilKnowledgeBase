  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES:  These are the Iredell and Polkton series in the same family.  Iredell soils formed in material weathered from diabase, diorite, gabbro, and other rocks high in ferro-magnesium minerals.  Polkton soils have a depth to paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches.  Soils in closely related or similar families are the Creedmoor, Enon, Green Level, Helena, Iredell, Pittsboro, and Vance series.  Creedmoor soils are very deep, have less than 35 percent base saturation, and have redoximorphic depletions within the upper 24 inches of the argillic horizon.  Enon soils are very deep and well drained.  Helena and Vance soils have less than 35 percent base saturation and are very deep.  Green Level has less than 35 percent base saturation and has redoximorphic depletions in the upper 24 inches of the argillic.  Pittsboro soils have a paralithic contact at 20 to 40 inches."
