  "STATES": "ID",
  "OVERVIEW": "The Whitetop series consists of shallow, well drained soils formed in residuum from weakly consolidated ash.  These soils are on shoulders, summits, and upper backslopes of hills.  Permeability is moderately rapid.  Slopes range from 8 to 45 percent.  Average annual precipitation is about 16 inches and the average annual air temperature is about 41 degrees F.",
