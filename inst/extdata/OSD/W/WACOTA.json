These soils are dry in all parts between 4 and 12 inches more than half the time the soil temperature is more than 40 degrees F, about 105 to 120 days from about May 1, to October 1.  The upper part of the 10 to 40 inch particle-size control section has an estimated moist bulk density of 0.85 to 1.10 g/cc, volcanic glass content of 30 to 50 percent, acid-oxalate extractable aluminum plus one-half of the acid-oxalate extractable iron of 0.10 to 0.30 percent, and 15-bar water retention of 5 to 10 percent for air dried samples.  The lower part of the particle-size control section has less than 15 percent coarser than very fine sand (coarse-silty).  The layer of ashy material is from the surface to a depth of 14 to 36 inches.  Depth to carbonates is 30 to 60 inches.\nThe A horizon has value of 3, 4 or 5 moist, 5, 6 or 7 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  Reaction is neutral or slightly alkaline.\nThe Bw horizon has value of 3 to 6 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 3 moist and dry.  It is ashy silt loam or ashy very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bw2 horizon has value of 5 or 6 dry, 3 or 4 moist, and chroma of 2 or 3 dry or moist.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  It is neutral to moderately alkaline.\nThe 2Bk horizon has value of 4 to 7 moist, 5 to 8 dry, and chroma of 1 to 4 moist and dry.  It is silt loam or very fine sandy loam.  Reaction is slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline."

All soils contain less than 30 percent volcanic ash in all parts.  In addition, the Kennewick and Stingal soils are calcareous in all parts.  Owyee soils have a calcic horizon.  Shano and Warden soils are dry more than 120 days.  Sagemoor soils have slowly permeable calcareous sediments in the control section."

These soils formed in loess and volcanic ash over loess.  They are in a semiarid climate with a mean annual precipitation of 9 to 12 inches, and cool, moist winters and warm, dry summers.  Average January temperature is about 28 degrees F, average July temperature is about 71 degrees F, and average annual temperature is 48 to 52 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 130 to 180 days."
