  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {

    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature is 50 degrees F., and the mean summer soil temperature is 72 degrees F.  The mollic epipedon is 7 to 15 inches thick and the solum, to the base of the Bt horizon is 7 to 15 inches thick.  Depth to calcareous material is 6 to 35 inches.  Organic carbon in the A horizon ranges from .7 to 3 percent and decreases uniformly with increasing depth.\nThe A horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 or 5, 2 or 3 moist and chroma of 2 or 3.  It is loam or sandy clay loam.  It has fine granular structure but it has weak subangular blocky structure in some pedons.  This horizon is soft to slightly hard.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline (pH 6.8 to 7.8).\nThe Bt horizon has hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR, value of 4 through 6, 3 through 5 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is typically clay loam, loam, sandy clay loam or sandy loam and has 18 to 35 percent clay, 10 to 45 percent silt, 20 to 65 percent sand, and 0 to 25 percent coarse fragments, mainly pebbles.  This horizon has moderate or strong prismatic or subangular blocky structure.  It is neutral or slightly alkaline (pH 6.8 to 7.6).\nThe Btk, Bk or C  horizons have hue of 2.5Y through 7.5YR value of 5 through 7 dry, 4 through 6 moist and chroma of 2 through 4.  It is loam, fine sandy loam, sandy loam, sandy clay loam, or clay loam, averaging more than 12 percent clay and is gravelly in some pedons.  These horizons are slightly alkaline to strongly alkaline (pH 8.0 to 8.5) and have about 4 to 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent."

Ascalon, Asparas, Belfon, Bresser, Capulin, Critchell, Dagflat, Featherlegs, Hargreave, Harlan, Hemingford, Kirtley, Lavate, Moskee, Recluse, Satanta, and Shalona soils have a solum to the base of the Bt, more than 15 inches thick.  In addition, Shalona soils have dry moisture control sections for 15 consecutive days from May 15 to July 15 when the soil temperature at 20 inches is greater than 41 F.  Chacuaco, Hiarc, Dagflat, and Ryegate soils have a lithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches; Bresser soils lack a k horizon in the solum; Featherlegs and Palmer Canyon soils have a 2C horizon with coarse fragments above 40 inches.  Cedak, Hargreave, Kirtley, and Rosebud soils have a paralithic contact at a depth of 20 to 40 inches.  Harlan and Sugardee soils have hue of 5YR or 2.5YR in the Bt horizon.  Datil and Wolf soils have a calcic horizon with more than 15 percent rock fragments in the lower part of the particle-size control section.  Loarc and Noden soils lack a continuous k horizon."
