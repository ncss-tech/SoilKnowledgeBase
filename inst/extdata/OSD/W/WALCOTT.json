Causewa, Hossick, Mirror, and Shakan soils have a lithic contact at 20 to 40 inches. Inpendence soils have an umbric epipedon 17 to 35 inches thick. Merredith soils have a fragmental substratum at  a depth of 20 to 40 inches. Moran soils have stones and boulders throughout the profile."

The soils formed in alluvium, glacial till, and colluvium from granites. Elevation is 7,000 to 11,000 feet. The mean annual precipitation is about 30 to 60 inches. The mean annual temperature is about 30 degrees to 34 degrees F."

The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nIn review of this description, further investigation is needed to determine dominant thickness of the epipedon to classify as Humicryepts (umbric vs. ochric)."
