The competing series section was not updated and should be reviewed after all the cryepts have been re-classified.\nIn review of this description, further investigation is needed to determine dominant thickness of the epipedon to classify as Humicryepts (umbric vs. ochric).\nNational Cooperative Soil Survey\nU.S.A."
