  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The soil is more than 60 inches deep and is very stratified.  Organic matter is less than 1 percent at the surface and decreases irregularly with increasing depth. Electrical conductivity is 2 to 16 decisiemens per meter throughout the profile. Sodium adsorption ratio is 2 to 100 usually increasing with depth. The electrical conductivity, sodium adsorption ratio and profile reaction are highly variable due to the soil amendments added to the soil by farmers, such as gypsum, which effect these values, as well as the addition of large amounts of irrigation water.  The mean annual soil temperature ranges from 64 degrees to 67 degrees F.\nThe A horizon has dry color of 2.5Y 5/2, 6/2, 7/2; or 5Y 6/2 and moist color of 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 5/2; 5Y 4/1, or 4/2.  It is clay loam, loam or silt loam.  It is slightly alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  It is slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 3 percent.\nThe B horizon has dry color of 10YR 6/2 or 7/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 5/2, 5/4, 6/2, 7/2, 7/4, N 4/0, 8/0, 8/2; 5Y 4/1, 6/2, 8/1, 8/2, 7/1 or 8/1, and moist color of 10YR 4/3; 2.5Y 3/2, 4/2, 4/4, 5/2, 6/2, 6/4, 7/2; 5Y 3/1, 3/2, 4/1, 4/2, 4/3, 5/1, 5/2; 5GY 5/1; N 3/0, 6/0; or 5B 5/1.  Iron depletions and accumulations have moist color of 5YR 3/4, 4/4; 7.5YR 4/4, 5/8; 10YR 3/3, 4/4, 5/4, 5/8, 2.5Y 6/4, 7/2, 7/6; 5Y 3/1, 4/1, 5/1; or N 3/0, 5/0; 5GY 5/1.  More than 40 percent of moist matrix colors at depths of 10 to 30 inches have chroma of 3 or more when iron depletions occur in the substratum.  When there are no iron depletions the matrix chroma is 2 or 3.  It ranges from fine sandy loam to silty clay and the particle-size control section is 18 to 35 percent clay and less than 15 percent fine sand or coarser.  This horizon is moderately alkaline to very strongly alkaline.  Calcium carbonate equivalent ranges from 1 to 14 percent.  Carbonates are disseminated and segregated in soft masses, nodules, and filaments.  Gypsum is present in some pedons."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING:  Westcamp soils are on basin rims and flood plains at elevations of 190 to 220 feet.  Slopes are 0 to 2 percent.  The soils formed in mixed alluvium weathered from sedimentary and/or igneous rocks.  The climate is arid and has hot, dry summers and mild, somewhat moist winters.  The mean annual precipitation is 6 to 7 inches.  The mean January temperature is 47 degrees F., and the mean July temperature is 85 degrees F.; the mean annual temperature is 62 to 65 degrees F.  The frost-free season is 260 to 275 days."

Boggs soils have a salic horizon.  Houser soils have a fine particle-size control section.  Kimberlina and Wasco soils have a coarse-loamy particle-size control section.  Westhaven soils have a torric moisture regime and are not artificially drained."

    "section": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY",
    "content": "DRAINAGE AND PERMEABILITY:  Somewhat poorly drained; medium or high runoff; very slow permeability.  Most areas of this soil are now artificially drained because of dams and drainage ditches in the area.  The previous water table was at a depth of 1 to 2 feet.  A water table now occurs at a depth of 4 to 6 feet.  The frequency of flooding is none to rare and the duration of flooding is more than one month."
