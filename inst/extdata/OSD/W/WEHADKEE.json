  "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS": {
    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS: Solum thickness ranges from about 20 to more than 60 inches. The content of mica flakes ranges from few to many. The soil ranges from very strongly acid through neutral, but some part of the 10 to 40 inch control section is moderately acid through neutral. Content of rock fragments ranges from 0 to 5 percent by volume in the A and B horizons, and from 0 to 20 percent by volume in the C horizons.  Fragments are dominantly pebbles in size.\nThe Ap or A horizon has hue of 10YR or 2.5Y or is neutral, value of 3 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 4. Some pedons have soft masses of iron accumulation in shades of brown or red. Texture is fine sandy loam, very fine sandy loam, loam, silty clay loam, sandy loam, or silt loam. Some pedons have recent layers of overwash as much as 20 inches thick that are loamy and variable in color. Many pedons have an Ab horizon that has the same color and texture range as the A horizon.\nThe Bg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 6, and chroma of 0 to 2. Soft masses of iron accumulation are in shades of red, yellow, and brown. Texture is sandy clay loam, silt loam, loam, clay loam, or silty clay loam.\nThe Cg horizon has hue of 10YR to 5Y or is neutral, value of 4 to 7, and chroma of 0 to 2. Soft masses of iron accumulation are in shades of brown, red, and yellow. Texture is commonly sandy loam, loam, or silt loam, but in some pedons the Cg horizon contains stratified layers of sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, loamy sand, sand, and gravel. Sandy textures are restricted to depths below 40 inches."

  "COMPETING SERIES": {
    "section": "COMPETING SERIES",
    "content": "COMPETING SERIES: There are no other known series in this family. Series in closely related families are Bibb, Chastain, Chewacla, Chowan, Englehard, Hatboro, Kinston, Lee, Mantachie, Mhoon, Muckalee, Rosebloom, and Una series. Bibb and Muckalee soils are coarse-loamy with siliceous mineralogy. Bibb soils have reaction of strongly acid or more acid throughout the control section. Chastain and Una soils are clayey and reaction is strongly acid or more acid throughout the control section. Chewacla soils have dominant chroma of more than 2 in the upper 20 inches of the soil. Chewacla soils are Fluvaquentic Dystrochrepts. Chowan, Mhoon, and Rosebloom soils are fine-silty. The subgroup for Chowan is Thapto-Histic. Englehard soils are coarse-silty and their subgroup is Humaqueptic. Hatboro soils are mesic. Kinston and Lee soils have siliceous mineralogy and reaction is strongly acid or more acid throughout the control section. Mantachie soils have siliceous mineralogy and reaction is strongly acid or more acid throughout the control section."

  "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING": {
    "section": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHIC SETTING: Wehadkee soils occur on flood plains, along streams that drain from the mountains and piedmont. Slopes are generally less than 2 percent. Wehadkee soils formed in loamy sediments washed from soils that formed from schist, gneiss, granite, phyllite, and other metamorphic and igneous rocks. Mean annual precipitation is about 48 inches near the type location and mean annual temperature is about 60 degrees F. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 37 to 69 inches, and mean annual air temperature ranges from 58 to 68 degrees F."

    "section": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS",
    "content": "GEOGRAPHICALLY ASSOCIATED SOILS: These are the competing Chewacla series and Altavista, Augusta, Buncombe, Congaree, Riverview, Roanoke, State, and Wickham series. Altavista, Augusta, Roanoke, State, and Wickham soils are on terraces and have argillic horizons. Buncombe soils are on flood plains typically beside stream channels and are sandy and excessively drained. Chewacla soils are on flood plain positions that are higher or nearer to stream channels and are somewhat poorly drained. Congaree and Riverview soils are on flood plains adjacent or near stream channels and are better drained."
