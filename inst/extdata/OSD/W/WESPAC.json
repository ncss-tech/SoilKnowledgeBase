    "section": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS",
    "content": "RANGE IN CHARACTERISTICS:  The mean annual soil temperature varies from 53 to 56 degrees F.  The thickness of the solum is 14 to 20 inches.  These soils are dry in all parts of the moisture control section (6 to 19 inches) from June 1 to November 15 (167 days) and moist in all parts from December 1 to April 15.  The soil temperature exceeds 41 degrees F from March 1 to December 1 (275 days) and exceeds 47 degrees F from April 15 to November 15.\nThe A horizon color is 10YR 5/3, 6/2 or 6/3.  Moist color is 10YR 3/2 or 3/3.  Texture is sand, fine sandy loam or silt loam.  Reaction is mildly alkaline or moderately alkaline and noneffervescent to strongly effervescent.\nThe Btn horizon color is 10YR 5/4, 6/3, 6/4, 7/2 or 7/3.  Moist color is 10YR 4/3, 4/4 or 5/4.  Texture is clay loam or sandy clay loam with a weighted average of 27 to 35 percent clay and 35 to 50 percent sand.  Reaction is moderately alkaline or strongly alkaline and slightly effervescent to violently effervescent.  SAR ranges from 13 to 60.  E.C.  ranges from 4 to 8 mmhos.\nThe Bnk and C horizon colors are 10YR 6/3, 7/3; 2.5Y 7.2, 7/3 or 8/2.  Moist colors are 10YR 4/3; 2.5Y 4/2, 4/3, 5/2, 5/4 or 5Y 4/3. Clay content ranges from 15 to 20 percent.  Some pedons lack secondary filaments of gypsum and some pedons have C horizons with secondary carbonates.  Sandy substratum phases are recognized that have stratified fine sand and sand 2C horizons at a depth of 30 to 60 inches.  E.C.  ranges from 8 to 16 mmhos and SAR ranges from 60 to 100."

Antelope Springs soils have a mean annual soil temperature of 48 to 51 degrees F and have strongly or very strongly alkaline fine textured C horizons.  Calnat soils are moderately deep to a paralithic contact.  Slipback soils have 5 to 25 percent rock fragments in the control section, have 20 to 35 inch sola and are noneffervescent in the natric horizon."
